HPA: This healthy appearing 47y old male was exercising in bike in gym when he passed out, slumping on person next to him who then lowered him to the floor and started CPR. When EMTs arrived he was in VF and he was defibrillated into sinus tach with high blood pressure. He was taken to outside hospital, very aggitated and hypertensive, intubated started on IV nitro and IV lidocaine. Echo showed gretly decreased LV function. Head CT was negative for bleed. He was transfered to [**Hospital1 2**] EW. Here was continued hypertensive and aggitated and received vesed and fentanyl and became hypotensive and was started on dopamine and sent to cath lab. In cath lab he was found to have 90% OM1 and 99% prox LAD which was thought to be culprit lesion and he had angioplasty and stent to LAD only. He had elevated filling pressures. He continued on dopmine at 8mic/kilo and lido at 2mg min. He was not started on 2B 3A [**Doctor Last Name **] as it was not clear if he had hit his head or not. He was transfered to CCU for further care.

PMH: Elevated cholesterol. On zocor and wellbutrin. Pt is adopted so family history unclear.

THis 68 year old male with long history of COPD that has worsened significantly over the past year, was transfered to CCU with worsening resp failure associated with decreased mental status and sats in the 70s. He was initally admitted to [**Hospital1 2**] [**1-/2092**] for and OSH for continued workup of multiple ulcerous lesions on both lower extremities and possible lung reduction surgery. He was to go to rehab but refused as he felt he was too ill.
Events: 1.He was tried on bi-pap on arrival, but continued to deteriorate and was intubated at 1230 without difficulty. Gas prior to intubation was 7.19/ 87/ 52/35.
2. For full details see arrest record. He had been hemodynamically stable post intubation until ~1500 when BP began to drop. He received 500NS bolus with no effect and at 1530 when levophed was started in new #18 iv in R antecub. BP came up on .06mic/kilo, but dropped again as line blew. Line was being attempted in R IJ when BP was dropping to the 50s. By 1730 HR was dropping to 40s and [**12-26**] amp of atropine was given with hr coming up only transiently. Complex widdened and BP was lost alltogether. He received CPR with a variety of rhythms and non-rhythms. He was defilbrillated X 3 at 300J, 360J, 360j. He received a total of 3 amps epi, 1 amp atropine, 3 amp of bicarb. He went back in to NSR with rate in low 100s. BP slowly came up and levophed was increased and neo added. Xray showed pneumothorax, and he had visible increasing crepetis. A needle was inserted with air being expelled and he BP coming up to the 130s. Neo was weaned off. An amiodarone bolus was given and drip has begun. Pt has remained on levo. CT [**Doctor First Name **] is now inserting chest tube.
ID: Pt has been afebrile. BC X 2, a sputum and urine C & S were sent. Pt on PO ABX.
RESP: Pt now stable on 50% AC 400 X 16 5 PEEP with gas pend. He has very decreased breath sounds bilaterally.
CV: HR 115 ST most of the day until arrest. He is now 90s NSR with BP in low 100s on increasing doses of levo. He had a R radial a-line inserted shortly after arrival.
GI: OG tube inserted and position verified by X-ray.NO stool. Miniamal gastric asp.
RENAL: Foley inserted. Urine output very poor. Urine appears consentrated.
MS/SEDATION: Pt had garbled speach, seemed confused and not cooperative upon arrival. He received etomidate and succynlcholine for intubation and received vesed and fentanyl for sedation. He was started on drips, but fentanyl was shut off at 1500 with BP drop. Versed continues going at 1mg/hr. Pt has been unresponsive since intubation.
SKIN: Dsg changed on lower legs per HO. Needs skin consult to ensure adsgs are appropriate. Area on spine reddened and entire coccyx area red. Pt clearly at risk for breakdown.
FAMILY: His wife called during code and was told to come in as pt was very ill and she should come in. She has not yet arrived.
A: Intubation, arrest, pnuemothorax
P: Monitor for hemodynamic instability. Check results of gas. Increase sedation as tolerated. [**Doctor First Name **]

 INDICATION:  Cardiac arrest, evaluate for fracture.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained through the cervical spine without
 intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformations are provided.

 CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE:  The cervical spine is imaged from C1 through the
 upper portion of T4.  No fracture is identified within the cervical spine.

 At C2-3, there is marked facet degenerative change and facet joint space
 narrowing with moderate narrowing of the right neural foramen at C2-3.

 At C5-6, there is loss of intervertebral disc space height and posterior
 spondylosis with mild left neural foraminal narrowing and mild central spinal
 stenosis.

 The prevertebral soft tissues appear within normal limits.  The visualized
 outlines of the thecal sac appear unremarkable.  CT is limited in its ability
 to provide intrathecal detail, compared with MRI.

 The visualized portions of the lung apices demonstrate ground-glass opacity
 and dependent opacities, likely representing a combination of pulmonary edema
 and atelectasis.

 IMPRESSION:  No fracture of the cervical spine.  Multilevel degenerative
 change of the cervical spine, most evident at C2-3 and C5-6.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  49 year old with cardiac arrest, assess for aortic dissection.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT of the chest with and without IV contrast.  CT of the abdomen
 and pelvis with IV contrast.  The CTA dissection protocol was used.  150 cc of
 Optiray was used for this examination due to need for fast bolus technique.
 Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.

 No prior studies for comparison.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Soft-tissue windows reveal
 several non-pathologically-enlarged axillary lymph nodes.  There is no
 significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  There are no pleural
 effusions.  Heart and pericardium are normal in appearance.  There is no
 pulmonary embolus, and the pulmonary artery is otherwise normal in appearance.
 Lung window images reveal reexpansion of the left lung after repositioning of
 the endotracheal tube. There is residual basilar atelectasis on the left, and
 to a lesser degree on the right. There is no focal consolidation or nodule
 within the lungs.  The bronchi are patent to the segmental level.  An
 endotracheal tube is seen now terminating approximately 1 to 1.5 cm above the
 carina.

 Bone windows reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions within the
 thorax.  There is an old fracture of the left 8th rib with a persistent
 lucency.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The patient is post cholecystectomy.  The
 liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenals, kidneys, intraabdominal large and small
 bowel are all normal in appearance.  There is no free fluid, free air, or
 pathologic lymphadenopathy within the abdomen.  Several tiny hypodense lesions
 are seen in the left kidney, likely representing cysts.  Focal calcification
 is seen with the appendix representing an appendicolith.  There is no evidence
 of appendicitis. Mild fat stranding is seen in the abdomen just anterior to
 Gerota's fascia bilaterally.  This is of uncertain clinical signifigance and
 may relate to recusitation efforts.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The visualized portion of the upper pelvis
 demonstrates normal-appearing bowel loops.  There is no free fluid or
                                                             (Over)

 lymphadenopathy seen in the upper pelvis.

 Bone windows reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions within abdomen or
 visualized pelvis. The patient is post laminectomy at L4.

 CT ANGIOGRAM:  Contrast-enhanced images of the aorta were obtained from the
 aortic root through the aortic bifurcation.  There is normal contrast
 enhancement with no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation or dissection throughout
 the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic aorta.  The proximal iliac arteries are
 normal in appearance.  There is normal contrast enhancement within the celiac,
 superior mesenteric, renal, and inferior mesenteric arteries.  Sagittal
 reformatted images reveal a slight impression upon the proximal celiac artery,
 possibly related to an arcuate ligament, and of questionable clinical
 significance.

 IMPRESSION:

 1) CT angiogram demonstrates no evidence of aortic aneurysm or dissection.

 2) No pulmonary embolus.

 3) Stranding anterior to Gerota's fascia of uncertain clinical signifigance.
 This may be due to recusitation efforts.

 Portable chest, [**2163-2-13**] with no prior films for comparison.

 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.

 An intraaortic balloon pump is present with the radiodense tip terminating
 approximately 3 cm below the superior aspect of the aortic knob.  An
 endotracheal tube terminates about 4.5 cm above the carina, and a Swan-Ganz
 catheter terminates in the right interlobar pulmonary artery.  The cardiac
 silhouette is normal in size.  There is vascular engorgement, and there is a
 bilateral pattern of perihilar alveolar opacities, with sparing of the extreme
 lung periphery.  This is asymmetric, right greater than left, and is
 superimposed upon a more diffuse interstitial pattern with bilateral septal
 thickening.  An area of hyperlucency is seen adjacent to both heart borders
 and probably is related to pulsation artifact.  Anterior medial pneumothoraces
 are considered less likely, but attention to these areas on followup chest
 radiograph is suggested.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lines and tubes in satisfactory position.
 2.  Extensive pulmonary edema.
 3. Hyperlucency adjacent to both heart borders.  Please see comments above.

 CLINICAL INDICATION:
 Intra-aortic balloon placement. Cardiac arrest.

 An intra-aortic balloon pump is present, terminating approximately 4.3 cm
 below the superior aspect of the aortic knob. An endotracheal tube is present
 with the distal tip terminating within 2 cm of the carina.

 Heart size is upper limits of normal. There is pulmonary vascular
 indistinctness and a diffuse interstitial pattern as well as perihilar
 haziness. No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces are identified.

 Note is also made of a Swan-Ganz catheter, terminating within the right
 ventricle with the tip directed laterally rather than superiorly toward the
 right ventricular outflow tract.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in right ventricle as detailed above. Intra-
 aortic balloon pump terminates 4.3 cm below the superior aspect of the aortic
 knob, and endotracheal tube is within 2 cm of the carina. These findings were
 all communicated with clinical service caring for the patient on the date of
 this study.

 PORTABLE CHEST:  Comparison is made to [**2197-5-22**].  The tip of the
 endotracheal tube projects approximately 5.9 cm above the carina.  The
 sideport of a nasogastric tube is likely at the gastroesophageal junction. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Pulmonary vascularity is
 unremarkable.  Diffuse increased interstitial and alveolar markings suggests
 volume overload.  There is no sizeable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION: 1) Interstital and early alveolar pulmonary edema.
             2) NG tube should be advanced for better positioning.

 INDICATION:  75-year-old female with cardiac arrest, septic shock.  Evaluate
 for retroperitoneal hematoma/abscess.

 FINDINGS:  The gallbladder is dilated without evidence of stones, wall edema,
 or pericholecystic fluid. The common bile duct is dilated all the way down to
 the periampullary region, and measures 1.3 cm in greatest diameter.  No mass
 is identified at the head of the pancreas and no stone is seen within the
 common duct.  The liver is diffusely echogenic consistent with fatty
 infiltration.  The portal vein is patent with normal direction of flow.  The
 right kidney measures 10.5 cm and a simple cyst in the upper pole measures 2.9
 cm in diameter.  The left kidney measures 10.5 cm.  The left kidney appears
 nodular and is poorly visualized.  There is a suggestion of a possible cyst at
 the upper pole of the left kidney.  When appropriate, evaluation of the left
 kidney with the CT scan is recommended.  There is no evidence of
 hydronephrosis or stones in either kidney.  There is no ascites.  A small
 right pleural effusion and a bigger left pleural effusion are identified.  A
 retroperitoneal hematoma or abscess is not identified; however, the
 retroperitoneum is not well visualized.  The spleen is unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.  Other forms of liver
 disease and more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic
 fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be exluded on this study.

 2. Common bile duct dilatation of unknown etiology.

 3. Nodular, poorly visualized left kidney with possible upper pole cyst that
 can be evaluated with CT scan when appropriate.

 PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Comparison is made to exam performed 8 hours earlier.
 There is stable moderate cardiomegaly, hilar prominence, and mild interstitial
 edema.  There are new airspace opacities within the right mid and lower lung
 zones, consistent with asymmetric edema or underlying pneumonia.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  The endotracheal tube and the enteric tube remain in
 stable, satisfactory position.

 HISTORY:  Cardiac arrest and spiking fevers.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 8:36 a.m.:

 Progressive consolidation in the right lung is most consistent with worsening
 pneumonia.  Subject to significant clinical limitations of this examination,
 there appears to be substantial left pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 longstanding.  ETT placement is standard.

 CHEST AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.

 INDICATION:  Chest tube placement, status post cardiac arrest, now intubated
 and dropping saturation again.  Assess for remaining pneumothorax.

 FINDINGS:  AP single view with patient in supine position was obtained at
 15:38 hours, [**12-4**].  The patient is intubated slightly rotated to the
 right.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  No new acute infiltrates have
 developed in the left lung and the vascular pattern does not demonstrate
 conclusive evidence for significant congestion.  Also, the left lateral
 pleural sinus remains free.  A left-sided chest tube is in place and in
 unchanged position when compared to the next previous portable chest
 examination obtained at 14:29 hours the same date.  The rather extensive
 parenchymal densities in the right lung seen both in the upper and lower lung
 fields remain rather unchanged.  Consistent with inflammatory infiltrates in
 considering the patient's history, massive aspiration in the right lung is a
 possible cause.  On chest examination obtained at 13:03 hours, suspected left-
 sided pneumothorax was a technical artifact and is not reproduced on the last
 two examinations.

 IMPRESSION:  Cardiac enlargement, no evidence of pneumothorax, stable position
 of the left-sided chest tube, extensive parenchymal infiltrates in entire
 right lung, probably aspiration related.  Telephone contact was established
 with referring physician.

 fissure measuring 7 mm.  A somewhat more irregular area of nodular
 opacification is also seen in the posterior left upper lobe measuring roughly
 7 mm.  Numerous mediastinal, prevascular, and subcarinal lymph nodes are
 present, all measuring less than 1 cm in short axis.  There is no contrast
 opacification of the heart or great vessels. Allowing for this, the aorta is
 normal in size.  A femoral approach Swan-Ganz catheter is seen with its tip
 terminating in the pulmonary artery. Coronary calcifications are present in
 the left anterior descending artery.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH ORAL CONTRAST:
 Numerous gallstones are seen in the gallbladder.  The liver, spleen, pancreas,
 and adrenals are normal in appearance.  Contrast is seen being excreted from
 the kidneys from recent contrast administration from cardiac catheterization.
 In the interpolar region of the right kidney and posterior lower pole of the
 left kidney, there are linear areas of decreased attenuation.  No mass lesion
 is identified. There is no free air or free fluid.  Several small scattered
 mesenteric lymph nodes are present.  Dense atherosclerotic calcification is
 seen in the intra-abdominal aorta.  There is an infrarenal aortic aneurysm
 measuring 3.5 cm.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL CONTRAST:
 A few scattered diverticula are seen in the sigmoid and descending colon.  The
 rectum and prostate are normal.  A Foley catheter is present within the
 bladder, and contrast materials was also seen in the bladder.  There is no
 free fluid or lymphadenopathy.  A right femoral approach Swan-Ganz catheter is
 seen in the common femoral vein and a right common femoral artery arterial
 catheter is present.

 Degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracolumbar spine.

 Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the above findings.

 INDICATION:  67-year-old man status post cardiac arrest, found unresponsive.

 COMPARISON:  No prior studies are available for comparison.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.

 FINDINGS:  There is a 7 x 13 mm region of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the
 superior right frontal lobe.  In addition there is high-density material
 tracking along the sulci of the right frontal, right parietal and left frontal
 regions.  No intraventricular hemorrhage is identified.  The ventricles are
 not dilated.  There is also a region of white matter hypodensity in the right
 frontal lobe inferior to the region of the hemorrhage.  There is no shift of
 midline structures or effacement of the basal cisterns.  The patient is
 intubated likely responsible for the opacification and air-fluid levels within
 the paranasal sinuses.  The soft tissue structures demonstrate a 1.7 cm
 rounded structure in the superficial soft tissues posterior to the cerebellum,
 which may represent a sebaceous cyst.  There is also a focus of high density
 adjacent to the right lateral ventricle best seen on series 2 image 18.

 IMPRESSION:  Intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage as described above.

 Region of hypodensity in the right frontal lobe.  This could represent a
 region of encephalomalacia from prior contusion or infarction; however, prior
 studies are not available for comparison.
 Air fluid levels / hematoma noted in the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses. An
 underlying fractures cannot be excluded. CT of the facial bones / sinuses is
 recommended for further evaluation.

 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY [**2142-11-2**]  AT 12:55 P.M:

 COMPARISON:  [**2142-11-2**] at 9:42 a.m.

 INDICATION:  Recent cardiac arrest.

 Since the recent chest radiograph, an endotracheal tube has been repositioned,
 now terminating approximately 3 1/2 cm above the carina.  The cuff appears
 slightly over-distended.  A Swan-Ganz catheter has been placed, with distal
 tip overlying the lateral aspect of the right hilum.  Right subclavian central
 venous catheter has also been placed, with tip terminating in the expected
 location of the superior vena cava.  Nasogastric tube courses below the
 diaphragm.  No pneumothorax is evident on the supine study.

 The heart size remains normal.  There is persistent upper lobe volume loss,
 and the upward displacement of the pulmonary hila, and areas of apparent
 scarring and bronchiectasis likely related to prior granulomatous infection
 given the presence of small calcified granulomas.  Additionally, a poorly
 defined opacity in the right upper lobe appears slightly worse compared to the
 admission chest radiograph of [**2142-10-31**], and there is also a
 questionable developing area of opacity centrally in the left upper lobe.

 IMPRESSION:

 1) Repositioning of endotracheal tube, now in standard position; however, the
 cuff is likely over distended.

 2)  Swan-Ganz catheter tip overlies lateral aspect of right hilar pulmonary
 artery.

 3) Questionable evolving bilateral upper lobe opacities superimposed upon
 changes of prior granulomatous infection.  These findings may be due to acute
 aspiration, infectious pneumonia including reactivation TB, or asymmetrical
 edema. Findings communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24917**] by telephone on [**2142-11-2**].

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  32-year-old woman S/P cardiac arrest.  CT is requested to better
 evaluate degree of lung parenchymal disease and pleural effusion.  There is
 also a clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolis, but due to renal failure, and
 a non-contrast chest CT has thus been requested.

 Helical CT of the thorax was performed without intravenous or oral contrast
 administration.  Images were acquired with 5 mm collimation and reconstructed
 at 5 mm intervals throughout the thorax.

 An endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in satisfactory position.

 Assessment of the lungs revealed multilobar alveolar consolidation and ground-
 glass opacity, which is most pronounced in the lower lobes and right upper
 lobe but involves all lobes of both lungs.  The consolidative changes are most
 pronounced in the dependent portions of the lungs but there are some non-
 dependent areas of involvement as well.  No obstructing central interbronchial
 lesions are observed.

 Soft tissue structures of the thorax reveal diffuse soft tissue stranding
 throughout the chest wall and abdominal wall consistent with diffuse anasarca.
  There are also edematous changes within the mediastinal fat.  There are small
 pleural effusions present bilaterally.  Houndsfield units of the fluid are
 consistent with simple pleural fluid.  The heart is mildly enlarged for a
 patient of this age.

 Imaging of the upper portion of the abdomen demonstrates the presence of
 ascites.  There is also non-specific mesenteric stranding.  The kidneys appear
 slightly enlarged and demonstrate bilateral perinephrenic stranding.  The
 adrenal glands demonstrate slight thickening on the left but no discrete mass
 is observed.  The imaged portion of the liver is normal in appearance and the
 spleen is unremarkable.  No focal abnormalities are seen in the imaged portion
 of the pancreas.  Tiny linear high density areas in right lower lobe
 posteriorly may relate to aspirated barium.  Evolving aspiration pneumonia
 should be considered.

 Skeletal structures of the thorax reveal no suspicious lytic or blastic
 skeletal lesions.

 IMPRESSION:  1)  Multilobar distribution of alveolar consolidation and ground-
 glass opacities effecting the right lung to a greater degree than the left,
 with the dependent portions of the lungs most involved. Diagnostic

 5)  Incompletely imaged kidneys demonstrating apparent nephromegaly and non-
 specific perinephric stranding.  This may be related to the patient's acute
 renal failure.

 Portable chest of [**2169-5-31**] compared to previous study of earlier the same
 day.

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Pleural effusion.  Clinical suspicion for pulmonary
 embolus.

 An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position.  The heart size is upper
 limits of normal for technique and stable compared to the previous study.  The
 pulmonary vascularity appears engorged.  There is bilateral asymmetric
 perihilar alveolar pattern affecting the right lung to a greater degree than
 the left.  There is also more dense homogeneous consolidation involving the
 entirety of the right middle and right lower lobes with obscuration of both
 the right heart border and right hemidiaphragm.  There may also be a component
 of pleural effusion but the predominant abnormality appears to be that of
 consolidation.

 When comparison is made to earlier study of the same date, the degree of
 consolidation in the right middle and right lower lobes has progressed in the
 interval.

 IMPRESSION:

 1) Endotracheal tube in satisfactory position.

 2) Markedly asymmetric bilateral alveolar pattern.  This is most confluent in
 the right middle and right lower lobes.  Diagnostic considerations include
 asymmetric pulmonary edema pattern, massive pulmonary aspiration, and
 multifocal pneumonia.

 3) There is likely a component of pleural effusion present, but the
 predominant finding appears to be consolidation.

 4) Considering clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolus, further evaluation
 with CT angiogram may be helpful.

 SINGLE CHEST:  This is compared with prior chest radiograph from [**2169-5-31**].
 There is interval placement of NG tube terminating in the stomach.  The ET
 tube is of no interval change in position. There appears to be interval
 increase in the size of the right pleural effusion. There is also probable
 interval development of a left pleural effusion, but not adequately assessed
 on this film because the left costophrenic angle is cut off on this study. A
 left retrocardiac opacity is demonstrated, with air bronchograms, which is
 concerning for a new consolidation.  There is persistent right lung
 consolidation.

 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right lung consolidation.  Interval increase in right
 pleural effusion. The interval development of left retrocardiac consolidation.
 Probable small left pleural effusion.  This is not adequately evaluated to the
 left costophrenic angle is cut off on this study.  Recommend a repeat chest
 radiograph with no extra charge to the patient for better assesssment.

 INDICATION:  Unresponsive.  History of malignancy.

 NONCONTRAST HEAD CT:  No priors for comparison.  A large intraparenchymal
 hemorrhage within the posterior fossa is identified compressed in the
 brainstem and obliterating the ventricles and basal cisterns.  There is also
 suggestion of hydrocephalus, with dilatation of the third and lateral
 ventricles, and hypodensity around the frontal and occipital horns.  The sulci
 appear somewhat effaced.  There is poor differentiation of the [**Doctor Last Name 37**]-white
 junction.  No shift of normally midline structures, acute major vascular
 territorial infarct, is identified.  There is scattered opacification of left
 mastoid air cells, but other imaged sinuses are clear.  The patient is
 intubated.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large intraparenchymal bleed in posterior fossa causing severe compression
 of the brainstem.  This was relayed immediately to the ED dashboard and
 discussed in person with the intern taking care of the patient.  Emergent
 neurosurgical consultation was advised.
 2.  Probable associated communicating hydrocephalus, with obliteration of the
 fourth ventricle and basilar cisterns, diffuse sulcal effacement of the
 supratentorial region, dilatation of remaining ventricles and probable
 transependymal edema.
 3.  Poor [**Doctor Last Name 37**]-white differentiation, which may be due to global hypoxemia.

 ATTENDING EDIT: This should read ""obstructive hydrocephalus"", not
 ""communicating"".
 The brainstem is hypodense, worrisome for infarction.

 There is no comparison exam.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Widened mediastinum evaluate for dissection.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were obtained.
 Pre-contrast images through the thorax were obtained.  Post-contrast images
 through the chest abdomen and pelvis were obtained with coronal and sagittal
 reformats.

 CT CHEST PRE AND POST-CONTRAST FINDINGS:  There is no dense intramural
 hematoma present in the aorta.  There is no aortic dissection.  There are
 innumerable soft tissue masses present throughout the thorax.  The largest of
 these is in the right lower lobe and measures approximately 5.2 x 3.9 cm.
 There is consolidation in the left lower lobe.  The osseous structures of the
 thorax demonstrate no lytic or blastic lesions.

 CT ABDOMEN FINDINGS:  The liver is more than 50% replaced by metastatic
 lesions.  Large metastatic lesion in the left lobe of the liver extends out of
 the intra-abdominal cavity into the subcutaneous soft tissues.  This should be
 palpable by physical exam.  Gallstones are present.  Innumerable
 pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are present throughout the abdomen.  There
 are no dilated bowel loops.  A peritoneal metastatic disease is present.  No
 masses are seen in the pancreas.  No solid masses are seen in the kidneys.
 There is a simple cyst in the upper pole of left kidney.  The adrenal glands
 appear normal.  The celiac axis and the SMA and the [**Female First Name (un) 635**] are patent.  There is
 no aneurysm or dissection involving the abdominal aorta.  There is aortic
 atherosclerosis.

 No blastic or lytic lesions are present in the osseous structures of the
 abdomen.

 CT PELVIS FINDINGS:  There is pelvic free fluid.  There is thickening of the
 sigmoid colon and descending colon.  The remainder of the left colon was not
 visualized on this exam.  Numerous soft tissue nodules are present in the
 pelvis consistent with metastatic disease.  Bone windows demonstrate a lytic
 lesion in the right sacrum at the S1 level.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, sepsis and hypotension, status post cardiac arrest and
 resuscitation.  Assess for ischemic bowel versus perforated viscus.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic
 symphysis following the administration of 100 cc of intravenous Optiray.
 Additional delayed images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis.
 Coronal and sagittal reformations are provided.

 CONTRAST:  Oral water-soluble contrast and intravenous nonionic contrast were
 administered due to the rapid rate of bolus injection required for this
 examination.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There are bilateral low-density
 pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.  There is cardiomegaly.  There is
 a moderate amount of ascites throughout the abdomen.  The liver is small and
 demonstrates a nodular contour consistent with cirrhosis.  There is a tiny,
 rounded, hypodense lesion within the right lobe of the liver posteriorly.
 There is marked periportal edema.  The gallbladder is nondistended but
 demonstrates marked gallbladder wall edema and gallbladder mucosal
 enhancement.  There is splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 17.4 cm.  The
 pancreas appears unremarkable.  There are several enlarged periportal lymph
 nodes measuring up to 1 cm in short axis diameter.  The superior mesenteric

 vein and portal vein appear patent.  The adrenals are densely enhancing
 bilaterally.  There is minimal contrast enhancement of either kidney.  The
 renal arteries appear patent proximally.  The aorta is normal in caliber.  The
 celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, and inferior mesenteric artery
 appear markedly narrowed, without focal occlusion.  A replaced right hepatic
 artery arises from the SMA.

 There is marked stranding throughout the mesentery and retroperitoneum.  There
 is dilation of multiple loops of small bowel and abnormal bowel mucosal
 thickening within the dilated loops of proximal and mid small bowel. There is
 marked diffuse colonic mucosal thickening with enhancement of the colonic
 mucosa.  No pneumatosis or mesenteric venous gas is identified. There is no
 free air within the abdomen.

 There is minimal contrast enhancement of the kidneys.  A rounded, hypodense
 lesion is seen within the interpolar region of the left kidney.  Additional
 hypodense lesions are seen within the upper pole of the left kidney and
 interpolar region of the right kidney.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is a moderate amount of
 ascites within the pelvis.  A Foley catheter is in place within the bladder.
 The prostate and seminal vesicles and rectum appear unremarkable.  There is
 mucosal thickening and enhancement involving the sigmoid colon and visualized
 portion of the descending colon.  There is no pathologic appearing pelvic or
 inguinal lymphadenopathy and no free air within the pelvis.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Bone windows demonstrate no evidence of suspicious lytic or
 sclerotic osseous lesions.

 MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS:  Coronal and sagittal reformations demonstrate ascites,
 marked splenomegaly, and mucosal thickening and dilation of small bowel, as
 well as marked mucosal thickening involving the colon.  The multiplanar
 reformations demonstrate contrast opacification of the superior mesenteric and
 inferior mesenteric arteries, although the vessels appear markedly narrowed.
 The value grade of multiplanar reformats is 2.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Diffuse colonic mucosal thickening and mucosal enhancement, and marked
 small bowel mucosal thickening, enhancement and dilation.  Marked narrowing of
 the central mesenteric vessels without occlusion.  In the setting of
 hypotension and cardiac resuscitation, the findings are suggestive of bowel
 ischemia / shock bowel.
 2. Hepatic cirrhosis with splenomegaly and ascites.
 3.  Minimal renal enhancement, suggestive of renal failure.
 4.  Dense enhancement of the adrenal glands, consistent with hypoperfusion.

 INDICATION:  CHF, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease.
 Intubation post cardiac arrest.

 FINDINGS:  A single AP supine chest image is provided.  Comparison study dated
 [**2130-11-14**].  The heart again shows fairly marked left ventricular enlargement.
 The pulmonary vessels are difficult to evaluate but appear improved since the
 prior study.  There is better lung inflation involving primarily the upper
 lobes.  Bilateral lower lobe collapse and consolidation is again noted.
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles is consistent with bilateral pleural
 effusions.  The ETT is shown to be in good position.

 IMPRESSION:  Allowing for postural differences there is evidence of improved
 lung inflation and probable improved left heart failure.  However bilateral
 lower lobe collapse and consolidation are still present.

 AP supine portable chest [**2102-4-23**] at 8:30 AM: No old films are available for
 comparison. The patient is intubated. The tip of the ET tube is at the level
 of the aortic arch. There is a Swan-Ganz catheter in place passing up through
 the inferior vena cava with its tip in the right pulmonary artery. There is a
 nasogastric tube in place with its tip in the fundus of the stomach. Left
 central venous catheter tip is in the left brachiocephalic vein. There is no
 evidence of a pneumothorax although this is a supine film and it is difficult
 to assess. Increased interstitial markings are present bilaterally and there
 is increased pulmonary opacity at the left base which may reflect acute
 infiltrate or aspiration. Blunted left CP angle suggests left pleural
 effusion.

 INDICATION:  49-year-old man status post cardiac arrest, asystolic, now with
 large mediastinum on chest x-ray.  Evaluate for pulmonary embolism.

 COMPARISON:  AP portable chest x-ray dated [**2182-5-19**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT imaging of the chest was performed before and after the
 administration of 100 cc of intravenous Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was
 administered per protocol.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were
 obtained.

 CT ANGIOGRAM CHEST:  Endotracheal tube is in place.  A nasogastric tube
 terminates in the distal esophagus.  A temporary epicardial pacing wire is
 curled within the right atrium.

 There are no filling defects within the pulmonary artery, proximal, or distal
 branches to suggest the presence of a pulmonary embolism.  Low-density fluid
 is seen within the mediastinum, and in the superior pericardial recess.  There
 is no pericardial effusion.  The heart is enlarged.  Mild calcifications are
 seen along the coronary arteries, in particular the left anterior descending.
 The aorta is normal in caliber and contour without evidence of dissection or
 aneurysmal dilatation.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions with
 compressive atelectasis.  No additional areas of consolidation are seen within
 the lungs.

 CT imaging of the upper abdomen reveals a small amount of perihepatic ascites.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
 abnormalities.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.

 2.  Cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions, and a small amount of
 intra-abdominal ascites.  The findings are most consistent with right heart
 failure.

 No comparison studies.

 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The tip of the endotracheal tube is at the
 thoracic inlet, approximately 5 cm from the carina.  There is a left
 subclavian placed Swan-Ganz catheter with tip in the right ventricle. The
 heart is enlarged.  Mediastinal contours demonstrate what appears to be
 fullness superiorly and a prominent left pulmonary artery with questionable
 partial collapse of the left upper lobe.  Similarly on the right, there is
 slight obscuration of the right upper mediastinum, which also could represent
 partial collapse of the right upper lobe. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

 IMPRESSION:

 Endotracheal tube in standard position.  Swan-Ganz catheter tip in the right
 ventricle. Question of pericardial effusion given mediastinal fullness and
 cardiac silloutte.  Possible bilateral upper lobe partial collapse. Please

 INDICATION:  Status post bradycardiac arrest, intubated, IABP in place, pacer
 in place, check positions.

 No comparisons.

 CHEST, SINGLE VIEW:  The ET tube is approximately 4 cm above the carina.  The
 NG tube terminates below the left hemidiaphragm, the distal end of which is
 not included on the study.  A SG catheter has been placed via femoral
 approach, terminating in the right pulmonary artery.  Cardiac pacer has also
 been placed via femoral approach, projecting over the right atrium.

 The heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and calcified.
 Multifocal air space opacities are present, most prominent in the right upper
 lobe.  A small patchy opacity is also present in the left upper lung zone.
 There are no pleural effusions.

 IMPRESSION:  Position of lines and tubes as described above.  A lateral view
 would be helpful to confirm the position of the pacemaker leads.

 Air space opacities most prominent in the right upper lobe, probably
 represent aspiration.  Pneumonia should also be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.

  infection.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  The patient found down at home with cardiac arrest of unknown
 etiology.  Evaluate for pulmonary embolus.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the torso of the same day.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the chest were obtained without
 contrast.  Subsequently, following the administration of 100 cc of Optiray,
 contiguous axial images through the chest were obtained during opacification
 of the pulmonary artery and aorta.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were
 obtained.

 CTA OF THE CHEST:  There are no filling defects within the pulmonary arterial
 vessels to suggest a pulmonary embolus.  The aorta is of normal caliber, and
 there is no evidence of thoracic aortic dissection.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  Since the prior CT of earlier
 today, there is increased patchy nodular opacities within the lung bases
 bilaterally.  There is persistent ground-glass opacity in the right middle
 lobe.  The findings are concerning for aspiration or atypical infection. There
 is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  The central airways are patent to the
 level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.  Endotracheal and nasogastric
 tubes are in place.  The endotracheal tube terminates a few cm superior to the
 carina.  A left subclavian central venous catheter is noted, with the tip
 within the superior vena cava.  No pleural or pericardial effusions.  No
 pathologically enlarged axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.

 Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, the visualized portion of the
 liver is of low attenuation, consistent with fatty infiltration.  Imaged
 portion of the spleen is unremarkable.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.

 Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy and
 pathology in this case (grade 1).

 INDICATION:  58-year-old male status post cardiac arrest.  Now intubated.
 TECHNIQUE:  AP supine single view of the chest.

 FINDINGS:  The ET tube tip is located approximately 6 cm from the carina.  It
 appears to be in good position.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  There is
 also perihilar haziness, which could represent some pulmonary edema vs. fluid
 overload.  There is a left lower lobe opacity that could represent atelectasis
 or consolidation.  Differential diagnosis also includes aspiration.  Recommend
 repeating radiograph after the patient is more stable.  Left mid lung zone
 plate-like atelectasis.  No obvious rib fractures are seen in this radiograph.

 IMPRESSION:
 1)  The ET tube is in good position.
 2)  Cardiomegaly.
 3)  Left lower lobe consolidation vs. atelectasis.  The differential diagnosis
 include aspiration in this patient with cardiac arrest.
 4)  Plate-like atelectasis in the left mid lung zone.

 5) Questionable pulmonary edema.  This could be better evaluated with an
 repeat chest radiograph.

 INDICATION: S/p placement of NG tube.  Prior radiograph could not evaluate the
 tip.

 TECHNIQUE: AP single view of the chest.

 FINDINGS: The ET tube is in good position.  The NG tube tip cannot be seen. A
 radiograph of the upper abdomen needs to repeated  to confirm the position.

 Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable when compared to prior study. There
 is interval worsening of perihilar hazyness and interstitial lines. The
 mediastinal contour is stable. There is a interval worsening of left
 retrocardiac opacity which could represent atelectasis or consolidation. There
 is also probably a left pleural effusion.

 IMPRESSION:
 1)  The NG tube tip cannot be visualized. Recommend radiograph of the upper
 abdomen for further evaluation.
 2)  Interval worsening of left retrocardiac opacity and left pleural effusion.
 The opacity could be due to atelectasis or consolidation.

 COMPARISON:  Previous study of earlier the same day.

 INDICATION:  Tube placement.

 A nasogastric tube has been placed, and tip appears to be above the level of
 the diaphragm within the lower thoracic esophagus.  Endotracheal tube is in
 satisfactory position.  Examination is limited due to extensive motion
 artifact, limiting assessment of the lung parenchyma and pulmonary
 vascularity.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are grossly stable.

 IMPRESSION:  Nasogastric tube terminates above the level of the diaphragm and
 should be advanced for more optimal placement.

 anteriorly.  High density hemorrhage is also seen tracking laterally to the
 perirenal space.  There is low density ascites around the liver and spleen,
 tracking into the right paracolic gutter and into the right hemipelvis. The
 vessel closest to the hematina is the left common iliac artery, just at its
 bifurcation.

 There are severe arterial calcifications of the aorta, splenic artery, SMA,
 celiac axis, renal arteries, and iliac vessels.

 The liver itself appears normal.  The pancreas does not appear edematous. The
 renal parenchyma appears normal.  Contrast is seen only within the proximal
 small bowel and stomach.  Much of the distal bowel is collapsed and difficult
 to evaluate, however, there does not appear to be any bowel thickening. There
 is no bowel dilatation.  The bladder contains a Foley and is collapsed.

 CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The patient has a left femoral central line.
 There is no pelvic mass.  No suspicious osseous lesions are seen.

 IMPRESSION:

 1. Large left sided retroperitoneal hematoma with a hematocrit level.  The
 artery closest to this collection is the left common iliac artery at its
 bifurcation.  However, this is not predictive of the source of hemorrhage.

 INDICATION:  77 year old female patient with acute hypotension and cardiac
 arrest. Acute loss of pulses in her lower extremities.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were acquired from the base of the neck to
 the upper abdomen at 5mm intervals before the administration of intravenous
 contrast.

 Then, contiguous axial images were acquired from the base of the neck to the
 pubic symphysis at 5mm intervals after the uneventful administration of 150cc
 of Optiray contrast medium intravenously. Delayed images through the abdomen
 and pelvis were then acquired.

 AORTIC CTA:

 There is no aortic dissection. Significant atheromatous disease is seen at the
 thoracic and abdominal aorta and branches. An occluded infrarenal abdominal
 aorta is seen just superior to the level of the bifurcation. No intravenous
 contrast is seen distal to this point. No major collateral vessels are
 identified. The renal arteries are patent bilaterally.

 Evaluation of the pulmonary arteries demonstrates no evidence of pulmonary
 embolism.

 CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Significant atheromatous
 disease is seen at the aorta and coronary arteries. The lungs are clear. There
 are no nodules or masses.  There is no pneumothorax.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  No liver masses are
 identified. The intra and extrahepatic biliary tree appears prominent, but
 within normal limits for this patient's age. The gallbladder wall thickness is
 normal. There are multiple gallstones seen. The adrenal glands and pancreas
 are normal. The spleen demonstrates a large segmental wedge-shaped defect
 which likely represents an infarct. Likewise, the right kidney also
 demonstrates a segmental wedge-shaped defect which likely represents an acute
 infarct. Otherwise, there is symmetric contrast enhancement and excretion at
 the kidneys bilaterally. No renal masses are identified. There is no
 significant intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal lymph adenopathy. There is no
 free intraperitoneal fluid or pneumoperitoneum. The bowel wall thickness
 appears normal.

 A right subclavian vascular catheter terminates in the superior vena cava and
 a Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the proximal left pulmonary artery.  An
 endotracheal tube remains in place, with the tip terminating approximately 1.5
 cm above the carina.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in the
 interval.  There are increasing patchy opacities present at both lung bases,
 and there are probable bilateral pleural effusions with the left extending to
 the apex.  The extreme lung bases have been excluded from the radiograph,
 limiting assessment.

 IMPRESSION:

 AP PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST:

 Compared to previous study of earlier the same day.

 INDICATION: Pacing wire placement.

 The patient is markedly rotated towards the right. 2 pacing leads remain in
 place, and appear unchanged in position allowing for differences in patient
 positioning. The right internal jugular vascular catheter is in satisfactory
 position and an ETT remains in place, with a relatively low position about 2.5
 cm above the carina. Intra-aortic balloon pump is in close proximity to the
 superior aspect of the aortic knob near the expected location of the origin of
 the left subclavian artery.

 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable allowing for the degree of
 rotation of the patient. There are scattered areas of atelectasis in both
 lungs, and there is a hazy area of increased opacity in the left mid lung zone
 which may relate to an area of loculated pleural fluid. Additionally, pleural
 fluid tracks to the apex of the left lung. Note is made of interval improved
 aeration at the lung bases compared to the recent study.

 IMPRESSION: 1) Intra-aortic balloon pump in close proximity to superior aspect
 of aortic knob and relatively low position of ETT. These findings have been
 communicated with the clinical service caring for the patient.

 2) Improving aeration at lung bases.

 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral [**2188-10-22**].

 SINGLE VIEW CHEST, AP:  There has been interval placement of a ETT, left
 subclavian central line and removal of a right IJ central line.  The ETT is
 approximately 5 cm above the carina.  The left subclavian central line tip
 lies within the distal brachiocephalic vein.  The right costophrenic angle is
 cut off the film, however there appears to be bilateral pleural effusions. The
 left ventricular enlargement and enlarged cardiac contour (s/p CABG) are
 unchanged when compared to the previous exam.  There are increased
 interstitial opacities, predominantly in the upper lobes.  The pleural
 thickening of the right upper lobe as well as the bulla over the perihilar
 region are unchanged when compared to the previous exams.

 IMPRESSION:  Tubes and lines as described above.  Unchanged appearance of ARDS
 vs. CHF with underlying lung disease.

 CHEST:

 INDICATION:  Lower extremity bypass.  Found in cardiac arrest.  Status post
 intubation.  Rule out pneumonia, CHF.

 FINDINGS:  A single AP semi-upright view.  Comparison study taken [**10-26**] in
 supine position.  Allowing for postural differences the appearances remain
 unchanged.  Bilateral upper and mid zone interstitial infiltrates are again
 noted.  There is marked pleural widening over the right lung apex and there is
 blunting of the right CP angle.  A small effusion is also noted on the left
 side.  The heart shows LV enlargement and status post CABG surgery.

 IMPRESSION:

 The appearances remain unchanged since the prior study.  Interstitial lung
 infiltrates and pleural effusions are again noted.  The NG line has been
 removed.  The other lines remain satisfactory.

   Chief Complaint:  Hypoxic respiratory distress
   HPI:
   See admission H+P for full details. This is a 59 yo female with DM1,
   torsades s/p ICD, left main thrombosis with cardiac arrest during
   cardiac cath complicated by anoxic brain injury, systolic and diastolic
   HF, CKD and several admissions over the last several months for acute
   heart failure, delirium and aspiration pneumonia. She was admitted on
   [**4-17**] after failed outpatient diuresis at [**Hospital 12**] Rehab with furosemide
   and spironolactone, which was limited by acute renal failure. On
   admission, she was 50 pounds above dry weight, with dyspnea and
   slightly worsening delirium from her baseline.
   On the floor, she was being diuresed with a furosemide gtt, maintaining
   a UOP of ~100 ml/hr. Throughout this admission, the patient has
   frequently complained of dyspnea. However, at 4pm on [**2118-4-21**], she noted
   worsening dyspnea (no chest pain) and was found to have SpO2 of 82% on
   2L,NC with labored respirations and RR in the upper 30s. At that time,
   SBP 140s with HR 90s. She was given nebs with little improvement in
   oxygenation. She was then placed on NRB with improvement to SpO2
   90-93%. She was also given SL nitro x1 in case of flash pulmonary
   edema. EKG was unchanged from prior. There was no clear evidence of
   aspiration prior to the event.
   On arrival to the ICU, patient still endorses dyspnea, although
   improved with NRB. She also notes intermittent nausea, as well as RLQ
   pain for the past two days and constipation (although last BM was
   today). Her husband is not able to corroborate that she has had these
   GI complaints. She also notes chronic orthopnea, nonproductive cough
   x3d, poor appetite and feeling achy. She denies palpitations, chest
   pain, HA, fever, chills, PND.

   Imaging: CXR [**4-21**] (my read): increased bilateral pulmonary edema from
   prior.
   TTE [**2118-3-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
   normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the mid to distal anterior wall,
   lateral wall, apex, and distal inferior wall. The remaining segments
   contract normally (LVEF = 35-40 %). The diameters of aorta at the
   sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**2-5**]+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dsyfunction
   consistent with coronary artery disease. Mild to moderate mitral
   regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2118-2-28**], the right
   ventricle is not well seen on the current study. The other findings are
   similar.
   ECG: EKG [**4-21**]: Likely sinus rhythm at 93bpm, low voltage in limb leads,
   shaky baseline, nonspecific ST-T changes, QTc 417
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 yo female with DM1, extensive cardiac hx including CAD,
   systolic and diastolic HF, admitted with acute on chronic HF and
   transferred to the CCU for hypoxia.
   # HYPOXIA: Precipitant not entirely clear. Crackles and CXR consistent
   with flash edema, although no clear trigger such as hypertension or
   tachycardia. Aspiration event also possible given h/o this, as well as
   mild leukocytosis and fever. Other causes include mucus plug (no
   secretions, so unlikely), PE (possible, but patient not currently
   stable for V/Q and would address above issues first). ABG suggests
   profound A-a gradient, given PaO2 of 64 on NRB.
   - Low threshold for BiPAP if hypoxia persists or worsens
   - Furosemide 80mg IV bolus and continue gtt to maintain 100ml/hr UOP
   - Start NTG gtt for acute pulmonary edema
   - Broad-spectrum abx in case of HAP including aspiration: vancomycin,
   cefepime, metronidazole
   - Cycle cardiac markers to evaluate for ischemia
   - Send blood and urine cultures given fevers
   - Repeat CXR in am
   - If above interventions not helpful, consider evaluating for PE
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC HF: On furosemide drip,
   managing acute component as above under hypoxia. Per floor team, her
   edema has improved with diuresis, although she remains grossly
   overloaded on exam.
   - Furosemide gtt as above
   - Cont losartan and metoprolol
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while diuresing
   - Considerations if she becomes refractory to diuretics include
   inotropic support or CVVH.
   - Continue spironolactone 25 mg PO/NG DAILY
   # Delirium:  Pt with history of agitation and delirium, responsive to
   Zyprexa. This agitation likely exacerbates her respiratory
   difficulties. Psych following.
   - Cont zyprexa 2.5mg QHS and PRN, monitor QTc with daily EKG
   - Cont traZODONE 25 mg PO/NG HS
   - F/u psych recs
   # CAD:  Stable, no evidence of active ischemia.
   - Continue aspirin 81 mg, simvastatin 80 mg daily, plavix 75 mg,
   metoprolol
   - Trending cardiac markers as above
   # HTN: Remains around recent baseline of SBP 140.
   - Cont metoprolol and losartan
   - Nitro gtt will also help
   # Monoclonal spike: Has monoclonal gammopathy on SPEP, ? if underlying
   myeloma. There has been some mention of amyloid in prior notes this
   admission.
   - No acute interventions, will speak with her floor team tomorrow to
   understand any established plans for this
   # DIABETES:
   - Continue glargine plus HISS
   - Cont gabapentin for neuropathy
   # DEPRESSION/ANXIETY:
   - Cont fluoxetine 60 mg PO/NG DAILY
   # HYPOTHYROIDISM:
   - Cont levothyroxine
   # FEN: low Na cardiac diet (once respiratory status stabilizes)
   - Monitor hypernatremia
   - Nutrition c/s given low albumin and poor POs

 [**Hospital 2**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
  66 year old woman admitted with VF arrest s/p inferior-posterior MI. Now with
  neurologic findings, unconscious and seizures.
 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  ? anoxic injury, ? hemorrhage
 No contraindications for IV contrast
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: Cardiac arrest. Now with neurologic findings including loss of
 consciousness and seizures.

 There is no prior study for comparison.

 TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT.

 FINDINGS: Without prior exam for comparison, considering the patient's age,
 there is apparent effacement of the sulci diffusely throughout the brain
 parenchyma suggestive of possible global swelling. No global or focal areas of
 hypodensity are appreciated to suggest regional or global infarctions,
 respectively, at this time. There is no shift of the normally midline
 structures. No intracranial hemorrage is appreciated.

 Air-fluid levels are identified within the maxillary sinuses and sphenoid air
 cells, and there is mucosal thickening seen within the ethmoid air cells.
 Findings are likely related to the patient's intubated status.

 IMPRESSION: Apparent global effacement of the sulci suggestive of global
 swelling, with no evidence of global or regional infarction at this time.
 Recommendation is for a followup scan and/or MRI examination if the patient's
 symptoms are not improved.

Not ventilating therefore increased fi02 and PPEP, with little response, became more hemodynamically unstable, incressed levophed, and started dobuatamine, gave further fluid bolus which saw slight improvement in SBP and o2 sat. However this declined once fluid bolus stopped, started vassopressin and dopamine, again saw slight improvment which was short lived. Many mebers of family came into see Mrs [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] all very upset, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1268**] spoke to them about resusitation ( family updated by attending dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] PCP earlier in the evening and informed of poor prognosis). and said that as she ws on maximum ventilatory and cardiac supoort and that these were not helping, if she were to go in to cardiac arrest then it would be futile to begin CPR as there would be nothing more we could do and she would not make a meaningful recvoery, the family agreed to this. Family present as vital signs deteriroated, told that she her condition was deteriorating, SBP dropping, in paced rhytham, family requested that monitor be left on sp that they could she when she died.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast head CT.

 CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:  There is a small area of hypoattenuation within the
 right centrum semiovale, best seen on Series 2, Image 19.  This most likely
 represents a subacute or chronic infarct and measures approximately 2 cm.
 There is also an area of encephalomalacia within the left periventricular
 white matter, which is slightly distorting the lateral wall of the left
 lateral ventricle. This most likely represents another old infarct.  There is
 no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus or shift of normally
 midline structures. The [**Doctor Last Name 265**]-white matter differentiation appears intact
 throughout.

 There are air-fluid levels within both maxillary sinuses. The rest of the
 paranasal sinuses are well aerated.  The rest of the surrounding osseous and
 soft tissue structures are unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:  Area of hypoattenuation within the right parietal white matter,
 as well as within the left periventricular white matter.  These are most
 likely old infarcts.  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.

 INDICATION:  Status post cardiac arrest.

 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest is compared with the prior
 study from 10 hours ago.

 FINDINGS:  The patient is on a resuscitation board, with interval intubation.
 Endotracheal tube is in appropriate position, 7 cm from the carina.  Right
 sided PICC catheter remains in place, terminating in the upper SVC.  NG tube
 remains in appropriate position.  There has been interval placement of a
 femoral Swan-Ganz catheter, which terminates in the right intralobar artery.
 There is a moderate sized right sided pneumothorax, with extensive bilateral
 subcutaneous emphysema.  There also is the appearance of a pneumomediastinum
 and pneumopericardium, though detail is obscured by subcutaneous emphysema.
 No gross rib fractures are identified.

 IMPRESSION:

 Right sided pneumothorax and extensive subcutaneous emphysema, presumably
 related to cardiac arrest and resuscitation.

 INDICATION:  Status post arrest with fall.

 SINGLE VIEW CHEST:  There are no prior examinations available on PACS.  The
 patient is status post median sternotomy.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are grossly unremarkable, given AP supine technique.  The
 endotracheal tube is 3 cm above the carina.  The NG tube appears to be coiled
 in the mid-esophagus, and the tip appears to be superior to the superior
 border of the chest radiograph.  The lungs are clear.  The pulmonary vessels
 have an unremarkable appearance.  There is no evidence for pneumothorax.  No
 fractures are identified, though evaluation of the ribs is limited on this
 single view.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  The NG tube appears to be coiled in the mid-esophagus and should be
 repositioned.  The endotracheal tube is in appropriate position.
 2.  No lung infiltrates identified.

 INDICATION:  Severe COPD, respiratory distress, endotracheal tube placement.

 PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Comparison is made to the study from [**2117-10-10**].
 Again seen is an endotracheal tube in satisfactory position in the mid-
 trachea, a right internal jugular central venous line with the tip in the
 distal SVC, and an NG tube with the tip not visualized, off the inferior film
 edge.  The cardiac size is stable.  There is continued pulmonary edema in both
 lungs, consistent with congestive heart failure.  There are stable bibasilar
 parenchymal opacities.  Compared to the prior study, the appearance is
 unchanged.

 IMPRESSION:  Stable radiographic appearance of the chest.

 INDICATION: COPD. Status post central line insertion.

 COMPARISON: The radiograph is compared to [**2117-10-9**].

 The ET tube is in situ with its tip approximately 6 cm above the trachea. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. There are generalized
 increased markings present throughout the lung, likely reflecting a
 combination of interstitial thickening with superimposed air space disease.
 Definite left lower lobe collapse/consolidation is identified, with increased
 density projected behind the heart. The left costophrenic sulcus has not been
 evaluated.

 CONCLUSION:

 Definite left basal consolidation present. Generalized increased lung markings
 consistent with COPD.

 INDICATION:  Cardiac arrest, rule/out PE.

 COMPARISON:  There are no prior studies for comparison.

 TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained through
 the chest before and after the administration of Optiray contrast.  Nonionic
 contrast was used for rapid bolus technique.

 CTA CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The pulmonary arteries are
 well- opacified and demonstrate no filling defects to suggest pulmonary
 embolism. The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are unremarkable.  Note is
 made of coronary artery calcifications and wall calcifications in the thoracic
 aorta. There are several small nonpathologically enlarged prevascular,
 mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes.  Note is made of several small calcified
 left hilar lymph nodes. There is no axillary adenopathy.

 The bronchi are patent to the segmental level bilaterally.  There are
 dependent consolidations noted in the lower lobes bilaterally, and in the left
 upper lobe.  There are no pleural effusions.  There is extensive emphysematous
 changes.  Tiny amounts of air are noted within the left subclavian and
 internal mammary veins following contrast injection.  The visualized portions
 of the upper abdomen, including the stomach, liver, and gallbladder are
 unremarkable.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.

 IMPRESSION

 1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
 2.  Dependent consolidations, consistent with aspiration.
 3.  Excessive emphysematous changes.

 INDICATION: S/P intubation for respiratory distress.

 PORTABLE AP CHEST: Comparison is made with the study from 13 hours earlier.
 The ETT has been advanced slightly and is in satisfactory position distal to
 the thoracic inlet. The right internal jugular central venous line tip is
 unchanged in position, within the mid SVC. The NG tube tip is in the proximal
 stomach. Cardiac size is unchanged. Again seen are bilateral parenchymal
 opacities, consistent with pulmonary edema, likely from CHF. There is a small
 left effusion. There are patchy areas of opacity in both lower lobes, which
 could be due to atelectasis, or underlying aspiration/aspiration pneumonia.
 Osseous structures are unchanged.

 IMPRESSION:
 1) Lines  and tubes as above.
 2) Likely worsening left effusion.
 3) Stable pulmonary edema, and bibasilar opacities, which could be due to
 atelectasis, aspiration, or aspiration pneumonia.

 HISTORY:  74-year-old woman status post cardiac arrest with temporary wire
 placement in coronary sinus, now status post extubation.

 AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST, [**2127-8-2**], AT 8:10 P.M.  Comparison is made to
 previous study one day earlier.  The patient has been extubated.  Both ET tube
 and NG tube have been pulled.  The right IJ PA line tip is in the pulmonary
 outflow tract.  There is increasing opacification at the right base, now with
 obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm consistent with probable pleural
 effusion, but atelectasis and/or consolidation cannot be excluded.

 IMPRESSION:  ET tube and NG tube have been pulled.  Increasing density at the
 right base most likely represents pleural fluid, but consolidation and/or
 atelectasis cannot be excluded.  Pleural effusion is unchanged.

 disease.

 COMPARISON:  [**2190-4-27**].

 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The left costophrenic angle is not included on
 this study. Again seen are bilateral patchy opacities consistent with
 pulmonary edema, which appears slightly improved in comparison to prior study.
 Again seen is a right-sided central venous catheter with the tip in the mid
 SVC.  An NG tube is seen extending beyond the inferior margin of the
 radiograph.  An ET tube is seen with the tip positioned approximately 8 cm
 above the carina.  There is apparent overinflation of the cuff.  Soft tissue
 and osseous structures are unchanged.

 IMPRESSION:
 1)  Again seen are bilateral patchy opacities consistent with pulmonary edema
 which appears slightly improved in comparison to the prior study.
 2)  ET tube is seen with the tip positioned at 8 cm above the carina.  There
 is overinflation of the ET tube cuff.

 INDICATION:  A 54-year-old man with _____ time two days, status post _____
 with syncope.  Evaluate for pulmonary embolism.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT imaging of the chest was obtained before and after the
 administration of 100 cc of intravenous Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was
 administered per protocol.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were
 obtained.

 CT ANGIOGRAM CHEST:  A moderately large filling defect is seen within the
 right superior, anterior branch of the pulmonary artery, extending towards the
 right upper lobe.  No additional filling defects are seen within bilateral
 lungs.  Multiple prominent bilateral axillary nodes are seen, which do not
 meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.  Additionally, there is a one-
 centimeter subcarinal lymph node.  Additional lymph nodes are seen within the
 right hilum, which are not significantly enlarged.  Diffuse calcifications are
 seen within the coronary arteries.  The heart, pericardium, and great vessels
 are otherwise unremarkable.  On lung windows, distended consolidation within
 bilateral lungs posteriorly, consistent with pneumonia.  The location of the
 consolidations is most consistent with aspiration pneumonia.  There are no
 pleural effusions bilaterally.  Partial imaging of the abdomen is limited by
 early phase of contrast injection and by the presence of the patient's arms.
 There are no significant abnormalities.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Diffuse degenerative changes are seen along the thoracic spine.
 There are no suspicious lytic or blastic osseous lesions.

 Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the axial findings.  MPR value
 grade II.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderately large pulmonary embolism extending into the superior segment of
 the right pulmonary artery, into the distal branches.
 2.  Bilateral dense, posterior consolidations consistent with aspiration
 pneumonia.
 3.  Dense coronary artery calcifications.
 4.  Prominent bilateral axillary and a single enlarged subcarinal lymph node.
 5.  Generalized edema within the subcutaneous soft tissues.

 INDICATION:  Status post cardiac arrest, intubated, leukocytosis, low-grade
 fever, evaluate for pneumonia and possible aspiration.

 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest obtained with the patient in supine
 position is analyzed in direct comparison with a similar previous study dated
 [**2159-1-14**].  The patient is moderately rotated to the right but
 comparison identifies unchanged position of ET tube in the trachea, Swan-Ganz
 catheter in right pulmonary artery, two pacing electrodes advanced from below
 terminating in the right atrium and right ventricular position
 correspondingly.  Cardiac enlargement persists and again the advanced
 calcifications in the thoracic aorta are noted.  Pulmonary vascular congestive
 pattern has regressed mildly but still central edema pattern remains.  No new

 INDICATION:  Sepsis.

 Endotracheal tube remains in standard position approximately 4 cm above the
 carina.  Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach, but side port is likely
 just above the GE junction level.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  There is minimal perihilar haziness on the right, probably due to
 crowding of pulmonary vasculature, but it is difficult to exclude early
 interstitial edema or minimal peribronchiolar infection.  Attention to this
 region on followup radiographs would be helpful.

 NAME OF PATIENT:  [**Known firstname 324**] [**Known lastname 15810**].

 [**Medical Record Number 52293**].

 DATE OF STUDY:  [**2186-9-12**].

 INDICATIONS:  56 year old man with cardiac arrest and bicycle accident.
 Assessment to rule out fracture requested.

 COMPARISONS:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial noncontrast CT images of the cervical spine were obtained,
 and coronal and sagittal reconstructions were performed. This study was
 initially not identified, or present on the PACS system for viewing,
 resulting in a delay in interpretation.

 FINDINGS:  There is an endotracheal tube passing through the airway, and a
 nasogastric tube passing through the esophagus.  There is a comminuted
 fracture of the C2 vertebral body with loss of height.  The appearance
 suggests an axial loading injury, and the upper fragment is displaced
 inferoposteriorly with some retropulsion into the upper spinal canal.  The
 relationship between the dens and C1 appears preserved, and there is no
 atlanto-occipital subluxation.

 There are multiple fractures through the lateral masses of C2 bilaterally with
 fragmentation of the walls of the transverse foramina. This raises a serious
 conceern of injury to both  vertebral arteries.

 On the right, there is subluxation of the facet joint at C2-3. Also, on the
 left, there is some widening of the facet joint at C2-C3. There is a small
 fracture of the distal spinous process of C3.

 No other evidence of fracture is seen, and the overall alignment of the
 cervical spine is otherwise maintained with some intervertebral disc narrowing
 at C6-C7.

 The soft tissues of the spinal canal are difficult to assess on this study.
 However, given the retropulsion of C2 bone fragments, there is a high risk of
 a hematoma compromising the spinal canal. The possibility of a cord contusion
 cannot be evaluated on this study. At the right lung apex, there is a small
 possible contusion or atelectasis with a tiny effusion.

                                                             (Over)

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Comminuted fracture of C2 with loss of height and retropulsion of bone
 fragments into the spinal canal with bilateral fractures of the lateral masses
 compromising the transverse foramina, and possible dissection of both
 vertebral arteries at this level.
 2.  Fracture of the spinous process of C3.
 3.  No definite evidence of other fracture or subluxations.
 An MRI could be helpful to better evaluate the soft tissues and distinct
 possibility of a hematoma compromising the spinal cord.
 4. Subluxation and widening of the facet joints bilaterally at C2-3.

 not enlarged.  Air in seen within the stomach lumen, likely related to recent
 intubation.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.  Nasogastric tube tip is at the
 gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced for more optimal placement.
 2.  Interstitial pulmonary edema.

 INDICATION:  Cardiac arrest.  Line and tube placement.

 Endotracheal tube has been withdrawn several centimeters now terminating 2.5
 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube terminates in the distal third of the
 esophagus, with tip about 7 cm above the diaphragm.  Swan-Ganz catheter
 terminates in descending portion of left pulmonary artery in the left inferior
 hilar region.  Cardiac silhouette has slightly increased in size, and there is
 no widening of the vascular pedicle.  Bilateral confluent perihilar opacities
 have developed, superimposed upon previously described diffuse bilateral
 septal thickening.  There are slightly more confluent areas of airspace
 consolidation within the dependent posterior segments of both lower lobes
 projecting behind the cardiac contour bilaterally.

 No definite pneumothorax is evident on this supine portable radiograph.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Nasogastric tube terminates above the level of the diaphragm.  Swan-Ganz
 catheter and endotracheal tube, position as detailed above.

 2.  Worsening pulmonary edema.

 HISTORY:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female status post cardiac arrest.  Evaluate for
 aspiration and endotracheal tube placement.

 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:

 FINDINGS: No priors available for comparison.  Today's examination is markedly
 limited by low lung volumes causing crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  The right hemidiaphragm is asymmetrically elevated in comparison
 to the left hemidiaphragm.  There is marked distention of the stomach and
 abdominal bowel likely related to resuscitative effort.  Slightly increased
 spacing between the gastric bubble and the left hemidiaphragm may suggest a
 component of subpulmonic effusion.  There is an ill-defined retrocardiac
 opacity which may reflect atelectasis and/or sequelae of aspiration.
 Endotracheal tube terminates 4.7 cm from the carina.  The aorta is slightly
 ectatic and calcified and there is multilevel degenerative changes of the
 spine.  No pneumothorax or large effusions are identified.

 IMPRESSION:

 1)  Appropriately positioned endotracheal tube.  Gaseous distention of stomach
 and bowel likely related to resuscitative efforts.  NGT may be of benefit.

 2)  Ill-defined retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis and/or sequelae
 from aspiration.

 HISTORY:  Syncope with cardiac arrest.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**2181-7-18**], the elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm is much less pronounced.  Some prominence of interstitial
 markings could reflect chronic pulmonary disease, elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure, or both.  Probable mild atelectatic changes at the bases, but no
 acute focal pneumonia.

 There is now an endotracheal tube in place with its tip about 4.5 cm above the
 carina.  Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach.

 Two views.  Comparison with [**2168-7-23**].  Appears to be further volume loss in the
 right lower lung and the right diaphragm is indistinct.  In addition, there is
 increased hazy density at the right lung base.  The left lung now appears
 essentially clear.  The cardiac silhouette is prominent, as before.  The
 patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  An endotracheal tube and
 nasogastric tube remain in place.  The nasogastric tube is somewhat high, with
 its side hole in the region of the gastroesophageal junction.

 IMPRESSION:  Continued evidence for collapse of the right lower lobe.  Hazy
 density at the right base may be due to accumulation of pleural fluid as well.

 INDICATION:  65-year-old man with coronary artery disease, mesenteric
 ischemia, diarrhea, UTI and sepsis, status post cardiac arrest.

 COMPARISON:  [**2179-9-21**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images of abdomen and pelvis were obtained following
 the administration of oral contrast and 100 cc of Visipaque intravenously.
 Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There are bilateral pleural effusions
 with adjacent compression atelectasis. The patient is status post right
 colectomy.  There is marked colonic wall thickening, most pronounced in the
 proximal transverse colon with surrounding fluid and extensive soft tissue
 stranding.  Wall thickening appears involves the entire colon, consistent with
 a pancolitis. The liver, adrenal glands and spleen are unremarkable.  The
 pancreas is atrophic. There is no evidence of small bowel obstruction.

 There is extensive atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and mesenteric
 vessels with ulcerated plaque present within the aorta. Incidental note made
 of separate origin of common hepatic and splenic arteries from the aorta.
 Infrarenal IVC stent is in place.  SMA appears patent with stent. The patient
 is status post AAA repair. Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach.  The
 patient is status post cholecystectomy.  Again noted is anterior abdominal
 wall soft tissue defect. The fascia appears intact.

 CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Rectum and sigmoid walls are markedly
 thickened, consistent with colitis.  There is a Foley catheter within the
 urinary bladder.  Again noted are aneurysms at the distal anastomosis of the
 aortobifemoral graft, unchanged. There is generalized anasarca.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Demonstrates no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.  Again
 noted are degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar spine.

 HISTORY:  80-year-old man with cardiac arrest.  Evaluate for acute process.

 FINDINGS:  There is a nasogastric tube whose sideport is at the
 gastroesophageal junction and could be advanced several centimeters for more
 optimal placement.  There is a swan ganz catheter entering from a inferior
 approach whose distal tip is likely within the left pulmonary artery. The
 cardiac silhouette is enlarged. There are bilateral pleural effusions and a
 retrocardiac opacity.  There is some lucency seen projecting over the right
 heart border of unclear etiology. There is mild prominence of the pulmonary
 vascular markings.  There is atelectasis at the left mid lung zone.  There is
 a left-sided central venous catheter with distal tip in the mid
 brachiocephalic vein.  No pneumothoraces are identified.

 No comparisons available.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to
 the upper abdomen after administration of 90 cc of Optiray intravenously.  No
 oral contrast was used.

 CTA OF THE CHEST:  No filling defect is noted to suggest pulmonary embolism.
 The soft tissue windows do not demonstrate any pathologically enlarged central
 lymphadenopathy, the largest node is noted within the prevascular space and
 measures 10 mm.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusion is visualized, right
 greater than left, with reactive atelectasis.  Small amount of pericardial
 effusion is visualized. The aorta is severely calcified and calcification of
 the mitral annulus is also visualized.  The coronary arteries also demonstrate
 severe calcification. The tracheostomy tube extends into the right mainstem
 bronchus. Diffuse ground- glass opacities are noted at both lung bases and
 there is diffuse bronchovascular thickening and increased septal marking in
 some areas. There are also more focal areas of consolidative changes in both
 lung apices and the right lower lobe.

 The visualized portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates reflux of the
 contrast into the IVC consistent with cardiac dysfunction. The liver, spleen,
 and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.

   Yesterday, after discussion with the family and patient, decision was
   made to intubate if situation worsens.  The patient requires pressor
   support with phenylephrine.  Overnight, she went back into A fib with
   RVR up to the 140
s.  She was continued on the amiodarone drip.  This
   AM, an ABG was done which was stable showing hypercarbia.  She is
   continued on intermittent BiPap vs. mask ventilation.  She continues to
   be NPO given tenuous respiratory status.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo female with PMH significant for ILD on home O2, diastolic CHF,
   cor pulmonale, s/p liver transplant on immunosuppression,
   post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder s/p CHOP and rituximab
   transferred to ICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   # respiratory distress: hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   Most likely worsening natural course of her ILD with worsening
   pulmonary edema secondary to a fib with RVR.  Patient tenuous at
   baseline. Treating for VAP in addition to underlying lung disease, on
   vanco/zosyn day #[**7-4**]
   - NIPPV, alternate CPAP with face mask
   - serial ABGs. Seems to be stable, If worsening respiratory acidosis,
   will intubate
   - treat SVT as below
   - continue nebulizer treatments
   - No indication for steroids. Has not been responsive to steroids in
   the past
   .
   # SVT: appears to be AF vs MAT on tele and ECG.  The patient was loaded
   with amiodarone drip, started on amiodarone 200mg QD today.  Had
   similar episode on last MICU admission which did not tolerate beta
   blockers and required amio gtt. The patient does not tolerate
   betablockers given hypotensive, thus will attempt to rate control with
   amiodarone only.
   - will continue to monitor on telemetry
   - can attempt bolus IV lopressor if BP will tolerate
   - cont po beta blocker as BP will tolerate
   .
   # hypotension: likely due to RVR, and diastolic heart failure. In the
   setting of low grade fever, must also consider sepsis especially given
   immunosupression . Currently on broad spectrum abx of vanc/zosyn
   - will culture if spikes, follow blood cultures
   - treat SVT as above
   - Will give 1L of NS today, will repeat as tolerated
   - Will continue phenylephrine drip as needed, attempt to wean
   .
   # fever: new low grade temp this am. See hypotension above.  On broad
   spectrum Abs.  Follow culture
   .
   # s/p fall: no evidence of fracture. Pain controlled currently.
   - cont lidocaine patch, tylenol
   - avoid narcotics given tenuous respiratory status
   - PT
   .
   # DM: Even though patient is NPO BG have been very elevated.  Will
   continue to monitor QID and adjust sliding scale accordingly.  Will use
   half dose of outpatient insulin while NPO
   .
   # ILD: unclear etiology. Followed by Pulm. Refractory to steroids.
   - continue supplemental O2
   - no steroids for now
   - alb/atrovent nebs
   .
   # PTLD: no known active issues currently.
   - check LFTs as above
   - continue Tacrolimus at regular dose for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH normal this admission. Continue Levothyroxine
   .
   # Access: PICC, PIV
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now given tenuous respiratory status
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Heparin SC 5000 tid, PPI
   - Bactrim M/W/F
   .
   # Code status: Intubation okay. CPR not indicated.

   # respiratory distress: hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   Patient tenuous at baseline. Acute decompensation seems to have
   occurred in the setting of SVT w/ RVR. No dramatic changes on CXR.

   HPI:
   For complete details, please refer to initial medicine admission note
   and MICU call out note [**2125-12-17**]. In brief, Ms. [**Known lastname 5141**] is a 73 yo
   female with PMH significant for ILD on [**1-27**].5L home O2, diastolic CHF,
   cor pulmonale, s/p liver transplant on immunosuppression,
   post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder s/p CHOP and rituximab who
   was initially admitted to hospital on [**12-10**] after a mechanical fall for
   pain control. On [**12-11**] patient had an aspiration event and hypoxia. The
   following day, she had evidence of aspiration on CXR and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  At that time, goals of care were discussed with
   her HCP, her husband, as well as her daughter and they felt they would
   want intubation.  She was made DNR as it was felt that CPR would not be
   indicated. She was transferred to the MICU.
   .
   In the MICU, she was intubated on [**12-12**] for worsening hypercarbia. That
   evening she spiked a fever, went into AF vs MAT with HRs into the 160s,
   and hypotension to the 80s. She did not tolerate beta blockers at that
   time and was started on an amiodarone gtt.  She was also started on
   empiric vancomycin and zosyn for possible aspiration pna.  She received
   aggressive volume resuscitation and converted to NSR the following
   morning.  Her amiodarone was discontinued given concern for worsening
   lung and liver disease.  Her beta blocker was uptitrated. Antibiotics
   were briefly discontinued on [**12-14**] and restarted on [**12-15**].  She was
   eventually diuresed and was able to be extubated on [**12-16**]. She was
   called out to the medical floor on [**12-17**].
   .
   While on the medical floor, she was continued on vancomycin and zosyn
   for presumed aspiration pna. She had no microbiology data to help guide
   therapy. She was continued on diuretics but has run I/O even per
   documentation. While on floor, SBPOs 100s, HRs 80s, RR 20s, O2 90s on
   3LNC.
   .
   On the evening of transfer, trigger called for increased work of
   breathing. Upon floor evaluation, patient denied any subjective SOB. O2
   requirement the same at 90s n 3LNC and no significant change in RR.
   However, at ~ MN, patient went into irregular SVT (AF vs MAT) to 150s,
   T100.3,  with SBPs into 90s, RR increased to 30s, and O2 sats low 90s
   on 4-6L. She received lopressor 5 mg IV x 2 without significant change
   in her HR and decrease in SBP to 80s. CXR repeated without significant
   change compared to this am. ABG showed 7.35/73/54.

   Admitted [**12-10**] with resp failure, intubated in MICU [**2038-12-11**], treated
   with Abx (no steroids), transferred to floor on [**12-17**]. Triggered today
   for low grade fever 100.3,  tachycardia to 150s, hypoxia on pO2 53 on 6
   liters O2. BP dropped following lopressor, transferred to MICU, put on

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo female with PMH significant for ILD on home O2, diastolic CHF,
   cor pulmonale, s/p liver transplant on immunosuppression,
   post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder s/p CHOP and rituximab
   transferred to ICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   # respiratory distress: hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   Most likely worsening natural course of her ILD with worsening
   pulmonary edema secondary to a fib with RVR.  Patient tenuous at
   baseline. Treating for VAP in addition to underlying lung disease, on
   vanco/zosyn day #[**7-4**]
   - NIPPV, alternate CPAP with face mask
   - serial ABGs. Seems to be stable, If worsening respiratory acidosis,
   will intubate
   - treat SVT as below
   - continue nebulizer treatments
   - No indication for steroids. Has not been responsive to steroids in
   the past
   .
   # SVT: appears to be AF vs MAT on tele and ECG.  The patient was loaded
   with amiodarone drip, started on amiodarone 200mg QD today.  Had
   similar episode on last MICU admission which did not tolerate beta
   blockers and required amio gtt. The patient does not tolerate
   betablockers given hypotensive, thus will attempt to rate control with
   amiodarone only.
   - will continue to monitor on telemetry
   - can attempt bolus IV lopressor if BP will tolerate
   - cont po beta blocker as BP will tolerate
   .
   # hypotension: likely due to RVR, and diastolic heart failure. In the
   setting of low grade fever, must also consider sepsis especially given
   immunosupression . Currently on broad spectrum abx of vanc/zosyn
   - will culture if spikes, follow blood cultures
   - treat SVT as above
   - Will give 1L of NS today, will repeat as tolerated
   - Will continue phenylephrine drip as needed, attempt to wean
   .
   # fever: new low grade temp this am. See hypotension above.  On broad
   spectrum Abs.  Follow culture
   .
   # s/p fall: no evidence of fracture. Pain controlled currently.
   - cont lidocaine patch, tylenol
   - avoid narcotics given tenuous respiratory status
   - PT
   .
   # DM: Even though patient is NPO BG have been very elevated.  Will
   continue to monitor QID and adjust sliding scale accordingly.  Will use
   half dose of outpatient insulin while NPO
   .
   # ILD: unclear etiology. Followed by Pulm. Refractory to steroids.
   - continue supplemental O2
   - no steroids for now
   - alb/atrovent nebs
   .
   # PTLD: no known active issues currently.
   - check LFTs as above
   - continue Tacrolimus at regular dose for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH normal this admission. Continue Levothyroxine
   .
   # Access: PICC, PIV
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now given tenuous respiratory status
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Heparin SC 5000 tid, PPI
   - Bactrim M/W/F

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 73 yo woman w/ h/o fibrotic ILD of unknown
   etiology recently off steroids, s/p liver transplant s/p PTLD on
   immunosuppression, h/o AF, DM, recent admit [**12-10**] w/mechanical fall f/b
   aspiration in ICU for hypercarbic resp failure w/short term intubation
   c/b AF, hypotension, transiently on amio.  Extubated [**12-16**], to medical
   floor on [**12-17**] awaiting rehab.  Triggered [**12-21**] for increased work of
   breathing, but felt at baseline.  Midnight tachy to 150
s w/AF vs MAT,
   hypotension to 70
s, new O2 requirement w/ ABG on 6L 7.35/73/54.
   Treated with biPAP for respiratory distress.  Reassessed code status
   and wished to be in ICU and have full care.  Started on amio drip and
   bolus, Neo thru PICC for hypotension.  Repeat 7.35/67/386 on BiPAP.  No
   obvious significant infection despite low grade fever, added cipro to
   cover. Converted to NSR after coming off BiPAP 12/27.  Returned to AF
   w/RVR at 110
s last night
 appears dyspneic, but does not report
   dyspnea.  Restarted amio drip and oral amio.  Rediscussion of code
   status and pt wishes to be reintubated if need be.
   Awake and alert this AM
 mild respiratory distress.  Exam notable for
   Tm 100 BP 90/70 HR 76 (NSR) to 136 (AF) RR 20 with sat 97 on 2L.
   7.25/74/141 Appears cushingoid, crackles at bases, obese abdomen, lower
   extremity 1+ edema . Labs notable for WBC 16.9K, HCT 25, Na 125 (from
   135), Gluc 379, K+ 4, Cr 1.4. LFTs wnl. CXR with low lung volumes no
   obvious infiltrates.
   Agree with plan that respiratory and hemodynamic compromise likely due
   to underlying ILD with superimposed atrial fibrillation.  AF has
   recurred and we have restarted amiodarone.  Continue pressor to
   maintain perfusion pressure.  Respiratory status remains tenuous and
   will likely need intermittent periods of BiPAP.  Will continue
   Vanco/Zosyn and hold cipro awaiting cultures.  Continue tacrolimus for
   s/p liver transplant.  No new therapy for lung disease.  Continue
   discussions with family, primary care physician and consultants for
   overall plan of care. Unable to advance diet.  Remainder of plan as
   outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

 PORTABLE CHEST, [**2169-6-22**]

 COMPARISON:  Previous study of earlier the same day.

 INDICATION:  PICC line placement.

 Right PICC line makes an upward turn at the expected junction of the right
 subclavian and right internal jugular veins, there is also some apparent
 redundancy in the catheter in the right axillary region.  The position of the
 catheter has been discussed by telephone with [**Doctor First Name 2304**], venous access nurse, on
 [**2169-6-22**].

 Other indwelling devices are unchanged.  Perihilar edema persists.
 Additionally, right basilar opacity has progressed, and may be due to
 dependent edema or a secondary process such as evolving infection.  Attention
 to this area on a followup radiograph would be helpful, if warranted
 clinically.

 HEAD CT

 HISTORY:  72-year-old male with cardiac arrest and prolonged CPR.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous 5-mm axial images were obtained from the skull base to
 the vertex.

 FINDINGS:  No comparisons are available.

 There are no intracranial hemorrhages or masses.  The [**Doctor Last Name 181**]/white matter
 differentiation is maintained.  There are scattered periventricular and deep
 white matter hypodensities consistent with small vessel ischemic changes.
 There is a small hypodensity of the right middle cerebellar peduncle/inferior
 cerebellum which may represent an old lacunar infarct.

 There is prominence of the ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces which likely
 represent atrophy.  There are diffuse vascular calcifications of the
 intracranial, vertebrobasilar and internal carotid arteries.

 There is an endotracheal tube and an orogastric tube in place.  Fluid is seen
 within the nasal and oropharynx.  Mild mucosal thickening of the right
 maxillary sinus and the sphenoid sinuses bilaterally are noted.  There is a
 0.8-cm osteoma in the left frontal sinus.  No suspicious bony abnormalities
 are seen.

 IMPRESSION:

 Small vessel ischemic changes and lacune of the right inferior cerebellum.  If
 there is strong concern for an acute infarct or hypoxic injury, recommend
 further evaluation with MRI.  The above findings and recommendations were
 discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1238**] immediately after the completion of the study.

   [**11-20**] surrounding the time of CT Abd with contrast. LMS on CT also
   obliterated with secretions at this time. Resp failure likely [**3-17**] mucus
   plug vs. pneumonia (MRSA sputum). lIntubated morning of [**11-21**]. ABG have
   improved with good O2 sats on PS5 PEEP 5. Most recent RSBI 53. He will
   likely tolerate extubation given iomprovement in secretions last 24
   hours. He has not coughed much but seems like he would have adequate
   cough.
   - Extubate as tolerate
   - Treat PNA with Linezolid
   - NAC nebs and mucinex with chest PT for clearance of secretions

"380",1513,29299,"Chief Complaint:  perforated cecum / intradominal abscess
   HPI:
   The pt. is 55yoM with hx of morbid obesity, type II DM, OSA on BiPAP,
   with a very complicated 2 month hospital course s/p Cardiac Arrest on
   [**11-21**] transferred to the unit for MRSA HAP.
   Pt initially presented on [**9-13**] due with acute change in MS, weakness on
   his RLE weakness extremity found to have bilateral thalamic, and L
   cerebral peduncle infarcts, transferred to the floor for 2 week course
   with continued FUO and discharged to rehab. Pt re-admitted on [**10-14**] and
   found to have with intra-peritoneal air and abdominal pain taken to the
   OR and found to have perforated Cecum secondary thought to be secondary
   to [**Last Name (un) **] syndrome, then s/p right colectomy and end ileostomy with
   Hartmann's patch.
   His post-op course was complicated by abdominal abscess. The pt
   developed purulence at his op site and wound was opened and cultured.
   He was started on Vancomycin on [**10-23**]. Cultures grew MRSA and VRE. CT abd
   showed large fluid collection. He was intubated on [**10-28**] for inability
   to manage airway secretions and was started on zosyn. CT abd on [**10-30**]
   again showed an organizing fluid collection R hepatic flex to pelvis
   and on [**10-31**] the collection was drained. Fluid grew VRE on [**10-31**]. He was
   continued on Vanco/Zosyn until [**11-5**]. He also had sputum cultures on
   [**10-27**] and [**10-28**] with MRSA. In addition CT scan [**2192-11-6**] to evaluate his
   fluid collections showed an SMV clot. Hematology was consulted and
   hypercoag labs were sent and found to have Factor 5 Leiden. Patient was
   started on Coumadin.
   On [**11-20**] pt had CT abd w/ PO contrast via Dobhoff tube for re-eval of
   abdominal abscess/leak that was drained by a pigtail. Overnight pt
   triggered for tachypnia and subsequently transferred from East to [**Hospital Ward Name **] to the TICU. On arrival to the TICU the pt was in respiratory
   distress. He was emergently intubated. Following intubation he suffered
   a cardiac arrest with pulseless VT responding to epi X3. Down time
   estimated at 5 minutes. He underwent a bronchoscopy on [**11-21**] with
   cultures growing coag + staph. He was started on Vancomycin and
   Levaquin. Pt now transferred to the MICU for further medical
   management.
   Pt was admitted to MICU [**Location (un) **], following transfer from TICU during
   which he suffered a cardiac arrest. The pt was intubated and sedated on
   arrival for Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure thought to be secondary
   to mucous plugging. The patient was weaned off the vent over the course
   of his first day and was subsequently extubated without complications.
   The pt was placed on scoop mask and subsequently transferred to the
   floor with a 2-3L O2 requirement.
   The patient was transferred to the floor on [**11-26**] during which time his
   mental status began to clear. He had been intermittently oriented to
   [**2192-11-14**] and could discuss the [**Company 6144**]. He received multiple
   debridements of a sacral ulcer that had been present since his original
   surgery. A wound culture from [**11-27**] grew e.coli and enterococcus and
   Zosyn was added to his regimen on [**11-30**]. Of note, his percutaneous
   drainage tube was removed on [**12-1**] after multiple days of <5cc
   drainage. On [**12-2**], the patient developed fevers to 100-101. Standard
   infectious work up was negative with unchanged CXR, negative blood
   cultures, and U/A with only yeast. ID was consulted and Zosyn was
   changed to Meropenem out of concern for drug fever on [**12-3**]. However,
   the patient continued to have fevers. The evening of [**12-5**], the patient
   had an episode of tachypnea to the 30s without new hypoxia or acidosis
   on ABG, which resolved by morning. Today he was sent for a repeat CT
   Torso to evaluate for potential worsening of his abscess. This showed a
   large and worsened phlegmon at the site of the previous pigtail with a
   new fluid collection. Upon returning from CT, he was tachycardic to the
   130s-140s (sinus) and tachypnic with worsened abdominal pain. Surgery
   was called but felt his abdomen did not require surgical intervention.
   He received 1L NS and 10mg PO coumadin for a potential IR drainage
   procedure in the am. He denied chest pain, worsened SOB, N/V. He was
   not hypotensive and an ABG confirmed the lack of acidosis.

"381",1513,29299,"Chief Complaint:  perforated cecum / intradominal abscess
   HPI:
   The pt. is 55yoM with hx of morbid obesity, type II DM, OSA on BiPAP,
   with a very complicated 2 month hospital course s/p Cardiac Arrest on
   [**11-21**] transferred to the unit for MRSA HAP.
   Pt initially presented on [**9-13**] due with acute change in MS, weakness on
   his RLE weakness extremity found to have bilateral thalamic, and L
   cerebral peduncle infarcts, transferred to the floor for 2 week course
   with continued FUO and discharged to rehab. Pt re-admitted on [**10-14**] and
   found to have with intra-peritoneal air and abdominal pain taken to the
   OR and found to have perforated Cecum secondary thought to be secondary
   to [**Last Name (un) **] syndrome, then s/p right colectomy and end ileostomy with
   Hartmann's patch.
   His post-op course was complicated by abdominal abscess. The pt
   developed purulence at his op site and wound was opened and cultured.
   He was started on Vancomycin on [**10-23**]. Cultures grew MRSA and VRE. CT abd
   showed large fluid collection. He was intubated on [**10-28**] for inability
   to manage airway secretions and was started on zosyn. CT abd on [**10-30**]
   again showed an organizing fluid collection R hepatic flex to pelvis
   and on [**10-31**] the collection was drained. Fluid grew VRE on [**10-31**]. He was
   continued on Vanco/Zosyn until [**11-5**]. He also had sputum cultures on
   [**10-27**] and [**10-28**] with MRSA. In addition CT scan [**2192-11-6**] to evaluate his
   fluid collections showed an SMV clot. Hematology was consulted and
   hypercoag labs were sent and found to have Factor 5 Leiden. Patient was
   started on Coumadin.
   On [**11-20**] pt had CT abd w/ PO contrast via Dobhoff tube for re-eval of
   abdominal abscess/leak that was drained by a pigtail. Overnight pt
   triggered for tachypnia and subsequently transferred from East to [**Hospital Ward Name **] to the TICU. On arrival to the TICU the pt was in respiratory
   distress. He was emergently intubated. Following intubation he suffered
   a cardiac arrest with pulseless VT responding to epi X3. Down time
   estimated at 5 minutes. He underwent a bronchoscopy on [**11-21**] with
   cultures growing coag + staph. He was started on Vancomycin and
   Levaquin. Pt now transferred to the MICU for further medical
   management.
   Pt was admitted to MICU [**Location (un) **], following transfer from TICU during
   which he suffered a cardiac arrest. The pt was intubated and sedated on
   arrival for Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure thought to be secondary
   to mucous plugging. The patient was weaned off the vent over the course
   of his first day and was subsequently extubated without complications.
   The pt was placed on scoop mask and subsequently transferred to the
   floor with a 2-3L O2 requirement.
   The patient was transferred to the floor on [**11-26**] during which time his
   mental status began to clear. He had been intermittently oriented to
   [**2192-11-14**] and could discuss the [**Company 6144**]. He received multiple
   debridements of a sacral ulcer that had been present since his original
   surgery. A wound culture from [**11-27**] grew e.coli and enterococcus and
   Zosyn was added to his regimen on [**11-30**]. Of note, his percutaneous
   drainage tube was removed on [**12-1**] after multiple days of <5cc
   drainage. On [**12-2**], the patient developed fevers to 100-101. Standard
   infectious work up was negative with unchanged CXR, negative blood
   cultures, and U/A with only yeast. ID was consulted and Zosyn was
   changed to Meropenem out of concern for drug fever on [**12-3**]. However,
   the patient continued to have fevers. The evening of [**12-5**], the patient
   had an episode of tachypnea to the 30s without new hypoxia or acidosis
   on ABG, which resolved by morning. Today he was sent for a repeat CT
   Torso to evaluate for potential worsening of his abscess. This showed a
   large and worsened phlegmon at the site of the previous pigtail with a
   new fluid collection. Upon returning from CT, he was tachycardic to the
   130s-140s (sinus) and tachypnic with worsened abdominal pain. Surgery
   was called but felt his abdomen did not require surgical intervention.
   He received 1L NS and 10mg PO Vitamin K for an IR drainage on [**2192-12-7**],
   that of which he tolerated well.
   He was transferred to MICU 785 from the CCU to maintain geographic
   continuity with ICU attendings.  Upon arrival the patient reports that
   he has some abdominal pain, but is otherwise
.  He reports that the
   IR guided drainage of the phlegmon went well.  He is accompanied by his
   sister, [**Name (NI) **].

    Fevers/Tachypnea/Tachycardia
 Patient initially brought to the CCU
   with fever, tachypnea and tachycardia thought to be due to worsening
   abdominal abscess.  Other considerations include ventral wound,
   pneumonia, or UTI.  Ventral wound looks clean and ostomy appears

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided. I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5951**]
s note above and I
   agree with the findings and plan of care.  I would add that Mr [**Known lastname 3971**]
   has been successfully extubated, but with the help of intensive
   pulmonary hygiene efforts he is coughing up purulent sputum which will
   be cultured today.  We will try to keep him hydrated to improve mucus
   viscosity.  He is awake and  alert but confused, which is far different
   from his post CVA baseline.  This is likely due to his CNS anoxia from
   his arrest, his infections, and his episode of  hypoglycemia and
   hypotension last night.  We will attempt to smooth out glucose control
   and keep his BP and Sats stable, but it may take time for his mentation
   to significantly improve.  For now he needs ICU level of care.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5951**]
s note above and
   agree with the findings and plan of care.  I would add the following:
   Mr [**Known lastname 3971**] continues to hold his own from a respiratory standpoint,
   coughing well and raising sputum with is growing, not surprisingly
   MRSA.  This MRSA bronchitis continues to be treated with Linezolid.
   His TFs will today be up to full, and we will ask [**Last Name (un) 276**] to assist us
   in the control of this brittle diabetic
s glucoses.  For now we will
   continue NG feedings
   He still has a dense right hemiplegia.  He remains alert, and seems
   less confused than yesterday, but is still quite far off the mark from
   what his sister says is his recent post CVA baseline. I suspect this is
   due to his recent anoxic event, ongoing infection, and wide swings in
   his BS
   His sacral decubitus may well be to the point of causing sacral
   osteomyelitis.  We will ask Plastic Surgery to advise us on what
   further can be done for this.
   We appreciate surgery service following the pt with us and advising
   when to d/c abdominal drain.
   All in all, patient is stable and able to be cared for on the floor.

   unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic
   function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this this day I examined the patient and was present for the key
   portions of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5809**]
s note
   and agree with the findings and plan of care. I would only add or
   emphasize the following:  The patient was intubated in the setting of a
   cardiac arrest , presumably from hypoxia from mucus plugging.  He has
   been titrated down to minimal ventilatory support and has a clear CXR
   and good RSBI, such that we believe he should be given the chance at
   extubation.  He will need to be followed closely for pulmonary hygiene,
   encouraged to cough, and given mucolytics. His prior stroke may be
   contributing to his less than optimal ability to clear his secretions.
   He is on Linezolid  for a MRSA pneumonia, VRE UTI, and VRE abdominal
   wall abscess.

   HPI:
   HPI: The pt. is 55yoM with hx of morbid obesity, type II DM, OSA on
   BiPAP, with a very complicated 2 month hospital course s/p Cardiac
   Arrest on [**11-21**] transferred to the unit for MRSA HAP.
   .
   Pt initially presented on [**9-13**] due with acute change in MS, weakness on
   his RLE weakness extremity found to have bilateral thalamic, and L
   cerebral peduncle infarcts, transferred to the floor for 2 week course
   with continued FUO and discharged to rehab. Pt re-admitted on [**10-14**] and
   found to have with intra-peritoneal air and abdominal pain taken to the
   OR and found to have perforated Cecum secondary thought to be secondary
   to [**Last Name (un) **] syndrome, then s/p right colectomy and end ileostomy with
   Hartmann's patch.
   .
   His post-op course was complicated by abdominal abscess. The pt
   developed purulence at his op site and wound was opened and cultured.
   He was started on Vancomycin on [**10-23**]. Cultures grew MRSA and VRE. CT abd
   showed large fluid collection. He was intubated on [**10-28**] for inability
   to manage airway secretions and was started on zosyn. CT abd on [**10-30**]
   again showed an organizing fluid collection R hepatic flex to pelvis
   and on [**10-31**] the collection was drained. Fluid grew VRE on [**10-31**].  He was
   continued on Vanco/Zosyn until [**11-5**]. He also had sputum cultures on
   [**10-27**] and [**10-28**] with MRSA. In addition CT scan [**2192-11-6**] to evaluate his
   fluid collections showed an SMV clot. Hematology was consulted and
   hypercoag labs were sent and found to have Factor 5 Leiden. Patient has
   been therapeutic on coumadin for past week.
   .
   On [**11-20**] pt had CT abd w/ PO contrast via Dobhoff tube for re-eval of
   abdominal abscess/leak that was drained by a pigtail. Overnight pt
   triggered for tachypnia and subsequently transferred from East to [**Hospital Ward Name **] to the TICU. On arrival to the TICU the pt was in respiratory
   distress. He was emergently intubated. Following intubation he suffered
   a cardiac arrest with pulseless VT responding to epi X3. Down time
   estimated at 5 minutes. He underwent a bronchoscopy on [**11-21**] with
   cultures growing coag + staph. He was started on Vancomycin and
   Levaquin. Pt now transferred to the MICU for further medical
   management.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): DLnc SUN [**2192-11-25**] 10:33 PM
  The patient is extubated.  Slight worsening of the opacities in the left and
  right base which might represent atelectasis related to termination of
  mechanical ventilation.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of a patient after cardiac arrest and with
 decreased blood pressure.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to prior study obtained the same day
 earlier at 04:21 a.m.

 The patient was extubated in the meantime interval.  The Dobbhoff tube tip is
 in the proximal stomach.  The right internal jugular line tip is in mid SVC.
 No changes in the cardiomediastinal contour were demonstrated.  There are
 slightly more opacities in the left lower lung which might represent a new
 area of atelectasis/aspiration.  Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
 The left costophrenic angle is excluded from the study, precluding assessment
 of the left base and pleural costophrenic sulcus.

   ECHO: Very limited image quality. The left atrium is dilated. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
   unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic
   function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. There
   is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are not well seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is
   an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

 INDICATION:  Abdominal pain, intubation.

 COMPARISON:  [**2117-10-6**].

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the tube position has been
 changed.  The tip of the endotracheal tube now projects 3 cm above the carina.
 Resolution of the near total left hemithorax opacity.  Remnant atelectasis at
 the left lung base and remnant opacity at the left lung apex.  No newly
 occurred focal parenchymal opacities in the right lung.  The size of the
 cardiac silhouette is moderately increased.  Minimal peribronchial cuffing
 might suggest mild interstitial fluid accumulation.

   Tests
   ECG: EKG:  atrial fibrillation at 53, with bigeminy, normal axis, no
   LVH, no evidence of ischemia.
   Echocardiogram: (Date: [**2117-1-5**]), The left atrium is mildly dilated.
   The right atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial
   pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
   left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
   aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
   valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**2-12**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A mitral valve
   annuloplasty ring is present. The mitral annular ring appears well
   seated and is not obstructing flow. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Significant
   pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-10-5**], findings
   are similar. Tricuspid regurgitation gradient is now lower.
   Cardiac Cath: (Date: [**2116-5-20**]), 1.  Coronary angiography in this
   right-dominant system revealed
   two-vessel coronary artery disease:
   --the LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
   --the LAD had a 40% stenosis in its mid portion
   --the LCX had a long 60% proximal stenosis, and an 80% distal stenosis.
   --the RCA had a 70% proximal stenosis, 50% mid stenosis, and 60% distal
   stenosis.
   2.  Left ventriculography revealed a measured LVEF of 49% with severe
   3+
   mitral regurgitation into a very large left atrium.
   3.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided
   filling
   pressures with RVEDP 13 mmHg and LVEDP 26 mmHg.  There was moderate
   pulmonary hypertension with PASP 50 mmHg. The PCWP was elevated at 26
   mmHg.  There was moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension, with
   SBP 158 mmHg.  There was no gradient across the aortic valve upon
   pullback of the angled pigtail catheter from LV to ascending aorta.
   The
   cardiac output was depressed, with cardiac index 1.6 L/min/m2.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1.  Two-vessel coronary artery disease.
   2.  Severe mitral regurgitation, with elevated filling pressures.

 INDICATION:  78-year-old female admitted to CCU after asystole.

 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable AP chest x-ray.

 COMPARISON:  Portable chest x-ray from [**2117-10-6**] and chest CT from
 [**2117-10-7**].

 FINDINGS:  The residual left upper lobe atelectasis is further improving.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila are normal.  There is no pleural
 pathology.  The patient is status post mitral valve replacement.  The sternal
 wires are intact and aligned.  An endotracheal tube ends 4 cm above the
 carina.  Orogastric tube passes beyond the GE junction and passes the gastric
 cardia, its tip cannot be visualized.

 IMPRESSION:  Orogastric tube travels beyond the GE junction into the gastric
 cardia, the tip is not in the field of view of this chest x-ray.  Left upper
 lobe atelectasis further improving.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  76-year-old man with cardiac arrest, query right heart strain,
 evaluate for PE.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest of [**2165-3-14**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the chest after
 the administration of 100 cc of intravenous contrast material.  Given the
 patient's elevated creatinine, the use of intravenous contrast material was
 discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 58725**] [**Name (STitle) 56132**].  Pre-examination hydration with
 intravenous bicarbonate, as well as post-examination dialysis within 24 hours
 was recommended.  Multiplanar reformatted images were also obtained.

 FINDINGS:  The pulmonary arterial tree is well opacified, and there is no
 pulmonary embolism.  There are no acute aortic abnormalities.  However, severe
 atherosclerotic disease is seen within the aorta, with a large amount of
 calcified plaque along the entire descending thoracic aorta.  This has a
 similar appearance to the previous study of [**2165-2-21**].

 The heart appears unremarkable, with no right-sided cardiac enlargement or
 reflux of contrast material into the inferior vena cava. In the lungs,
 thickening of the interlobular septa indicates mild pulmonary edema. Bilateral
 pleural effusions with associated dependent atelectasis are also seen.
 Additionally, patchy airspace opacity is seen at the left lung base, which may
 represent a small amount of aspiration.  The tracheobronchial tree contains an
 endotracheal tube, and is otherwise unremarkable to the subsegmental levels. A
 tiny, sub-4-mm nodule is seen in the right lower lobe (3:54).  In the absence
 of risk factors for lung cancer, no followup is needed.  An NG tube is seen in
 the esophagus and terminates in the stomach.

 While this examination is not optimized for evaluation of the abdomen, limited
 images of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.

 Examination of osseous structures reveals mild degenerative disease of the
 thoracic spine.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pulmonary embolism.  No acute aortic abnormalities identified.
 2.  Severe atherosclerotic disease of the aorta, with calcified plaque along
                                                             (Over)

 INDICATION:  Status post sudden cardiac arrest.  Evaluate for cardiopulmonary
 process.

 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright chest radiograph was performed, without
 comparisons.

 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated, with endotracheal tube approximately 3 cm
 above the carina.  Several surgical clips are seen projecting over the left
 neck.  There is retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms and more subtle
 air bronchograms on the right. Similarly, there are also diffuse alveolar
 opacities seen throughout both the right and left lungs, probably slightly
 worse on the right than on the left, with appearances suggesting pulmonary
 edema.  No evidence of pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bilateral alveolar opacities, more on the right than left, likely
 pulmonary edema.

 2.  Retrocardiac opacity, with air bronchograms, consistent with
 consolidation.  Subtle bronchograms on the right may be associated with
 consolidation as well.

 INDICATION:  60-year-old man with acute cardiac arrest, intubated,
 nonresponsive.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images through the chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV
 contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted views were displayed.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are diffuse bilateral patchy ground-
 glass opacities. Airspace consolidations in the dependent portions of both
 lower lobes are seen. An endotracheal tube is noted with its tip at 3 cm above
 the carina. Dense calcifications of the coronary arteries are noted.
 The heart is enlarged.  The aorta is normal in size with minimal
 calcifications without evidence of dissection or aneurysm.  The pulmonary
 artery is normal in size, patent, without filling defects to suggest pulmonary
 embolism.  No pneumothorax, pleural or pericardial effusions.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a 4.6 x 4.5 cm hypodense lesion
 within segment VI that demonstrates arterial slightly heterogeneous
 enhancement and fills in on delayed images. The gallbladder is normal without
 evidence of radiopaque gallstones. There is no intra or extra- hepatic biliary
 ductal dilatation. The spleen and pancreas are unremarkable. The kidneys
 demonstrate symmetrical enhancement without hydronephrosis. Multiple small
 cortical hypodensities within the right kidney, too small to be fully
 characterized. The left kidney demonstrates a simple cyst in the upper pole
 measuring 1.9 x 2.2 cm. In addition, there is a 1.7 x 1.2 cm  cyst in the
 midpole. Multiple tiny cortical hypodensities are also seen within the left
 kidney, too small to be fully characterized.  The adrenal glands are normal.
 There is no evidence of free air or free fluid within the abdomen.  A large
 ventral hernia is noted containing loops of small and large bowel.  The
 stomach is distended with an NG tube within.  There are mildly distended
 proximal loops of small bowel measuring up to 4 cm in diameter. There is no
 evidence of free air.  The cecum is dilated measuring up to 7.6 cm in
 diameter.  Small mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, not
 pathologically enlarged by CT criteria.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid, distal ureters are
 normal.  The prostate is mildly enlarged.  A Foley catheter is seen within the
                                                             (Over)

 bladder which is not distended.  No free fluid is seen within the pelvis. Fat-
 containing right inguinal hernia is noted.  Streak artifact from a right total
 hip arthroplasty obscures the right pelvis.  There is a 1.7 cm rounded
 calcification within the pelvis likely representing a calcified mesenteric
 lymph node.

 BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified. Severe
 degenerative changes of the thoracic and lumbar spine.  Grade I
 anterolisthesis of L5-S1.  Anterior wedge deformity of L1.  Fusion of the
 anterior aspect of T10, 11, and 12.  Severe degenerative changes of the right
 hip.  Right total hip arthroplasty. There is artifact from breathing causing
 double contour of the sternum. Severe and extensive calcifications of the
 aorta.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of PE.
 2.  Cardiomegaly.
 3.  Airspace consolidation in the dependent portions of both lower lobes
 likely represents aspiration pneumonia.
 4. 4.5 x 4.4 cm right liver lobe hypodense lesion with contrast enhancement
 not fully characterized but may represent hemangioma. Follow up MRI is
 recommended when feasible.
 5. Left renal cyst and multiple renal lesions that are too small to
 characterize but likely also represent cysts.
 6. Large ventral hernia containing loops of small and large bowel.  There is
 mild proximal small bowel dilatation, no definite transition point is seen.

O: This 66y old male with long PMH including IDDM, hypercoagulable syndrone with ischemic colitis requireing multiple resections with only 15% nl bowel left. At times on TPN. R BKA c/b multiple infections. Uses prosthesis. Afib with nodal ablation and pacemaker. Sever periferal neuropathiy. Chronic low back pain. stroke in 99 with residual l weakness. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 4580**] [**Doctor First Name 196**] . Anal fissure. He comes in today with increasing weakness and failure to thrive. On arrival in EW he was in stable VT at 160. Shortly after starting amiodarone bolus he passed out and was cardioverted with 200j into paced rhythm. The amiodarone bolus was completed but he was changed to lidocaine 1mg/min. He was hypotensive to the 70s and neosynephrine was started at .1mic/kilo with bp up to 90-low 100s. A triple lumen was inserted in his R IJ.  His WBC were elevated to 34.7. He was cultured and vanco hung. He also received 3 liters NS and was transfered to CCU hemodynamically stable and A & O X 3.
ID: PT initially hypothermic and bare hugger was applied. WBC up to 44. He was also started on zosyn. Second blood cultures sent.
CV: Pt remains on lidocaine at 1mg and neosynephrine at .1mic/kilo. BP has remained 90-110/40-50s. Aline inserted. HR initially 70s v paced with frequent PVCs. By 1800 he had rare PVCs. The distal port of triple lumen is being transduced and CVP is being recorded as 24-28. However the tracing is poor and it is unclear if this is an accurate number as his neck veins are not up and he does not sound wet. His venous sat is 58. He is now receiving a 4th liter of NS. His troponin is .12.
RESP: Pt has no c/o of dyspea. RR 18-22. Some faint rales heard at the bases. He is sating 95-98% on 5L NP. His gas shows uncompensated metabolic acidosis: 7.19/ 37/89/ 15.
GI: Pt initially not hungry, but is so now. We are having him eat minimal diet this evening until we are sure of his stability. He wears diaper due to occasional fecal incontinence.
RENAL: He refuses foley catheter. He needs to sit on the side of the bed to void and voided 300cc. Samples sent.
ENDO: Finger stick was 242 and he received 4U reg insulin. He will received NPH tonight.
SKIN: He has no obvious areas of breakdown. Skin is very dry and needs lubication.
MS/COMFORT: A & O X 3. He has neuropathies and chronic back pain. He was having stump pain which resolved with raising it on a pillow. He received 1 percocette with moderate, acceptable pain control. His wife who is his proxy is here with him.

Social service consulted regarding this.

Today pt had unstable BP this Am requiring fluid bolus 500 cc x 2
at 0730 am and 0830 am, and again later in day. Pt is preload dependent. She was on 10 MCG/KG/MIN of Dopamine but was able to wean down somewhat in the afternoon. PT Hypotensive to 70's or less when dopa off for bag change, unsure what causing hypotension but family states that baseline BP is on the low side.  IT would appear she has adequate cardiac output as she is making plety of urine.  Pulses have improved over course of day. Sedation was weaned off in the AM then restarted for chest/rib/belly pain ( team updated) . Pt woke up moves all extremities, to command, nods to questions cooperative. Right FEM venous introducer was dc'd today at 1400 and we re weaned her sedation at that time in atempt to extubate. At 4 PM we sat her up and placed her on 5 peep 5 PS no rate, and she did OK for a while but would fall asleep and become apneic. We attempted again at 5:10 PM and pt is breathing on her own, RR 14-16 will monitor.

We are following HCT, cpk and lytes, K was repleated this afternoon 40 kcl in 500 cc over 4 hours ( finish at 8 Pm), 2 grams of mag was given. Pt had coffee grounds and some blood coming from NGT, irrigated to clear in am but blood tinge returned, we are following HCT next one due at 1900, CPK have peaked. HCT has dropped from 38-39 to 34.5 spoke with CCU resident we will continue monitor but two unitsPRBC's are typed and crossed and waiting if she needs blood.

Respiratory wise we have been following her O2 sats, she has no A line, and she denies SOB. Her lungs sound clear, and we suctioned her for zero secreations. Curently she is on 5 peep and 10 PSV, she is breathing 14-16 her sat is 99 percent and she is watching the baseball game.

A: Pt S/P VFib arrest, RV infarct, requires fluids and pressors, Neuro intact, respiratory wise stable and ? may be extubated this afternoon.

p: Follow HCT, lytes, PTT ( PTT has gone up despite decreasing doses, heparin, discussed with team and we are checking PTT with PM labs dose at 400 units per hour) ? extubate, pt looks good to go RISBI- 23.

 COMPARISON:  [**2149-7-8**].

 INDICATION:  Cardiac arrest.  Intubated.

 Swan-Ganz catheter projects distal to the right hilar contour, likely within a
 proximal segmental vessel of the right middle or lower lobe.  Right PICC line
 courses medially within the left brachiocephalic vein with distal tip at the
 junction of the left brachiocephalic vein and left subclavian vein.

 Endotracheal tube tip is not well demonstrated, but has been better visualized
 on the subsequent radiograph performed 2215 (dictated under clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) 84037**]).
 Temporary pacing lead terminates in right ventricle and nasogastric tube
 courses below the diaphragm to terminate in the distal stomach near the
 junction with the duodenum.

 Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and pulmonary vascularity is engorged.
 Bilateral combined alveolar and interstitial pattern, worse on the left than
 the right probably reflects pulmonary edema.  Small pleural effusions are
 present as well as preexisting right-sided pleural thickening.

 Position of lines and tubes was discussed by telephone on the morning of [**8-11**], [**2149**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 84038**].

 INDICATION:  22-year-old male with cardiac arrest and right lower lobe
 aspiration/pneumonia.  Patient also with known surgical treatment of
 transposition of the great vessels.

 COMPARISON:  [**6-8**] and 19, [**2156**], chest radiographs, chest CT abdomen and
 pelvis [**2157-6-8**].

 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is in improved and satisfactory position 5 cm
 from the carina. New feeding tube courses through the mediastinum with tip
 overlying the expected region of the gastric fundus.  Consolidations within
 the right upper and lower lobes demonstrate improvement over a series of
 radiographs over several days consistent with improving aspiration.  The left
 lung remains clear.  No effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac
 silhouette is stable and consistent with transposition.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Standard placement of new feeding tube.
 2.  Improvement in right upper and lower lobe consolidations over two day
 period likely due to resolving aspiration.
 3.  Endotracheal tube in standard position after repositioning.

 COMPARISON:  Head CT without IV contrast, [**2157-6-8**] (nine hours prior).

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial imaging was performed from the cranial vertex to
 the foramen magnum without IV contrast.

 HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or
 shift of normally midline structures.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in
 size and configuration for the patient's age.  There is again sinus
 opacification involving the maxillary, ethmoid, and sphenoid sinuses, which
 may represent polypoid opacification or chronic sinusitis.

 IMPRESSION:  No hemorrhage or cerebral edema.

   I spoke to Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 8038**] son regarding his goals of care. We discussed
   his urosepsis on pressors, chronic poor nutrition status, and chronic
   pain. I relayed his very poor prognosis, and son seemed to have good
   understanding of this and reasonable expectations for survival. The son
   was concerned that DNR/DNI meant withdrawal of care, and that was why
   family had always been reluctant to do this. I explained that he could
   continue to have treatment (pressors, abx, etc) but that CPR/intubation
   would not improve his chronic medical issues and would likely diminish
   his quality of life. Once the son was aware of this, he felt that pt
   would most likely choose to be DNR/DNI; however, son wanted to talk to
   the rest of his family before formally making this decision. In
   addition, I mentioned his poor nutrition status and discussed tube
   feeding/PEG, the benefits and drawbacks to peg. We will rediscuss these
   issues tomorrow with family.

 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of central line placement in a patient
 with cardiac arrest.

 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH WAS COMPARED TO [**2105-3-9**].

 The ET tube tip is 7 cm above the carina.  The right internal jugular line tip
 is in mid SVC.  The patient is after median sternotomy and CABG with
 unremarkable appearance of post-sternotomy wires.  The cardiomegaly is
 present, most likely progressed compared to the prior study.  The patient is
 in moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.  A small left pleural effusion is
 demonstrated.  Note is made that the right costophrenic angle was not included
 in the field of view, thus the pleural effusion cannot be assessed.  No
 pneumothorax or rib fractures are demonstrated.

   # CARDIAC ARREST/SHOCK: Pt is waking up, remains intubated. Remains
   with assistance of IABP, though has good pressures to suggest that we
   will be able to wean this today, along with the dopamine. Our plan will
   be to go to 1:2 right now and if tolerated, will try a rapid wean q2h.
   Will wean dopamine as tolerated. Remain on anticoagulation given IABP.
   After IABP able to be removed, will seek extubation.

   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4992**] is an 88 year-old male with a history of CAD s/p PCI to LCx
   [**2128**], CHF, moderate to severe aortic stenosis who was transferred from
   [**Hospital3 519**] for catheterization with NSTEMI.  According to [**Hospital1 **]
   records the patient presented from home complaining of ""not feeling
   well"" since last night.  He had +cough productive of white sputum.  He
   denied chest pain, abdominal pain and fever.  He later complained of
   shortness of breath He was initially treated with IV diuresis and
   biomarkers were cycled.  Labs were significant for BNP 600, troponin
   0.08>1.43>1.65>0.38, CK 225>195, CKMB 12.7>8.9.  He also had a positive
   stress test.  Of note, he also had 7 beat run of VT at OSH and atenolol
   was increased.
   .
   Today during catheterization patient was noted to have tight 95-99%
   stenotic lesion just after the LCx stent.  The pressure wire was placed
   in the LAD and became totally occluded.  Patient had chest discomfort
   with ST depressions on ECG and decrease in BP.  At that time the
   patient became hypotensive and bradycardic.  He received 2mg Atropine
   and subsequently developed VF.  CPR was initiated.  He received
   multiple shocks ([**5-5**]), amiodarone 300mg x 1 followed by 150mg x 1,
   epinephrine 2mg and lidocaine 100mg x1.  He was also started on an
   amiodarone gtt at 2mg/min decreased to 1mg/min and a lidocaine gtt at
   2mg/min.  He was also intubated for airway protection.  An IABP was
   inserted.  The LAD was reopened successfully and stented with a bare
   metal stent.  An echocardiogram was also done in the cath lab which
   showed normal LV, ? small segment of anterior hypokinesis.  A Swan
   showed PCWP of 35 after the case (initially was 15).
   .
   On transfer to the CCU, the patient is intubated.  He is off of the
   lidocaine gtt, continues on amiodarone at 1mg/min and is on dopamine
   10mcg/min to maintain his MAPs.  An intra-aortic balloon pump is in
   place in the right groin.
   .
   Of note, at [**Hospital1 **] the patient was seen by GU for gross hematuria.
   This was felt attributable to traumatic catheter insertion.  They
   recommended sending urine cytology and outpatient cystoscopy to rule
   out mass or obstruction.

   Imaging: 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**4-/2129**] demonstrated:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function
   (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
   No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space
   which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral
   regurgitation with mildly thickened leaflets.
   Compared with the report (images unavailable for review) of [**2127-7-10**],
   aortic stenosis is not suggested on the current study and mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy is now seen. Biventricular
   systolic function and the severity of mitral regurgitation are similar.
   .
   Echocardiogram [**9-/2131**] showed EF of 65%, LV hypertrophy, dilated LA,
   calcified aortic valve with peak gradient of 35mmHg with valve area of
   0.5cm2, mild MR.
   .
   [**2132-1-28**] SPECT perfusion rest/persantine:
   - Broad moderate fixed inferior wall defect in perfusion consistent
   with an inferior myocardial infarct or scar.
   - Reversible perfusion defect suggesting ischemia w/in a broad portion
   of posterolateral left ventricle wall.
   - Septal and inferior wall hypokinesis, EF 52%
   Microbiology: None.
   ECG: EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm, rate 69, normal axis, no ST
   changes.  Flat to biphasic T waves in I, aVL, V6.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 88 year old male with history of CAD s/p stent to LCx
   (06), moderate to severe AS and diastolic dysfunction who was
   transferred from [**Hospital3 519**] for cath.  Catheterization was
   complicated by acute LAD occlusion during attempt to pass pressure wire
   and resultant VF arrest.  Spontaneous circulation returned after
   multiple shocks, epinephrine, lidocaine and amiodarone.
   .
   #. CAD: Known history of CAD s/p stent to LCx.  Cath today notable for
   stenosis distal to LCx stent.  During evaluation of anatomy patient
   developed TO of LAD which is known to supply collaterals to occluded
   RCA as well.  This resulted in VF arrest requiring multiple shocks,
   amiodarone, lidocaine.  A BMS was able to be placed to the LAD with
   resultant good flow.  Arrest is due to ischemia as clearly evidenced on
   catheterization TO of LAD so patient should improve now that coronary
   is reopened.
   - Continue IABP and follow MAPs on pump.  Continue dopamine as needed
   to maintain MAPs.
   - Continue amiodarone gtt for now.
   - Continue to cycle enzymes.
   - Heparin gtt once arterial sheath is pulled.
   - Continue ASA, Plavix
   - High dose statin
   - Consider repeat catheterization once acute issues resolved to
   intervene on LCx.
   - Check echocardiogram in the AM.
   .
   # s/p intubation: In setting of VF arrest no acute hypoxic or
   hypercarbic event.
   - Confirm tube placement with CXR.
   - Continue on mechanical ventilation overnight
   - Place Aline to follow ABGs.
   .
   #. Pump: Diastolic heart failure, aortic stenosis.  Initially with PCWP
   of 15, however after arrest PCWP elevated to 35.
   - Follow volume status with swan.  Diurese as able.
   - Once patient is no longer hypotensive consider restarting beta
   blocker and ACE inhibitor.
   - Check echocardiogram in the AM.
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 88 year old male with history of CAD s/p stent to LCx
   (06), moderate to severe AS and diastolic dysfunction who was
   transferred from [**Hospital3 519**] for cath.  Catheterization was
   complicated by acute LAD occlusion during attempt to pass pressure wire
   and resultant VF arrest.  Spontaneous circulation returned after
   multiple shocks, epinephrine, lidocaine and amiodarone.
   .
   # CARDIAC ARREST/SHOCK: Pt is waking up, remains intubated. Remains
   with assistance of IABP, though has good pressures to suggest that we
   will be able to wean this today, along with the dopamine. Our plan will
   be to go to 1:2 right now and if tolerated, will try a rapid wean q2h.
   Will wean dopamine as tolerated. Remain on anticoagulation given IABP.
   After IABP able to be removed, will seek extubation.

"492",1658,40897,"Chief Complaint:  s/p VF arrest
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4992**] is an 88 year-old male with a history of CAD s/p PCI to LCx
   [**2128**], CHF, moderate to severe aortic stenosis who was transferred from
   [**Hospital3 519**] for catheterization with NSTEMI.  According to [**Hospital1 **]
   records the patient presented from home complaining of ""not feeling
   well"" since last night.  He had +cough productive of white sputum.  He
   denied chest pain, abdominal pain and fever.  He later complained of
   shortness of breath He was initially treated with IV diuresis and
   biomarkers were cycled.  Labs were significant for BNP 600, troponin
   0.08>1.43>1.65>0.38, CK 225>195, CKMB 12.7>8.9.  He also had a positive
   stress test.  Of note, he also had 7 beat run of VT at OSH and atenolol
   was increased.
   .
   Today during catheterization patient was noted to have tight 95-99%
   stenotic lesion just after the LCx stent.  The pressure wire was placed
   in the LAD and became totally occluded.  Patient had chest discomfort
   with ST depressions on ECG and decrease in BP.  At that time the
   patient became hypotensive and bradycardic.  He received 2mg Atropine
   and subsequently developed VF.  CPR was initiated.  He received
   multiple shocks ([**5-5**]), amiodarone 300mg x 1 followed by 150mg x 1,
   epinephrine 2mg and lidocaine 100mg x1.  He was also started on an
   amiodarone gtt at 2mg/min decreased to 1mg/min and a lidocaine gtt at
   2mg/min.  He was also intubated for airway protection.  An IABP was
   inserted.  The LAD was reopened successfully and stented with a bare
   metal stent.  An echocardiogram was also done in the cath lab which
   showed normal LV, ? small segment of anterior hypokinesis.  A Swan
   showed PCWP of 35 after the case (initially was 15).
   .
   On transfer to the CCU, the patient is intubated.  He is off of the
   lidocaine gtt, continues on amiodarone at 1mg/min and is on dopamine
   10mcg/min to maintain his MAPs.  An intra-aortic balloon pump is in
   place in the right groin.
   .
   Of note, at [**Hospital1 **] the patient was seen by GU for gross hematuria.
   This was felt attributable to traumatic catheter insertion.  They
   recommended sending urine cytology and outpatient cystoscopy to rule
   out mass or obstruction.

   Imaging: 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**4-/2129**] demonstrated:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function
   (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
   No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space
   which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral
   regurgitation with mildly thickened leaflets.
   Compared with the report (images unavailable for review) of [**2127-7-10**],
   aortic stenosis is not suggested on the current study and mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy is now seen. Biventricular
   systolic function and the severity of mitral regurgitation are similar.
   .
   Echocardiogram [**9-/2131**] showed EF of 65%, LV hypertrophy, dilated LA,
   calcified aortic valve with peak gradient of 35mmHg with valve area of
   0.5cm2, mild MR.
   .
   [**2132-1-28**] SPECT perfusion rest/persantine:
   - Broad moderate fixed inferior wall defect in perfusion consistent
   with an inferior myocardial infarct or scar.
   - Reversible perfusion defect suggesting ischemia w/in a broad portion
   of posterolateral left ventricle wall.
   - Septal and inferior wall hypokinesis, EF 52%
   Microbiology: None.
   ECG: EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm, rate 69, normal axis, no ST
   changes.  Flat to biphasic T waves in I, aVL, V6.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 88 year old male with history of CAD s/p stent to LCx
   (06), moderate to severe AS and diastolic dysfunction who was
   transferred from [**Hospital3 519**] for cath.  Catheterization was
   complicated by acute LAD occlusion during attempt to pass pressure wire
   and resultant VF arrest.  Spontaneous circulation returned after
   multiple shocks, epinephrine, lidocaine and amiodarone.
   .
   #. CAD: Known history of CAD s/p stent to LCx.  Cath today notable for
   stenosis distal to LCx stent.  During evaluation of anatomy patient
   developed TO of LAD which is known to supply collaterals to occluded
   RCA as well.  This resulted in VF arrest requiring multiple shocks,
   amiodarone, lidocaine.  A BMS was able to be placed to the LAD with
   resultant good flow.  Arrest is due to ischemia as clearly evidenced on
   catheterization TO of LAD so patient should improve now that coronary
   is reopened.
   - Continue IABP and follow MAPs on pump.  Continue dopamine as needed
   to maintain MAPs.
   - Continue amiodarone gtt for now.
   - Continue to cycle enzymes.
   - Heparin gtt once arterial sheath is pulled.
   - Continue ASA, Plavix
   - High dose statin
   - Consider repeat catheterization once acute issues resolved to
   intervene on LCx.
   - Check echocardiogram in the AM.
   .
   # s/p intubation: In setting of VF arrest no acute hypoxic or
   hypercarbic event.
   - Confirm tube placement with CXR.
   - Continue on mechanical ventilation overnight
   - Place Aline to follow ABGs.
   .
   #. Pump: Diastolic heart failure, aortic stenosis.  Initially with PCWP
   of 15, however after arrest PCWP elevated to 35.
   - Follow volume status with swan.  Diurese as able.
   - Once patient is no longer hypotensive consider restarting beta
   blocker and ACE inhibitor.
   - Check echocardiogram in the AM.
   .
   #. Rhythm: Currently in sinus rhythm s/p VF arrest.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue on amiodarone gtt
   - Holding beta blocker [**12-31**] bradycardia and hypotension
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Creatinine 1.6 post arrest.
   - Trend creatinine.
   - Renally dose all meds.

 HISTORY:  ET tube and aortic balloon pump for cardiac arrest and MI.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:

 Tip of the intra-aortic balloon pump projects 3 cm above the carina,
 approximately 3.5 cm from the apex of the aortic knob.  ET tube in standard

 INDICATION:  Man status post cardiac arrest, question tube placement.

 COMPARISON:  None available.

 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:

 The left hemithorax is not completely imaged on the current study.  An ET tube
 terminates 3.4 cm above the carina.  An NG tube passes out of view below the
 diaphragm.  The mediastinal silhouette appears widened.  The visible lungs
 show air bronchograms in the retrocardiac area.

 IMPRESSION:

 Appropriate positioning of ET tube.  Widened mediastinum, clinical correlation
 recommended. Opacity in the retrocardiac area represents pneumonia vs
 atelactasis.

 These findings were communicated to the ED physician, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], at 8:58

 distal portion is superior to the renal arteries.  An OG tube port terminates
 within the esophagus and should be advanced at least 10 cm to be well within
 the stomach.  S.G. catheter terminates within the left main pulmonary artery
 and could be withdrawn 3 cm for better positioning.  An ET tube is 5.5 cm
 above the carina.

 There is bilateral pulmonary edema.  This is greater on the left, which could
 be gravitational.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged.  No focal consolidations.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Satisfactory position of intra-aortic balloon pump.
 2.  OG and PA catheter malpositioned.

   atrial fibrillation, started on disopyramide with torsades this morning
   S/P asystolic arrest-patient had episode of torsades that degenerated
   into asystole last night. She is
   --continue isoproteronal drip to target HR>80
   -continue levophed
   Torsades: patient started on disopyramide on saturday, and torsades is
   a known complication of this medication. Patient back in sinus with
   magnesium. Half life of disopyramide is 4.5-8 hours, but this may be
   delayed given the patients renal failure
   - discontinue disopyramide
   - if torsades continues despite magnesium, shock if unstable, overdrive
   pace at 100 if stable.
   - monitor on telemetry
   -continue q4 hour magnesium
   Atrial fibrillation: new onset, with rapid ventricular rate, patient
   now in sinus. Has been asymptomatic. some pulmonary edema on admission.
   History of hypothyroidism, on replacement, TSH normal in [**2124-10-23**]. No
   excessive alcohol or caffeine.
   - telemetry
   - continue carvedilol
   - heparin gtt pending breast biopsy and plan for cath and MVR
   - hold coumadin until all procedures are organized or done.
   - IV metoprolol or diltiazem as needed for rapid rates
   [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Cr 1.5 from baseline of 1.1. Likely to poor forward secondary to
   afib with RVR.
   - hold losartan and triamterene-HCTZ
   - control RVR as above
   - trend renal labs
   - renally dose meds as appropriate
   .
   Rheumatic Heart disease: This was diagnosed on this admission via ECHO.
   patient needs MV replacement and tricuspid repair per CT surgery. They
   will do this pending preop work up, including breast biopsy and cardiac
   catherization
   - Cardiac Surgery is following
   - heparin for now
   - will clarify if surgery will be inpatient this admission or as
   outpatient.
   Breast Mass: as seen on recent mammogram
   - patient on heparin gtt here, will try to get breast biopsy as
   inpatient. This was planned for [**2-7**], but may have to be delayed given
   torsades.
   - will call breast imaging to rearrange this after clarifyig that that
   is should be delayed.
   H/o CVA: holding home warfarin, on heparin gtt for now
   - will restart warfarin on discharge for both CVA and afib
   Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - insulin s.s.
   HTN: currently slightly hypertensive 140/96. will monitor for now.
   Fluid overload: Likely secondary to MVR. got lasix earlier this
   admission. No history of CHF, EF >55% on ECHO

   Assessment and Plan
   76-year-old woman with history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   and CVA on warfarin was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes
   after disopyramide initiation and now s/p cardiac arrest in the setting
   of sustained VT.
   s/p Code Blue and Intubation
   Patient had episode of torsades that degenerated into VT last night and
   now stable on levophed and isoproterenol.
   - continue isoproterenol to target HR > 80 and carvedilol to increase
   membrane stability and decrease PVCs
   - wean levophed
   - obtain repeat ECG
   - will need to pull femoral line and place right IJ or subclavian line
   - wean sedation and extubate as soon as possible after right IJ line
   placement
   Torsades
   Patient started on disopyramide on saturday, and torsades is a known
   complication of this medication. Last dose of disopyramide was on [**2-6**]
   AM. Half life of disopyramide is 4-8 hours; so would expect
   disopyramide to be metabolized and at minimal concentrations within 24
   hours of last dose. Patient now back in sinus.
   - daily ECGs
   - continue magnesium q4h
   - continue to hold disopyramide
   - if torsades continues, recommend magnesium push, consideration of
   lidocaine
   - monitor on telemetry
   - appreciate EP recs
   Atrial fibrillation:
   New onset, with rapid ventricular rate, and patient now in sinus. Has
   been asymptomatic.
   - telemetry
   - continue carvedilol
   - heparin gtt pending breast biopsy and plan for cath and MVR
   - hold coumadin until all procedures are organized or done.
   - IV metoprolol or diltiazem as needed for rapid rates
   [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   Cr 1.5 from baseline of 1.1. Likely to poor forward secondary to afib
   with RVR.
   - hold losartan and triamterene-HCTZ
   - control RVR as above
   - trend renal labs
   - renally dose meds as appropriate
   .
   Rheumatic Heart disease:
   This was diagnosed on this admission via ECHO. patient needs MV
   replacement and tricuspid repair per CT surgery. They will do this
   pending preop work up, including breast biopsy and cardiac
   catherization
   - Cardiac Surgery is following
   - heparin for now
   - will clarify if surgery will be inpatient this admission or as
   outpatient.
   Breast Mass: as seen on recent mammogram
   - patient on heparin gtt here, will try to get breast biopsy as
   inpatient. This was planned for [**2-7**] but will be delayed in the acute
   setting.
   - will call breast imaging to rearrange this after clarifyig that that
   is should be delayed.
   H/o CVA: holding home warfarin, on heparin gtt for now
   - will restart warfarin on discharge for both CVA and afib
   Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - insulin s.s.
   HTN: Patient has a history of hypertension, although currently on
   levophed after the cardiac arrest.
   - holding anti-hypertensives
   - will restart anti-hypertensives as needed
   - wean levophed
   Fluid overload: Likely secondary to MVR. got lasix earlier this
   admission. No history of CHF, EF >55% on ECHO
   - lasix as needed
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now
   Glycemic Control: Regular insulin sliding scale

   Assessment and Plan
   76-year-old woman with history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   and CVA on warfarin was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes
   after disopyramide initiation and now s/p cardiac arrest in the setting
   of sustained VT.
   s/p Code Blue and Intubation
   Patient had episode of torsades that degenerated into VT last night and
   now stable on levophed and isoproterenol.
   - continue isoproterenol to target HR > 80 and carvedilol to increase
   membrane stability and decrease PVCs
   - wean levophed
   - obtain repeat ECG
   - will need to pull femoral line and place right IJ or subclavian line
   - wean sedation and extubate as soon as possible after right IJ line
   placement
   Torsades
   Patient started on disopyramide on saturday, and torsades is a known
   complication of this medication. Last dose of disopyramide was on [**2-6**]
   AM. Half life of disopyramide is 4-8 hours; so would expect
   disopyramide to be metabolized and at minimal concentrations within 24
   hours of last dose. Patient now back in sinus.
   - daily ECGs
   - continue magnesium q4h
   - continue to hold disopyramide
   - if torsades continues, recommend magnesium push, consideration of
   lidocaine
   - monitor on telemetry
   - appreciate EP recs
   Atrial fibrillation:
   New onset, with rapid ventricular rate, and patient now in sinus. Has
   been asymptomatic.
   - telemetry
   - continue carvedilol
   - heparin gtt pending breast biopsy and plan for cath and MVR
   - hold coumadin until all procedures are organized or done.
   - IV metoprolol or diltiazem as needed for rapid rates
   [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   Cr 1.5 from baseline of 1.1. Likely to poor forward secondary to afib
   with RVR.
   - hold losartan and triamterene-HCTZ
   - control RVR as above
   - trend renal labs
   - renally dose meds as appropriate
   .
   Rheumatic Heart disease:
   This was diagnosed on this admission via ECHO. patient needs MV
   replacement and tricuspid repair per CT surgery. They will do this
   pending preop work up, including breast biopsy and cardiac
   catherization
   - Cardiac Surgery is following
   - heparin for now
   - will clarify if surgery will be inpatient this admission or as
   outpatient.
   Breast Mass: as seen on recent mammogram
   - patient on heparin gtt here, will try to get breast biopsy as
   inpatient. This was planned for [**2-7**] but will be delayed in the acute
   setting.
   - will call breast imaging to rearrange this after clarifyig that that
   is should be delayed.
   H/o CVA: holding home warfarin, on heparin gtt for now
   - will restart warfarin on discharge for both CVA and afib
   Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - insulin s.s.
   HTN: Patient has a history of hypertension, although currently on
   levophed after the cardiac arrest.
   - holding anti-hypertensives
   - will restart anti-hypertensives as needed
   - wean levophed
   Fluid overload: Likely secondary to MVR. got lasix earlier this
   admission. No history of CHF, EF >55% on ECHO
   - lasix as needed
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now
   Glycemic Control: Regular insulin sliding scale
   Lines:  Right femoral line
   - will pull femoral line and place right subclavian line

   - continue isoproterenol to target HR > 80 and carvedilol to increase
   membrane stability and decrease PVCs
   - wean levophed
   - obtain repeat ECG
   - will need to pull femoral line and place right IJ or subclavian line
   - wean sedation and extubate as soon as possible after right IJ line
   placement
   Torsades
   Patient started on disopyramide on saturday, and torsades is a known
   complication of this medication. Last dose of disopyramide was on [**2-6**]
   AM. Half life of disopyramide is 4-8 hours; so would expect
   disopyramide to be metabolized and at minimal concentrations within 24
   hours of last dose. Patient now back in sinus.
   - daily ECGs
   - continue magnesium q4h
   - continue to hold disopyramide
   - if torsades continues, recommend magnesium push, consideration of
   lidocaine
   - monitor on telemetry
   - appreciate EP recs
   Atrial fibrillation:
   New onset, with rapid ventricular rate, and patient now in sinus. Has
   been asymptomatic.
   - telemetry
   - continue carvedilol
   - heparin gtt pending breast biopsy and plan for cath and MVR
   - hold coumadin until all procedures are organized or done.
   - IV metoprolol or diltiazem as needed for rapid rates
   [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   Cr 1.5 from baseline of 1.1. Likely to poor forward secondary to afib
   with RVR.
   - hold losartan and triamterene-HCTZ
   - control RVR as above
   - trend renal labs
   - renally dose meds as appropriate
   .
   Rheumatic Heart disease:
   This was diagnosed on this admission via ECHO. patient needs MV
   replacement and tricuspid repair per CT surgery. They will do this
   pending preop work up, including breast biopsy and cardiac
   catherization
   - Cardiac Surgery is following
   - heparin for now
   - will clarify if surgery will be inpatient this admission or as
   outpatient.
   Breast Mass: as seen on recent mammogram
   - patient on heparin gtt here, will try to get breast biopsy as
   inpatient. This was planned for [**2-7**] but will be delayed in the acute
   setting.
   - will call breast imaging to rearrange this after clarifyig that that
   is should be delayed.

   ECHO: TTE (Complete) Done [**2144-10-12**] at 11:49:09 AM The left atrium is
   mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
   distal septum and inferior walls and apex. The apex is not aneurysmal.
   The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 %). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic
   stenosis (valve area could not be accurately quantified). Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral leaflets are mildly
   thickened/fibrotic. Mild to moderate ([**12-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be
   underestimated. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images
   reviewed) of [**2144-2-19**], mild regional left ventricular systolic
   function is now identified c/w CAD (distal LAD distribution), and the
   severity of mitral regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure are now increased. The severity of aortic stenosis is
   similar.

   CARDIAC CATH: C.CATH Study Date of [**2133-9-18**] 1. Coronary arteriography
   of the RCA revealed a 50% proximal stenosis and an ulcerated diffuse
   90% stenosis in the mid RCA with no significant disease in the distal
   RCA. 2. Mildly elevated PCWP of 20mm Hg. 3. Successful stenting of the
   mid RCA using one 15mm, one 11mm, and one 6mm Bard XT stent with final
   inflation using a 3.5mm Bandit resulting in TIMI 3 flow, no dissection,
   and no residual stenosis in the mid RCA. FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. One vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Successful stenting of the
   mid RCA.
   Assessment and Plan
   The pt. is an 80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF now
   admitted after PEA arrest.
   .
   # PEA arrest - the patient presented with complaints of N/V, diarrhea
   and became bradycardic followed by PEA arrest. Pt regained rhythm with
   epi/atropine X2. Unclear precipitant for arrest. She had K recorded at
   7.6 (hemolyzed) repeat 5.9. Hyperkalemia was treated with kayexelate.
   No clear acidosis prior to arrest on labs, glucose 129. Pt with few
   risk factor for PE, makes less likely than acute cardiac ischemic
   event. The patient was found to have CK elevated to 452 with MBI 9.7
   and troponin 3.74. In cath lab the patient was found to have markedly
   elevated PCWP to 45mmg Hg and mean PA to 46 mm Hg. Hemodynamics
   improved with RCA stenting. Pt now s/p RCA PCI.
   - Continue ASA, Plavix
   - Continue supportive management with mechanical ventilation
   - Given short duration of arrest approx 8 min with return of spont
   movement in cath lab, aortic sun protocol was deferred
   - Repeat TTE in am
   - Trend CK to peak
   - Wean sedation for neurological assessment
   - Monitor lytes, HD tonight for hyperkalemia and volume overload
   .
   # Multifocal Pulmonary infiltrate - CT demonstrated a diffuse
   consolidation of the lung bases with bronchial infiltration.
   - given unclear precipitant of PEA arrest, pt not clearly hypoxic on
   presentation but with initial elevated O2 requirement (FIO2 70%), CT
   with evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates - will cover with
   Vanc/Zosyn
   - obtain sputum cultures
   - consider dedicated chest CT when patient stable
   .
   #. ESRD on HD - Given markedly elevated PCWP and hyperkalemia, the
   patient was urgently dialyzed post-cath, continue to monitor lytes and
   fluid status
   .
   #. Chronic Diastolic CHF: Will repeat TTE in am to further evaluate
   systolic function and evidence of diastolic dysfunction. Hold
   metoprolol and losartan for now given unstable BP.
   .
   #. Hypertension - holding outpatient regimen of losartan, metoprolol,
   nifedipine while hypotensive
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid
   .
   #. Orthostatic hypotension - on midodrine as outpatient after HD, will
   hold for now
   .
   #. FEN - NPO for now, monitor K

   HPI:
   This is a 80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF now
   admitted after PEA arrest. The patient presented to the ER with
   complaints of nausea/emesis and diarrhea for three days. Reported she
   was unable to tolerate po intake and felt weak and lethargic. She
   denied abd pain. Reported fever intermittently. Last HD on
   friday.
   .
   In the ED, initial vitals were T: 98.2 HR: 77 BP: 136/56 RR: 20 O2Sat:
   100% RA. Vancomycin 1gm and zosyn given. The patient then became
   unresponsive and was found to be pulseless. CPR was begun. Pt  was
   intubated. She received epi 1mg IV, atropine 1mg IV, Bicarb 1 amp IV,
   Calcium chloride 1amp IV, followed by second round of epi/atropine with
   return of spontaneous circulation after approx 8 minutes. She was them
   given versed 2mg IV for sedation and a R femoral line and NGT were
   placed. The artic sun was placed. She was plavix loaded with 300mg,
   given ASA 600mg PR. 30g kayexelate given. Head CT showed no acute
   process but evidence of chronic microvascular ischemic disease. CT A/P
   with no acute intaabdominal process but bilateral pulmonary infiltrates
   concerning for PNA or aspiration. CE returned elevated with CK 452 MB
   44 MBI 9.7 and Troponin 3.74. ABG 7.21/54/203/23. She was taken
   urgently to the cath lab.
   .
   Cardiac catheterization revealed LAD with 80% mid stenosis, RCA with
   70% proximal, 90% distal - both stented with 0% residual. Severe
   bilateral iliac stenosis. She was given 200mg IV lasix and NTG to
   reduce PCWP from 45mmg Hg to 40mg Hg and mean PA from 46 to 40mm Hg.
   CO 5.4, CI 3.1. The artic sun protocol was not continued given duration
   of patient's arrest and her return of spontaneous movement post cath.

   infilterates of the lower lobes is concernong for multifocal pneumnia
   or aspiration.
   .
   Cardiac Catheterization [**2145-2-14**] - LAD with 80% mid stenosis, RCA with
   70% proximal, 90% distal - both stented with 0% residual. Severe
   bilateral iliac stenosis. She was given 200mg IV lasix and NTG to
   reduce PCWP from 45mmg Hg to 40mg Hg and mean PA from 46 to 40mm Hg.

   .
   ECHO: TTE (Complete) Done [**2144-10-12**] at 11:49:09 AM The left atrium is
   mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
   distal septum and inferior walls and apex. The apex is not aneurysmal.
   The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 %). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic
   stenosis (valve area could not be accurately quantified). Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral leaflets are mildly
   thickened/fibrotic. Mild to moderate ([**12-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be
   underestimated. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images
   reviewed) of [**2144-2-19**], mild regional left ventricular systolic
   function is now identified c/w CAD (distal LAD distribution), and the
   severity of mitral regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure are now increased. The severity of aortic stenosis is
   similar.
   .
   CARDIAC CATH: C.CATH Study Date of [**2133-9-18**] 1. Coronary arteriography
   of the RCA revealed a 50% proximal stenosis and an ulcerated diffuse
   90% stenosis in the mid RCA with no significant disease in the distal
   RCA. 2. Mildly elevated PCWP of 20mm Hg. 3. Successful stenting of the
   mid RCA using one 15mm, one 11mm, and one 6mm Bard XT stent with final
   inflation using a 3.5mm Bandit resulting in TIMI 3 flow, no dissection,
   and no residual stenosis in the mid RCA. FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. One vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Successful stenting of the
   mid RCA.
   Assessment and Plan
   The pt. is an 80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF now
   admitted after PEA arrest.
   .
   # PEA arrest - the patient presented with complaints of N/V, diarrhea
   and became bradycardic followed by PEA arrest. Pt regained rhythm with
   epi/atropine X2. Unclear precipitant for arrest. She had K recorded at
   7.6 (hemolyzed) repeat 5.9. Hyperkalemia was treated with kayexelate.
   No clear acidosis prior to arrest on labs, glucose 129. Pt with few
   risk factor for PE, makes less likely than acute cardiac ischemic
   event. The patient was found to have CK elevated to 452 with MBI 9.7
   and troponin 3.74. In cath lab the patient was found to have markedly
   elevated PCWP to 45mmg Hg and mean PA to 46 mm Hg. Hemodynamics
   improved with RCA stenting. Pt now s/p RCA PCI.
   - Continue ASA, Plavix
   - Continue supportive management with mechanical ventilation
   - Given short duration of arrest approx 8 min with return of spont
   movement in cath lab, aortic sun protocol was deferred
   - Repeat TTE in am
   - Trend CK to peak
   - Wean sedation for neurological assessment
   - Monitor lytes, HD tonight for hyperkalemia and volume overload
   .
   # Multifocal Pulmonary infiltrate - CT demonstrated a diffuse
   consolidation of the lung bases with bronchial infiltration.
   - given unclear precipitant of PEA arrest, pt not clearly hypoxic on
   presentation but with initial elevated O2 requirement (FIO2 70%), CT
   with evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates - will cover with
   Vanc/Zosyn
   - obtain sputum cultures
   - consider dedicated chest CT when patient stable
   .
   #. ESRD on HD - Given markedly elevated PCWP and hyperkalemia, the
   patient was urgently dialyzed post-cath, continue to monitor lytes and
   fluid status
   .
   #. Chronic Diastolic CHF: Will repeat TTE in am to further evaluate
   systolic function and evidence of diastolic dysfunction. Hold
   metoprolol and losartan for now given unstable BP.
   .
   #. Hypertension - holding outpatient regimen of losartan, metoprolol,
   nifedipine while hypotensive
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid
   .
   #. Orthostatic hypotension - on midodrine as outpatient after HD, will
   hold for now
   .
   #. FEN - NPO for now, monitor K
   .
   #. Access: R PA catheter
   .
   #. PPx: PPI, bowel regimen, heparin SC

   ECHO: TTE (Complete) Done [**2144-10-12**] at 11:49:09 AM The left atrium is
   mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
   distal septum and inferior walls and apex. The apex is not aneurysmal.
   The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 %). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic
   stenosis (valve area could not be accurately quantified). Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral leaflets are mildly
   thickened/fibrotic. Mild to moderate ([**12-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be
   underestimated. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images
   reviewed) of [**2144-2-19**], mild regional left ventricular systolic
   function is now identified c/w CAD (distal LAD distribution), and the
   severity of mitral regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure are now increased. The severity of aortic stenosis is
   similar.
   .
   CARDIAC CATH: C.CATH Study Date of [**2133-9-18**] 1. Coronary arteriography
   of the RCA revealed a 50% proximal stenosis and an ulcerated diffuse
   90% stenosis in the mid RCA with no significant disease in the distal
   RCA. 2. Mildly elevated PCWP of 20mm Hg. 3. Successful stenting of the
   mid RCA using one 15mm, one 11mm, and one 6mm Bard XT stent with final
   inflation using a 3.5mm Bandit resulting in TIMI 3 flow, no dissection,
   and no residual stenosis in the mid RCA. FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. One vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Successful stenting of the
   mid RCA.
   Assessment and Plan
   The pt. is an 80y.o F with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CVA, diastolic CHF now
   admitted after PEA arrest.
   .
   # PEA arrest - the patient presented with complaints of N/V, diarrhea
   and became bradycardic followed by PEA arrest. Pt regained rhythm with
   epi/atropine X2. Unclear precipitant for arrest. She had K recorded at
   7.6 (hemolyzed) repeat 5.9. Hyperkalemia was treated with kayexelate.
   No clear acidosis prior to arrest on labs, glucose 129. Pt with few
   risk factor for PE, makes less likely than acute cardiac ischemic
   event. The patient was found to have CK elevated to 452 with MBI 9.7
   and troponin 3.74. In cath lab the patient was found to have markedly
   elevated PCWP to 45mmg Hg and mean PA to 46 mm Hg. Hemodynamics
   improved with RCA stenting. Pt now s/p RCA PCI.
   - Continue ASA, Plavix
   - Continue supportive management with mechanical ventilation
   - Given short duration of arrest approx 8 min with return of spont
   movement in cath lab, aortic sun protocol was deferred
   - Repeat TTE in am
   - Trend CK to peak
   - Wean sedation for neurological assessment
   - Monitor lytes, HD tonight for hyperkalemia and volume overload
   .
   # Multifocal Pulmonary infiltrate - CT demonstrated a diffuse
   consolidation of the lung bases with bronchial infiltration.
   - given unclear precipitant of PEA arrest, pt not clearly hypoxic on
   presentation but with initial elevated O2 requirement (FIO2 70%), CT
   with evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates - will cover with
   Vanc/Zosyn
   - obtain sputum cultures
   - consider dedicated chest CT when patient stable
   .
   #. ESRD on HD - Given markedly elevated PCWP and hyperkalemia, the
   patient was urgently dialyzed post-cath, continue to monitor lytes and
   fluid status
   .
   #. Chronic Diastolic CHF: Will repeat TTE in am to further evaluate
   systolic function and evidence of diastolic dysfunction. Hold
   metoprolol and losartan for now given unstable BP.
   .
   #. Hypertension - holding outpatient regimen of losartan, metoprolol,
   nifedipine while hypotensive
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid
   .
   #. Orthostatic hypotension - on midodrine as outpatient after HD, will
   hold for now

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post cardiac arrest.  Evaluate for PE, dissection or other
 catastrophe.

 CTA CHEST:  Helical imaging was performed from the thoracic inlet to the pubic
 symphysis.  On the initial bolus secondary, there is only filling within the
 right heart and pulmonary arteries, so repeat imaging was performed from the
 thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis.  Sagittal and coronal reformats were
 prepared.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed same day.

 CTA CHEST:  There is no pulmonary embolism.  The left atrium is markedly
 enlarged.  There are no filling defects identified within the left atrium.
 Remaining [**Doctor Last Name 1443**] of the heart appear normal, although there may be
 dilatation of the left ventricle.  There is right basilar atelectasis.  There
 are hypoventilatory changes.  There are biapical small bullae.  There are
 emphysematous changes.  There is debris and secretion within the left (4:28)
 and right (4:33) main stem bronchi.  The patient is intubated with the ET tube
 in satisfactory position.  There is no significant axillary, hilar, or
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  The caliber and appearance of the thoracic aorta
 appears normal.

 CT ABDOMEN:  There is a wedge-shaped attenuation defect in the superior pole
 of the right kidney, compatible with a renal infarct.  Due to the late phase
 of imaging, full evaluation of the left renal artery is not possible.  The
 appearance and perfusion of the lower pole of the right kidney and left kidney
 appear normal.  The spleen is small but appears normal.  The adrenals and
 pancreas are unremarkable.  There are several low-attenuation lesions within
 the liver, suggestive of cysts.  There is mild periportal edema.  The
 gallbladder appears unremarkable with minimal fluid around the gallbladder
                                                             (Over)

 adenopathy.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious-appearing sclerotic or lytic lesions.
 There are mild degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection, although evaluation for
 dissection is slightly limited by late phase of imaging.

 defects in the right renal artery.  Otherwise, normal perfusion of the left
 and right kidneys.  No other solid organ perfusion abnormalities.

 3.  Severe left atrial enlargement without filling defects.

 4.  Secretions within the bronchi put the patient at risk for aspiration.

 5.  Hypodensities in the liver, suggestive of cysts, but too small to fully
 characterize.

   nausea after having her lopressor increased and diltiazem added several
   weeks ago for AF. She has had poor po intake, decreased UOP since
   discharge [**12-10**]. On admission, O2 sat 80%, INR 9.7, Cr 2.6 (from 1.4),
   CXR clear. She has been given ~ 4L IVF over course of the day. O2
   pleths have been unreliable throughout day although blood gas earlier
   in day with PaO2 of 133. This evening, repeat ABG performed due to
   persistently poor pleth revealed PaO2 41 with lactate 4. She was placed
   on NRB and transferred to CCU. Currently, she denies any current SOB.
   She notes her breathing feels much better than on admission. She denies
   any SOB at rest. No current CP, LH. Lengthy discussion held with
   patient regarding escalation of care with intubation and resuscitation
   if necessary and she was clear that she would not want CPR, electric
   shocks, or intubation.

   pulmonary edema. ECG AF with V rate 42. Diffuse low voltage. Nl axis.
   Diffuse TW flattening. Compared to prior [**2141-12-19**], HR is slower.
   A/P: 87 yoF w/ R heart failure, severe TR, severe pulmonary htn, PAF
   admitted with presyncope and nausea in the setting of uptitration of
   nodal agents and poor po intake now with unexplained hypoxia,
   hypotension, bradycardia, ARF, and supratherapeutic INR.
   Regarding her hypoxia, the cause is unclear. Worsened since admission.
   Main intervention has been IVF expansion but little evidence to suggest
   pulmonary edema. Suspect some contribution of severe pulmonary
   hypertension although would not explain acute worsening. Possibly
   related to R->L shunting from increased R sided filling pressures with
   volume expansion.
   Regarding her hypotension, bradycardia, and ARF, all presumed due to
   decreased po intake and increase in nodal agents 2 weeks ago. BPs
   improved after 4L IVF. HRs remains slow but presyncopal symptoms have
   improved. Unclear why Cr so variable during admission. Rare urine eos
   seen and urine Na 62 so may not be entirely prerenal in etiology.
   Patient does not want escalation of care. Wishes made clear that she is
   DNR/DNI. Good insight into her situation. Could consider trial of BiPAP
   but might worsen left sided filling given RV failure, TR, and pulm htn
   and unclear if will improve oxygenation dramatically w/o e/o pulm edema
   or underlying COPD.
   - cont high flow O2
   - consider trial of vasopressors to increase left sided afterload to
   see if improves oxygenation which would support diagnosis of R->L
   shunting

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 77 yo F w/ DMII, HTN, HLD, and dementia
   transferred from OSH s/p cardiac arrest, complicated by upper GI bleed
   and generalized seizure activity.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with multiple risk factors for CAD including
   DMII, HTN, HLD. She is s/p cardiac arrest, likely VF in setting of AED
   shocks x2. Concern for antero-lateral NSTEMI given ST depressions in
   V2-V6 and TWI in I and aVL. She is s/p cardiac catherization at OSH
   which shows severe 3VD including critical left main disease. Patient
   with negative troponins at OSH, but positive troponins noted in setting
   of ACS vs. troponin leak from AED shocks. Patient would benefit from
   Arctic Sun protocol given recent VF arrest, stable hemodynamics, and
   current GCS scale of 9 (< 10). Relative contra-indications include
   active GIB, but per discussion with post arrest team, pt can be
   re-warmed if bleeding worsened. Head CT negative for acute ICH.
   Patient received full dose ASA yesterday.  Arctic sun was initiated
   after 9h, and was stopped after 2.5h due to bradycardia and torsade de
   pointes.
   - Continue aspirin, at 81mg daily given GIB
   - high dose statin
   - low dose beta-blocker (metoprolol 6.25 [**Hospital1 **])
   - continue heparin gtt without bolus
   - no plavix for now given GIB
   - rewarm patient
   .
   # Rhythm / Torsade de pointes / Bradycardia:  Patient was initiated on
   Arctic sun cooling protocol 9h after the second episode of cardiac
   arrest at OSH.  Patient developed bradycardia, QTc prolongation and
   torsade de pointes which deteriorated to VF, s/p cardioversion x3.  Pt
   loaded with lidocaine, on lidocaine gtt.  She also received 4gm
   magnesium.
   - continue lidocaine gtt
   - Mg bolus if pt goes back to torsade de pointes
   - cardioversion if pt goes back to torsade de pointes and if she
   continues to be full code
   - replete K > 4, Mg > 2
   - telemetry

   # GI bleed: Likely UGIB in setting of anticoagulation received
   (heparin, ASA, plavix, integrillin). Patient on ASA at home, but no
   history of GI bleeds in the past. Patient is currently hemodynamically
   stable and receiving 2 U PRBCs. Guiac positive. Received 2u pRBC
   overnight.  Hct bumped appropriately from 31.8 to 37.2.  GI decided not
   to perform upper endoscopy given torsade de pointes.
   - active T&S

   # Hypotension: Patient was initially hypertensive after being admitted
   to CCU.  After initiation of Arctic Sun, patient has been bradycardic
   and hypotensive.  Arctic sun stopped after 2.5h, and patient is being
   rewarmed.  Medication effects are also playing a role, including nitro
   gtt which was discontinued, lidocaine gtt also leads to hypotension.
   GIB likely also plays a role.  NS bolus did not help significantly.
   - start dopamine gtt if BP non-responsive to NS boluses
   - continue lidocaine gtt with the understanding that it would drop BP
   - maintain goal MAP>60, UOP >30cc/hr, goal CVP 10cm
   - GIB management as above
   .
   # PUMP:  unknown EF. Patient appears likely hypovolemic on exam in
   setting of recent UGIB.
   - TTE to assess for EF.
   .
   # Seizure: Patient noted to have generalized seizure activity upon
   arrival to CCU. No acute bleed on Head CT. [**Month (only) 8**] be in setting of hypoxia
   s/p VF arrest.  Patient was loaded with dilantin.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 77 yo F w/ DMII, HTN, HLD, and dementia
   transferred from OSH s/p cardiac arrest, complicated by upper GI bleed
   and generalized seizure activity.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with multiple risk factors for CAD including
   DMII, HTN, HLD. She is s/p cardiac arrest, likely VF in setting of AED
   shocks x2. Concern for antero-lateral NSTEMI given ST depressions in
   V2-V6 and TWI in I and aVL. She is s/p cardiac catherization at OSH
   which shows severe 3VD including critical left main disease. Patient
   with negative troponins at OSH, but positive troponins noted in setting
   of ACS vs. troponin leak from AED shocks. Patient would benefit from
   Arctic Sun protocol given recent VF arrest, stable hemodynamics, and
   current GCS scale of 9 (< 10). Relative contra-indications include
   active GIB, but per discussion with post arrest team, pt can be
   re-warmed if bleeding worsened. Head CT negative for acute ICH.
   Patient received full dose ASA yesterday.  Arctic sun was initiated
   after 9h, and was stopped after 2.5h due to bradycardia and torsade de
   pointes.
   - Continue aspirin, at 81mg daily given GIB
   - high dose statin
   - low dose beta-blocker (metoprolol 6.25 [**Hospital1 **])
   - rewarm patient
   - continue heparin gtt without bolus
   .
   # Rhythm / Torsade de pointes / Bradycardia:  Patient was initiated on
   Arctic sun cooling protocol 9h after the second episode of cardiac
   arrest at OSH.  Patient developed bradycardia, QTc prolongation and
   torsade de pointes which deteriorated to VF, s/p cardioversion x3.  Pt
   loaded with lidocaine, on lidocaine gtt.  She also received 4gm
   magnesium.
   - continue lidocaine gtt
   - Mg bolus if pt goes back to torsade de pointes
   - cardioversion if pt goes back to torsade de pointes and if she
   continues to be full code
   - replete K > 4 Mg > 2
   - telemetry
   .
   # GI bleed: Likely UGIB in setting of anticoagulation received
   (heparin, ASA, plavix, integrillin). Patient on ASA at home, but no
   history of GI bleeds in the past. Patient is currently hemodynamically
   stable and receiving 2 U PRBCs. Guiac positive. Received 2u pRBC
   overnight.  Hct bumped appropriately from 31.8 to 37.2.  GI decided not
   to perform upper endoscopy given torsade de pointes.
   - active T&S
   - IV protonix gtt
   - has 2 PIVs and central line access
   - Hct checks [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue heparin gtt and aspirin given stable hct
   - f/u GI recs
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was initially hypertensive after being admitted
   to CCU.  After initiation of Arctic Sun, patient has been bradycardic
   and hypotensive.  Arctic sun stopped after 2.5h, and patient is being
   rewarmed.  Medication effects are also playing a role, including nitro
   gtt which was discontinued, lidocaine gtt also leads to hypotension.
   GIB likely also plays a role.
   - NS bolus prn
   - start dopamine gtt if BP non-responsive to NS boluses
   - continue lidocaine gtt with the understanding that it would drop BP
   - maintain goal MAP>60, UOP >30cc/hr
   - goal CVP 10cm
   - GIB management as above
   .
   # PUMP:  unknown EF. Patient appears likely hypovolemic on exam in
   setting of recent UGIB.
   - TTE to assess for EF.
   .
   # Seizure: Patient noted to have generalized seizure activity upon
   arrival to CCU. No acute bleed on Head CT. [**Month (only) 8**] be in setting of hypoxia
   s/p VF arrest.  Patient was loaded with dilantin.
   - f/u on final CT head read
   - f/u neuro recs
   - IV ativan 2 mg PRN: seizure activity
   - seizure precautions
   .
   #  HLD:
   - f/u fasting lipid panel
   .
   #  Diabetes Mellitus II:
   - hold metformin, continue ISS
   - f/u  HgA1c
   .
   #  Schizophrenia
   - continue risperdal
   .
   # Dementia:
   - continue Namenda
   .
   # PVD: s/p AAA repair
   - continue statin

   HPI:
   Pt is a 77 yo F with DMII, HTN, dementia, and paranoid schizophrenia
   who presented from an OSH after a witnessed cardiac arrest at her
   nursing home. Patient lives at [**Location 1801**] x1 year.  Per report, she was
   sitting in a chair before dinner when she was noted to become blue,
   slumped down into her chair, and became unresponsive. No report of
   chest pain or shortness of breath. She was carried back to her room,
   and approximately 3 minutes elapsed before CPR was started. She was
   coded for 15 minutes, and reportedly had an AED placed with 1 shock
   prior to EMT arrival. A perfusing rhythm was obtained, and she was
   intubated in the field and taken to [**Hospital6 7184**].
   .
   At OSH, pt's VS were 106/65 HR 100. EKG with ST depressions in V2-V6
   with no prior for comparison. She reportedly had another VF arrest 20
   minutes later, and was shocked at 200 J back in sinus tachycardia. She
   received 300 mg IV amiodarone x1. She then received ASA 325 mg PO x1,
   Plavix 600 mg PO x1, heparin gtt with bolus, integrillin gtt with
   bolus, and benadryl 25 mg IV x1. She underwent a cardiac catherization
   that showed a 90% left main stenosis, 60% proximal left circumflex, 80%
   RCA, 90% lesion followed by a long complex cork screw like 70% lesion
   in the proximal RCA.  Mid to distal RCA has a haze 95-99% lesion.  She
   was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for evaluation of CABG.
   .
   In the CCU, patient is unable to answer ROS due to intubation and
   sedation. She was noted to have bleeding from groin site. Angiosheath
   was removed and pressure held with good effect. NG tube was noted to be
   draining ~250 ccs of dark, frothy, coffee-ground blood. Gastric lavage
   was + after 750 ccs of irrigation. Also noted to have upward deviated
   gaze and seizure-like activity (first shaking of the upper extremities,
   and then lower extremities, then tongue fasciculations). Neurology
   urgently consulted, recommended IV dilantin load and IV ativan
   (received 6 mg IV total) with good control of seizure activity. A-line,
   R IJ placed, and patient sent for non-contrast CT and CTA to assess for
   acute ICH prior to initiating Arctic Sun protocol.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 77 yo F w/ DMII, HTN, HLD, and dementia
   transferred from OSH s/p cardiac arrest, complicated by upper GI bleed
   and generalized seizure activity.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with multiple risk factors for CAD including
   DMII, HTN, HLD. She is s/p cardiac arrest, likely VF in setting of AED
   shocks x2. Concern for antero-lateral NSTEMI given ST depressions in
   V2-V6 and TWI in I and [**Hospital1 **]. She is s/p cardiac catherization at OSH
   which shows severe 3VD including critical left main disease. Patient
   with negative troponins at OSH, but positive troponins noted in setting
   of ACS vs. troponin leak from AED shocks. Patient would benefit from
   Arctic Sun protocol given recent VF arrest, stable hemodynamics, and
   current GCS scale of 9 (< 10). Relative contra-indications include
   active GIB, but per discussion with post arrest team, pt can be
   re-warmed if bleeding worsened. Head CT negative for acute ICH.
   - patient received full dose ASA today x1
   - high dose statin, low dose beta-blocker
   - initiate Arctic Sun protocol; can re-warm if GI bleeding worsens
   - cisatricurium prn: shivering
   - will restart heparin gtt without bolus and plavix (pending results of
   overnight emergent GI endoscopy)
   - trend cardiac enzymes q6H
   .
   #  GI bleed: Likely UGIB in setting of anticoagulation received
   (heparin, ASA, plavix, integrillin). Patient on ASA at home, but no
   history of GI bleeds in the past. Patient is currently hemodynamically
   stable and receiving 2 U PRBCs. Guiac positive.
   - active T&S
   - IV protonix gtt
   - tx [**12-13**] U PRBCs for Hct < 30
   - 2 PIVs and central line access
   - Hct checks q4H
   - check post transfusion Hct
   - gastric lavage
   - restart heparin gtt and plavix pending GI endoscopy
   - hold ASA for now
   - GI consult for upper endoscopy
   .
   # PUMP:  unknown EF. Patient appears likely hypovolemic on exam in
   setting of recent UGIB.
   - TTE to assess for EF.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient is s/p VF arrest w/ shocks x2 and amiodarone load at
   OSH. Rhythm strip from EMTs shows coarse VF. Current sinus tachycardia
   on EKG likely in setting of pain and hypovolemia from recent GIB.
   - telemetry
   - replete K > 4 Mg > 2
   - continue amiodarone gtt
   .
   #  Seizure: Patient noted to have generalized seizure activity upon
   arrival to CCU. No acute bleed on Head CT. [**Month (only) 8**] be in setting of hypoxia
   s/p VF arrest.
   - neurology consult, appreciate recs
   - IV ativan 2 mg PRN: seizure activity
   - dilantin load
   - seizure precautions
   - 48 hour EEG
   - f/u final head CT read

   transferred from OSH s/p cardiac arrest, complicated by upper GI bleed
   and generalized seizure activity.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with multiple risk factors for CAD including
   DMII, HTN, HLD. She is s/p cardiac arrest, likely VF in setting of AED
   shocks x2. Concern for antero-lateral NSTEMI given ST depressions in
   V2-V6 and TWI in I and aVL. She is s/p cardiac catherization at OSH
   which shows severe 3VD including critical left main disease. Patient
   with negative troponins at OSH, but positive troponins noted in setting
   of ACS vs. troponin leak from AED shocks. Patient would benefit from
   Arctic Sun protocol given recent VF arrest, stable hemodynamics, and
   current GCS scale of 9 (< 10). Relative contra-indications include
   active GIB, but per discussion with post arrest team, pt can be
   re-warmed if bleeding worsened. Head CT negative for acute ICH.
   Patient received full dose ASA yesterday.  Arctic sun was initiated
   after 9h, and was stopped after 2.5h due to bradycardia and torsade de
   pointes.
   - continue heparin gtt without bolus
   - will give aspirin 81mg, high dose statin, plavix and low dose BB
   (metoprolol 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]) once pt is able to take PO meds from GIB stand
   point.
   - rewarm patient
   .
   # VF Arrest:  It appears that the first episode of VF arrest in the
   nursing home was related to ischemia.  However, the later VF arrest in
   OSH ED and the 4 episodes of VF overnight last night were due to
   re-perfusion given normalization of EKG, and no evidence of troponin
   elevation.  Pt loaded with lidocaine, on lidocaine gtt.  She also
   received 4gm magnesium.
   - continue lidocaine gtt, decrease to 1mg/min
   - cardioversion if pt goes back to VF and if she continues to be full
   code
   - replete K > 4, Mg > 2
   - telemetry
   .
   # Anoxic brain injury: Patient noted to have generalized seizure
   activity upon arrival to CCU. No acute bleed on Head CT. [**Month (only) 8**] be in
   setting of hypoxia after the 1st VF arrest.  Patient was loaded with
   dilantin. Patient was initiated on Arctic sun cooling protocol 9h after
   the second episode of cardiac arrest at OSH.  Patient developed
   bradycardia, QTc prolongation and VF, s/p cardioversion x3, arctic sun
   was therefore stopped.
   - d/c all sedating meds, including versed and phentanyl
   - f/u on final CT head read
   - need EEG to further assess neuro function
   - f/u neuro recs
   - IV ativan 2 mg PRN: seizure activity
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # GI bleed: Likely UGIB in setting of anticoagulation received
   (heparin, ASA, plavix, integrillin). Patient on ASA at home, but no
   history of GI bleeds in the past. Patient is currently hemodynamically
   stable and receiving 2 U PRBCs. Guiac positive. Received 2u pRBC
   overnight.  Hct bumped appropriately from 31.8 to 37.2.  GI decided not
   to perform upper endoscopy given VF episodes.
   - active T&S
   - continue IV protonix gtt
   - has 2 PIVs and central line access
   - Hct checks [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue heparin gtt
   - f/u GI recs on when pt can start to take PO meds
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was initially hypertensive after being admitted
   to CCU.  After initiation of Arctic Sun, patient has been bradycardic
   and hypotensive.  Arctic sun stopped after 2.5h, and patient is being
   rewarmed.  Medication effects are also playing a role, including nitro
   gtt which was discontinued, sedating medications including versed and
   phentanyl also lead to hypotension. GIB likely also plays a role.  NS
   bolus did not help significantly, so patient was put on dopamine gtt
   early this morning.
   - d/c versed and phentanyl
   - down-titrate dopamine as tolerated
   - maintain goal MAP>60, UOP >30cc/hr, goal CVP 10cm
   - GIB management as above
   .
   # PUMP:  unknown EF. Patient appears likely hypovolemic on exam in
   setting of recent UGIB.
   - TTE to assess for EF.
   .
   #  HLD:
   - f/u fasting lipid panel
   - continue high dose statin once taking PO meds
   .
   #  Diabetes Mellitus II:
   - hold metformin, continue ISS
   - f/u  HgA1c
   .
   #  Schizophrenia
   - continue risperdal once taking PO meds
   .
   # Dementia:
   - continue Namenda once taking PO meds
   .
   # PVD: s/p AAA repair

 the use of IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed at
 2-mm slice thickness.

 FINDINGS:  There is mild loss of the [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation
 globally, some of which can be attributed to technique.  The ventricles and
 sulci are normal in size and configuration.  There is no evidence of
 hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or large vascular territorial infarction.  The
 suprasellar and quadrigeminal cisterns are preserved.  There is no suspicious
 osseous lesion.  Mild mucosal thickening is seen within the ethmoid and
 maxillary sinuses.  The middle ear cavities and mastoid air cells are clear.
 Left ocular lens is not seen.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild loss of [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation may be related to
 technique, however, in the context of cardiac arrest, may reflect transient
 global hypoxia.  Correlate with neurological examination and consider
 followup/further workup as clinically indicated.
 2.  Mild paranasal sinus disease.

                       DIVISION OF CARDIOLOGY
                   COMPREHENSIVE CONSULTATION NOTE
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Patient is seen in consultation today at the
request of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 775**]. We are asked to give consultative advice
regarding evaluation and management of tachycardia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
81F PMH coronary artery disease, s/p CABG/MVR, atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, CHF (EF 30%), COPD, and chronic renal
insufficiency, admitted with dyspnea, found to have atrial
tachycardia s/p DCCV and amiodarone, and who had the development
of a wide complex tachycardia treated with DCCV. Per report (see
admission H&P for details), the night prior to admission,  she
began feeling chest pain that felt ""like a [**Doctor Last Name **] in my chest"" and
noticed her heart beating quickly. She felt short of breath,
weak, nauseaous, with abdominal pain and ""like I was dying"". The
chest pain and SOB continued overnight, and when her nurse called
her in the morning to check in, she decided to call 911. EMS
found pt hypotensive, with pulse in 170s with wide complex
tachycardia, and in the setting of her known DNR order, gave her
150mg amiodarone and aspirin in the field.  According to the
patient, she had been having chest pain off and on for the past
few months.  In ED, initial vital signs were: 98.8 61/39, 168,
23, 100% on NRB. In ED appeared uncomfortable, minimally tender
in the epigastrium, found to have maroon guaiac positive stools,
2+ non-pitting edema bilaterally. On ECG, she had a wide complex
rhythm that was thought to be aflutter, and she was given
midazolam and cardioverted with 100J initially, at which point
she went into a wide complex rhythm, and was defibrillated with
200J and converted to Sinus. Labs were felt to be consistent with
organ hypoperfusion, and her CXR showed CHF and pulmonary edema.
She had a CT scan that showed equivocal colitis, for which she
was covered with levo/vanco/flagyl, but developed a rash so
levoflox was stopped. She was given a 150mg IV amiodarone bolus
after cardioversion, and is currently on an amiodarone gtt.
Surgery was consult for increased lactate.
On further questioning, she reports symptoms of both the
abdominal pain and the chest pain with exertion over the past few
months.  She reports significant activity limitation with
dyspnea, as well as LE edema and PND/Orthopnea.
On ROS, the patient denied fever, cough, vomiting, melena, blood
in stools. She did endorse weight loss over the past few months,
anorexia X months, chronic LE edema, constipation (no BM X 5-6
days), a history of diarrhea with abdominal pain (unclear time
course), and a feeling of increased pressure in her head. Most
recent weights in clinic about 145 lb. In clinic [**4-29**], she
complained of decreased urination, but was not found to be volume
overloaded on exam, BP 80/40 (near baseline per note). Was found
to have elevated Cr and K from [**4-29**] labs, refused medical
intervention and so was treated with stopping ACE-I and
spironolactone and took kayexalate as an outpatient.  Around that
time, she apparently had an extensive discussion concerning code
status with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1788**] (see note in OMR). Briefly, she has
been DNR/DNI for years and expressed a wish to be dead, wanting
to pass in her sleep. She did not want any futile aggressive
interventions (e.g. long term supportive care, or intervention if
she is ""very sick"") but is equivocal about temporary less
aggressive measures; according to notes, she ""should remain
DNR/DNI with potential cardioversion or other interventions
considered in the setting of acute abnormality with
semi-stability. Full ACLS resuscitation with CPR / intubation
would not be consistent with her wishes. She does continue to be
interested in aggressive
medical management"".
On cardiac review of symptoms, the patient denies any chest pain
or anginal equivalent, shortness of breath, dysnpea on exertion,
orthopnea, PND, palpitations, syncope or presyncope, or
claudication-type symptoms.

TELEMETRY: Sinus at 65.  Occasional PVCs.
ECG [**2106-5-12**] 10:56AM: Wide complex tachycardia at 168 BPM.  LBBB
morphology with L axis.  Delayed R wave transition to V4/V5, with
QS in V1/V2.  No evidence of AV dissociation, P wave axis is ~
-60 with short RP.  Overall, morphology is similar to prior from
[**2106-3-31**], only wider.
ECG [**2106-5-12**] 11:01AM Rhythm strip: Wide complex tachycardia at
about 180-200 with RBBB pattern and R superior axis.  Different
morphology to prior ECG, but similar to PVCs in subsequent ECGS.
ECG [**2106-5-12**] 11:04AM: Sinus at 67 with PVC with superior left
axis, although morphology is different from the prior wide
complex rhythm above. [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 14337**].  L-axis with poor RW
progression precordials. Lateral TW inversions with < 1mm ST
depression in III.
TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2105-6-12**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate to severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferolateral
hypokinesis, and akinesis of the distal [**2-14**] of the left
ventricle. There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 30%). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is
present. Prosthetic leaflets are mildly thickened, but
transvalvular gradient is normal. No mass or vegetation is seen
on the mitral valve. Torn mitral chordae are present. Eccentric,
anteriorly-directed mild to moderate ([**2-13**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Mitral valve bioprosthesis with slightly thickened
leaflets, normal gradient, and mild-moderate valvular
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2104-7-1**],
regional LV wall motion abnormalities are somewhat more
extensive. Pulmonary pressures are higher. The other findings are
similar.
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION ([**2099**]):
  1. Coronary angiography of this left dominant system revealed
significant coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
angiographically
normal. The LAD gave rise to a long, high D1 branch which
travelled as
part of a ""twin LAD"" system, referred to as ramus intermedius on
prior operative note.  The true LAD gave off few true branches
and had
mild disease only. The large D1 had a proximal 30% lesion only
and competitive flow distally.  The dominant LCx system and
non-dominant
RCA had only mild luminal disease as well.
  2. Graft arteriography revealed the LIMA-diagonal (or ramus
intermedius) to be patent.
  3. Resting hemodynamic measurements revealed normal righ sided
filling
pressures, mildly elevated pulmonary artery pressures and
elevated left
heart filling pressures with a mean PCWP of 24 mmHg and LVEDP of
mmHg.  There was a mean pressure gradient of 8.4 mmHg across the
bioprosthetic mitral valve (as measured between the PCWP and LV
pressure
tracngs), for a calculated valve area of 1.6 cmsq.  Cardiac
output and
index were preserved at 6.1 L/min and 3.4 L/min/m2 respectively.
There
was no gradient across the aortic valve upon catheter pullback
from the
left ventricle.
  4. Left ventriculography revealed severe anteroapical
hypokinesis and
milder inferior hypokinesis with an ejection fraction calculated
at 36%.
No mitral regurgitation was observed.
P-MIBI ([**2105-6-12**]):
The patient was administered
0.142 mg/kg/min of Persantine over 4 minutes. No chest, back,
neck or
arm discomforts were reported by the patient during the
procedure. No
significant ST segment changes were noted from baseline. The
rhythm was
atrial fibrillation with occasional isolated VPDs. Possible rare
aberration was noted (?[**Last Name (un) 14338**] beats). The hemodynamic response
to the
Persantine infusion was appropriate. Post-infusion the patient
administered 125 mg aminophylline IV.
MIBI: 1. Stable moderate to severe defects involving with
anterior, apical,
anterolateral and lateral wall as described above with
reversibilty seen in the
basal anterior wall only.
2. Dilated LV cavity size with a calulated EDV of 166 ml, reduced
from 202 ml
previously but with evidence for transient ischemic dilation.
3. Reduced ejection fraction at 29%, further reduced from 36%
previously.
OTHER TESTING:
CT A/P [**2106-5-12**]:
1. Mild thickening along the transverse colon with associated
stranding in
the region of the hepatic flexure may represent colitis. Etiology
could be
inflammatory, infectious, or ischemic.
2. Post-cholecystectomy with increasing diameter of the common
bile duct
compared with prior exam. Recommend clinical correlation and if
needed
ultrasound may be obtained to further assess.
3. Moderate fecal loading of the rectum.
4. Fat and fluid-containing periumbilical hernia, stable.
CXR [**2106-5-13**]:
As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
increased, likely to reflect improved ventilation. On the right,
the contour
of the diaphragm is less well delineated, raising the suspicion
for small
right pleural effusion. On the left, no larger effusion is
present.
Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, no pulmonary edema. No interval
appearance
of parenchymal opacities
LABORATORY DATA: Reviewed in OMR
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
81F PMH coronary artery disease, s/p CABG/MVR, atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, CHF (EF 30%), COPD, and chronic renal
insufficiency, admitted with dyspnea, found to have wide complex
tachycardia s/p DCCV and amiodarone, and who had the development
of a different wide complex tachycardia treated with DCCV. Based
on assessment of her ECGs, she appears to have been in an SVT
with aberrancy on arrival to the ED, which appears to be a short
RP tachycardia possibly AVNRT vs atrial tachycardia.  The wide
QRS in this setting is most likely due to her acidosis at the
time, although it may also have an element of delayed conduction
in the His-Purkinje system.  Upon cardioversion attempt on
amiodarone, she appears to have gone into a wide complex more
consistent with VT, which was subsequently converted with repeat
DCCV (her PVCs have this similar morphology, which localized to
the lateral LV probably around the site of her aneurysm).  At
this point, the most pressing cardiac issues in this patient
concern prevention of future arrhythmias, treatment of her CHF,
which is probably NYHA class III/IV, and management of her
ongoing GI bleed in the setting of chronic anticoagulation.
Based on her goals as stated to her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] is DNR, and would
thus probably not be a candidate for an ICD.  Continuing
amiodarone is not unreasonable for prevention of VT, although the
most important issue for the likely SVT will be continuing nodal
agents.  EPS may also be useful, as she could potentially be
cured of the AVNRT if this is the etiology, although again this
may not be consistent with her goals.  As far as her CHF, she is
reasonably euvolemic, and in the setting of probable ischemia
colitis, would probably not diurese her too aggressively for now.
Would continue antibiotics and maintain euvolemia, monitor Hct
and further GI symptoms/bleeding, and follow recs as per surgery
or GI.  Once her GI issues are stable and she has less evidence
of end-organ damage, might consider diuresis and initiation of
treatments for her CHF (Imdur/hydral given her history of CRF and
hypovolemia previously). As far as her positive cardiac
biomarkers, these are probably due to demand rather than an acute
coronary syndrome, and should be trended to decrease.  Given her
ongoing GI bleed, would avoid any additional
anticoagulation/antiplatelets, but would try to keep her on
aspirin if possible.  Overall, her goals of care will probably be
the most pressing point.  She could and probably should undergo a
cath on this admission, if that is something she would want.  If
not, then hospice, etc. should be discussed.
The Assessment and Plan will be reviewed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
multi- disciplinary rounds.  Please see his/her note in the
[**Hospital 7382**] medical record for further comments and
recommendations.  Thank you for allowing us to participate in the
care of this patient. Please feel free to contact us with any
questions or concerns.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo female with history of CHF (EF 30%), Afib on coumadin, s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea and CP, found to be hypotensive. Cardioverted for
   ?aflutter, developed v-tach, defibrillated, returned to NSR. CTAb
   showed equivocal colitis. Admitted to MICU for hypotension.
   .
   # Shock. Likely secondary to dehydration in setting of anorexia and
   nausea, together with recent rapid ventricular rates, and baseline
   impaired cardiac function (given mild pulmonary vascular congestion on
   CXR, chronic CHF). Baseline bp appears low (syst in 80s at clinic).
   Differential also includes sepsis, especially in setting of mild
   leukocytosis and colitis seen on CT, though afebrile and WBC not
   significantly elevated.
   - Vasodilatory source: colitis
        - treat with vanco/flagyl/ceftriaxone; follow exam
        - appreciate surgery recs
        - trend lactate
        - check C. Diff
        - follow blood, urine cultures
   - Hypovolemic source: dehydration (pt appears generally volume
   depleted)
        - fluid boluses to maintain UOP and MAP goal of >55 then to
   maintenance fluids when 50 cc/hr UOP achieved
   - Cardiogenic (baseline CHF with low EF, together with superimposed
   arrhythmia)
        - check TTE
        - PE unlikely given supratherapeutic INR
   # Tachy-arrhythmia. Pt with possible a-flutter and RVR initially,
   developed VTach after synchronized cardioversion, returned to NSR with
   defib. Cardiology and EP saw pt in ED.
   - Continue amiodarone gtt, move to PO amiodarone if long term control
   needed
   - Consider AICD
   - Maintain K > 4 (watch renal function though), Mg > 2
   - If persistently hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation, will
   discontinue amiodarone and return to lopressor
   - Restart Coumadin for A-fib when INR within therapeutic range
   .
   # Subacute renal failure. Creatinine 3.2, baseline 1.1 but was elevated
   [**4-29**] to 3.3 (pt refused to seek medical attention at time). Likely
   prerenal in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with intravascular
   depletion. Foley in place. Urine lytes: BUN 506, Cr 94, Na < 10, FeNa
   about 0.2% implies likely prerenal etiology.
   - Continue gentle fluid boluses and monitor UOP; trend creatinine and
   monitor UOP
   - Renally dose medications
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I and diuretics
   .
   # NSTEMI. Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG. In setting of
   acute illness, tachycardia
   - Cycle enzymes
   - Manage CAD as below
   - Continue atorvastatin, ASA
   - Repeat ECG
   - Anticoagulation if continued enzyme rise
   .
   # Hepatitis. s/p cholecystectomy. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of
   shock liver.
   - Trend LFTs; manage hypotension (see above)
   - NPO for now
   - Hepatitis viral panel if persistent elevation
   # Abdominal pain/colitis on CT (prelim read). Surgery consulted,
   recommend continue resuscitation, enema, trend labs/lactate, empiric
   abx. Pt is s/p cholecystectomy.
   - Appreciate surgery recs, will follow with serial exams
   - Gentle enema given impaction, colace / senna
   - Trend lactate
   - Empiric IV abx for now as above
   - Follow up final read ab/pelvis CT
   .
   # GIB. Guaiac positive stools
   - Follow Hct.
   .
   # CHF
   - Hold lasix while hypotensive
   - Hold Metoprolol, ACE-I, spironolactone while hypotensive
   .
   # Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis
   - Continue albuterol, cromolyn spray
   - Continue fluticasone nasal spray and inhaler
   - Continue benadryl
   .
   # Anxiety
   - Continue fluoxetine; hold trazodone for now
   .

   Chief Complaint:  Dyspnea
   HPI:
   81 yo F with a history of CHF (EF 30%), afib on coumadin, s/p CABG
   presents with dyspnea. This morning called EMS, EMS found pt
   hypotensive, with pulse in 170s, gave pt 150mg amiodarone and aspirin
   in the field. The pt reports that she has had worsening SOB for several
   days, but denies PND, DOE or orthopnea. Denies fever, chills, rigors,
   night sweats. Endorses anorexia, weight loss, fatigue. Denies urinary
   symptoms. Endorses diarrhea for approximately a month.
   .
   In ED, initial vital signs were: 98.8 61/39, 168, 23, 100% on NRB. In
   ED appeared uncomfortable, minimally tender in the epigastrium, found
   to have maroon guaiac positive stools, 2+ non-pitting edema
   bilaterally. On EKG appeared to be in aflutter, given midazolam,
   cardioverted with 100J initially, then went into VTACH, defib with
   200J, converted to NSR. Labs significant for hypoperfusion, CXR appears
   to be c/w CHF, pulmonary edema. CTAb showed equivocal colitis. Covered
   with vanco/flagyl, got levoflox then developed a rash so levoflox was
   stopped. Got 150mg IV amiodarone after cardioversion, now on amiodarone
   gtt. Surgery consult for increased lactate. Cardiology, EP looked at
   EKG, rhythm strip, no reccommendations. On transfer, VS were 102/49, P
   60, 19, 100% 3.5L. No has 2 PIVs. Has gotten 1750 cc IVF, 200 cc in
   foley.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F with CHF (EF 30%), CAD, Asthma/COPD, presents with dyspnea,
   found to be in ventricular tachycardia and atrial flutter, now s/p
   cardioversion and defibrillation in sinus rhythm with hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension/Shock: Suspect that the patient is dehydrated (possibly
   due to poor po intake and diarrhea) and that this is the cause of her
   hypotension. Infection and sepsis are also a possibility given lactate
   of 7 and leukocytosis. The patient does not appear to be in cardiogenic
   shock now that her rhythm is no longer tachycardic.
   - Check blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Follow up final read of CT Ab/Pelv
   - Hold off on antihypertensives for now
   - Bolus for low BP's
   - Consider CVL and pressors if BP refractory to IVF boluses
   - Continue flagyl for now given diarrhea
   - Repeat venous lactate
   - Check pulsus
   -Check ECHO in am
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Seen by cardiology in ED, does not have evidence of evolving
   ST changes on EKG. Given guaiac positive stool will hold off on heparin
   since pt has signs of
demand
 ischemia secondary to malignant rhythm
   from earlier in the day.
   - Cardiology consult in am
   - ECHO
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   # Atrial flutter/Ventricular tachycardia: In the ED the pt was found to
   be in atrial flutter that converted to Vtach with 100J, and then
   converted to sinus with 200J. Suspect that pt's baseline afib was
   aggravated by dehydration/hypovolemia. Of note, on an old EP study they
   were able to induce VT, likely due to old MI scar.
   - Pt is currently bradycardic and hypotensive, hold beta blocker for
   now
   - Cardiology consult in am
   - Replete K and Mg aggressively
   .
   # Colitis: Evidence of stranding and colonic thickening raise concern
   for colitis. Pt reports that she has had intermittent non-bloody
   diarrhea, but did not have tenderness on exam.
   - Continue flagyl for now
   - Send stool cultures
   - Serial abdominal exams
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt's creatinine was 3.2 on admission, stable
   from [**2106-4-29**], but significantly elevated compared to prior values in
   the mid 2's. Suspect that this is a combination of prerenal renal
   failure in addition to likely poor forward flow in the setting of heart
   failure. There also may be a component of ATN since the pt was found
   hypotensive in the 60's systolic at home.
   - Check urine lytes, urine culture
   - Hold lisinopril, spironolactone, lasix for now

   # Hepatitis: Suspect that the elevation of the pt's LFTs (transaminases
   and LDH) are a reflection of shock liver in the setting of recent
   hypotension. At a recent clinic visit the pt's BP was noted to be in
   the 80's systolic on [**4-29**]. There also may be a congestive hepatopathy
   component given pt's cogestive heart failure. Of note, the pt does have
   a chronically elevated common bile duct that now measures >20cm in
   diameter. This may represent a retained stone, however alk phos and
   bili are normal so cholangitis, choledocholithiasis seem unlikely.
   - Trend LFT's for now
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: On coumadin, with a supratherapeutic INR here.
   Since the pt was guaiac positive in ED will plan to hold coumadin
   tonight.
   - Currently rate controlled, consider re-starting beta-blocker once pt
   is no longer hypotensive.
   .
   # Guaiac positive maroon stool: Hct is stable, but this may be falsely
   elevated secondary to hypovolemia/dehydration. Pt denies hematemesis,
   melena. There was no evidence of diverticulitis on CT ab.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F with CHF (EF 30%), CAD, Asthma/COPD, presents with dyspnea,
   found to be in ventricular tachycardia and atrial flutter, now s/p
   cardioversion and defibrillation in sinus rhythm with hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: Suspect that the patient is dehydrated (possibly due to
   poor po intake and diarrhea) and that this is the cause of her
   hypotension. Infection and sepsis are also a possibility given lactate
   of 7 and leukocytosis. The patient does not appear to be in cardiogenic
   shock now that her rhythm is no longer tachycardic.
   - Check blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Follow up final read of CT Ab/Pelv
   - Hold off on antihypertensives for now
   - Bolus for low BP's
   - Consider CVL and pressors if BP refractory to IVF boluses
   - Continue flagyl for now given diarrhea
   - Repeat venous lactate
   .
   # Atrial flutter/Ventricular tachycardia: In the ED the pt was found to
   be in atrial flutter that converted to Vtach with 100J, and then
   converted to sinus with 200J. Suspect that pt's baseline afib was
   aggravated by dehydration/hypovolemia. Of note, on an old EP study they
   were able to induce VT, likely due to old MI scar.
   - Pt is currently bradycardic and hypotensive, hold beta blocker for
   now
   - Consider EP consult
   - Replete K and Mg aggressively
   .
   # Colitis: Evidence of stranding and colonic thickening raise concern
   for colitis. Pt reports that she has had intermittent non-bloody
   diarrhea, but did not have tenderness on exam.
   - Continue flagyl for now
   - Send stool cultures
   - Serial abdominal exams
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt's creatinine was 3.2 on admission, stable
   from [**2106-4-29**], but significantly elevated compared to prior values in
   the mid 2's. Suspect that this is a combination of prerenal renal
   failure in addition to likely poor forward flow in the setting of heart
   failure. There also may be a component of ATN since the pt was found
   hypotensive in the 60's systolic at home.
   - Check urine lytes, urine culture
   - Hold lisinopril, spironolactone, lasix for now
   .
   # Hepatitis: Suspect that the elevation of the pt's LFTs (transaminases
   and LDH) are a reflection of shock liver in the setting of recent
   hypotension. At a recent clinic visit the pt's BP was noted to be in
   the 80's systolic on [**4-29**]. There also may be a congestive hepatopathy
   component given pt's cogestive heart failure. Of note, the pt does have
   a chronically elevated common bile duct that now measures >20cm in
   diameter. This may represent a retained stone, however alk phos and
   bili are normal so cholangitis, choledocholithiasis seem unlikely.
   - Trend LFT's for now
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: On coumadin, with a supratherapeutic INR here.
   Since the pt was guaiac positive in ED will plan to hold coumadin
   tonight.
   - Currently rate controlled, consider re-starting beta-blocker once pt
   is no longer hypotensive.
   .
   # Guaiac positive maroon stool: Hct is stable, but this may be falsely
   elevated secondary to hypovolemia/dehydration. Pt denies hematemesis,
   melena. There was no evidence of diverticulitis on CT ab.
   - Trend hct q8h

 INDICATION:  Status post MVC, cardiac arrest.

 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine radiographs of the chest.

 COMPARISONS:  None available.

 FINDINGS:  Trauma board and other overlying structures limit assessment.  Low
 lung volumes are seen.  Haziness to the apices, greater on the left, may
 simply be due to low lung volumes and atelectasis.  Nasogastric tube courses
 into the stomach and out of view.  Enlargement of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is likely due to AP and supine technique.  Endotracheal tube is
 presumed given the history, but not well seen, looks to terminate above the
 clavicles, however, this is an extreme lordotic view.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.

 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process with bilateral atelectasis as on

 INDICATION:  Status post cardiac arrest, evaluate endotracheal tube placement.

 COMPARISON:  None available.

 FINDINGS:  Portable supine AP view of the chest:  The endotracheal tube is no
 less than 7 cm above the carina.  A right internal jugular central venous
 catheter terminates at the approximate location of the cavoatrial junction.
 There is an orogastric tube coursing through the esophagus, and below the
 inferior edge of the radiograph toward the location of the stomach.

 There is diffuse reticular opacification of the bilateral lung fields.  Lungs
 are otherwise clear.  There is minimal cardiomegaly.  Widening of the superior
 mediastinum is consistent with venous engorgement.  There is no pneumothorax
 or large pleural effusion.  There are surgical clips in the right upper
 quadrant, likely from cholecystectomy.  The aorta is tortuous and contains
 atherosclerotic calcification.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube approximately 7 cm above the carina, which could be
 advanced by 2 to 3 cm.
 2.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema and signs of pulmonary vascular
 congestion likely secondary to resuscitation efforts.  However, underlying
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Consider reimaging after optimization of fluid
 status.

 at the left base.  There has been improvement in the opacities previously seen
 in the left and right upper zones and in the right cardiophrenic region.
 Minimal residual atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic area is identified. No
 CHF. No gross effusion.  The right costophrenic angle is excluded from the
 film. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged allowing for
 differences in technique.  As before, the mediastinum is prominent and the
 cardiac silhouette slightly enlarged.

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest MDCT of the upper two-thirds of the chest was performed
 using 5-mm axial slice thickness.

 FINDINGS:  This study was performed for localization prior to chest tube
 placement.

 In comparison to earlier today, there is no residual pneumothorax.  One tiny
 air bubble is in the anterior mediastinum.  Note that only the upper two-
 thirds of the chest were covered.  There is no pericardial effusion or
 mediastinal hematoma.  Subcutaneous hematoma was not included in the field of
 view.

 There is no other change since earlier today in bilateral dependent opacities,
 right peribronchial consolidation, severe cardiomegaly and rib fractures.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No residual pneumothorax in the upper two-thirds of the chest.  One
 residual air bubble in the mediastinum.  No chest tube was installed.

 2.  No other change since earlier today.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   39M w/ PMhx of Ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction,
   right and left sided systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with
   unstable ventricular tachycardia,  now intubated, with hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, persistent fevers.
   # Respiratory Failure: Primarily hypoxemic.  Pt continues to improve,
   with decreasing Fi02 and NO now off. Compliance improving.  Attempted
   to wean FiO2 down to 45% from 50% but still hypoxemic so back to 50%.
   - Cont to wean Fi02 and PEEP as tolerated.  Goal Pa02>60
   - Cont. pressure support
   - d/c
d diuresis for hypernatremia/contraction alkalosis.
   - nebs
   - d/w pulm liklihood of extubation within 14 days, vs need for trach.
   F/u pulm recs.
   - raise head of bed
   - f/u final read chest CT, per pulm recs based on prelim read, no need
   to bronch.
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of scarring from ebstein
   anomaly/repairs. Suppressed ectopy w Amiodarone. Now on Metoprolol.
   - Cont. amiodarone PO 400mg tid
   - titrate up BB for HR control, increased to 50mg [**Hospital1 **].
    -added Lisionpril 2.5mg PO daily
   - likely will need EP study and possible ablation in future.  Will
   likely need ICD.
   # BP: Off pressors, now elevated BP while weaning sedation.  Added back
   on BB.
   - MAP goal >65,
   -  Wean PEEP and sedative as tolerated.
   - added on low dose ACEI
   # Fevers: Fevers to 103-104 since admission, initially considered to be
   due to aspiration PNA.  However has completed course of abz with no
   sputum production and improving pulmonary function.  Chest CT did not
   show evidence for ongoing infection. Ddx at this point includes occult
   infection (abscess, acalculous cholecystitis, sinusitis), gout,
   thermoregulatory dysfunciton after cardiac arrest/non-exposure heat
   stroke, drug fever, thyroid storm, adrenan insufficiency (although less
   likely now that not hypotensive). Not exposed to any culprit meds for
   NMS.
    Continued to spike fevers, but fever curve seems to be decreasing.
   Still on ATC tylenol, aspirin and cooling blanket.  Fem line removed
   and sent for culture with no growth.  Possible drug fever given
   persistent fever with no pos. cx data. C. diff negative. CT with PO
   contrast did not show clear source of fevers. CT sinus did have partial
   opacifications of bilaterally mastoids. CVL placed [**3-10**].
   - d/c abx yesterday per ID.

   -hold lasix gtt
   -D5W continuous + free water flushes for repletion
   # Chronic Systolic heart failure - Congestive Heart Failure: Has right
   and left sided heart failure, s/p tricuspid reconstruction and ASD
   repair.
   - hold digoxin
   - TEE and TTE
 showed poor systolic function. Done just after arrest.
   Repeat today to assess any regain of systolic funtion.
   - hold diuresis
   - appreciate Children
s congenital specialist input
   - Cr stable, add back on low dose ACEI
   # ARF: ATN, creatinine increased in setting of continued diuresis.  Cr
   much improved after holding diuresis.
   - d/ced lasix gtt
   - monitor UOP
   # Hypernatremia sodium of 155 from 148, free water defict of 7L, likely
   from combination of fevers and diuresis
   - d

   Assessment and Plan
   39M w/ PMhx of Ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction,
   right and left sided systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with
   unstable ventricular tachycardia,  now intubated, with hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, persistent fevers.
   # Respiratory Failure: Primarily hypoxemic.  Pt continues to improve,
   with decreasing Fi02 and NO now off. Compliance improving.  Attempted
   to wean FiO2 down to 45% from 50% but still hypoxemic so back to 50%.

   to bronch.
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of scarring from ebstein
   anomaly/repairs. Suppressed ectopy w Amiodarone. Now on Metoprolol.
   - Cont. amiodarone PO 400mg tid
   - titrate up BB for HR control, increased to 50mg [**Hospital1 **].
    -added Lisionpril 2.5mg PO daily
   - likely will need EP study and possible ablation in future.  Will
   likely need ICD.
   # BP: Off pressors, now elevated BP while weaning sedation.  Added back
   on BB.
   - MAP goal >65,
   -  Wean PEEP and sedative as tolerated.
   - added on low dose ACEI
   # Fevers: Fevers to 103-104 since admission, initially considered to be
   due to aspiration PNA.  However has completed course of abz with no
   sputum production and improving pulmonary function.  Chest CT did not
   show evidence for ongoing infection. Ddx at this point includes occult
   infection (abscess, acalculous cholecystitis, sinusitis), gout,
   thermoregulatory dysfunciton after cardiac arrest/non-exposure heat
   stroke, drug fever, thyroid storm, adrenan insufficiency (although less
   likely now that not hypotensive). Not exposed to any culprit meds for
   NMS.
    Continued to spike fevers, but fever curve seems to be decreasing.
   Still on ATC tylenol, aspirin and cooling blanket.  Fem line removed
   and sent for culture with no growth.  Possible drug fever given
   persistent fever with no pos. cx data. C. diff negative. CT with PO
   contrast did not show clear source of fevers. CT sinus did have partial
   opacifications of bilaterally mastoids. CVL placed [**3-10**].

   failure, presenting with palpitations which awoke him from sleep. The
   patient presented to the ED morning of [**2151-3-7**] where he was found to be
   in VT 230bpm. He began to experience chest pain, given amiodarone 150mg
   IV x 1, followed by amio gtt. He became diaphoretic, given etomidate
   and shocked with 200J, followed by vifib, becoming unresponsive and
   apneic. CPR was initiated, epinephrine x 1, CPR continued, shocked at
   360J, returning to vtach @ 240. He was intubated, returning to sinus
   rhythm, aspriating vomit; noted to have right bronchus intubation and
   ETT repositioned. Due to hypotension SBP 40's started on levophed,
   neosynephrine, and vasopressin with BP increasing to 124/77.
   Subsequently developed left pneumothroax with attempted chest tube
   placement failed, had esophageal ballon placed. Early this morning had
   two recurrent runs of a WCT for which he was treated with amiodarone
   300mg IV then with the second run received 100mg IV lidocaine with

   39 yo [**Male First Name (un) 1983**] with PMH of Ebstein's anomaly s/p reconstruction, ASD s/p
   repair ([**2136**]), LV noncompaction, biventricular heart failure, morbid
   obesity, obstructive sleep apnea
   who is in critical condition following presentation with a wide complex
   tachycardia likely originating from sites of his past intracardiac
   surgery repairs, at this time requiring vasopressor
   support and mechanical ventilation:
   1. Ventricular Tachycardia -- at this time continue current management
   with cardiopulmonary support with continuation ofamiodarone and
   lidocaine IV gtts. Monitor K and Mg levels
   with repletion as necessary. To discuss with EP attending regarding
   possible discontinuation of amiodarone and continuation of lidocaine
   gtt at this time. Once hemodynamically improving, with
   overall improvement will at that time discuss EPS with ablation
   therapy.
   ------ Protected Section ------
   Patient seen, discussed and examined with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3658**]. The etiology of
   his VT remains uncertain, likely secondary to CM, since ASD repair and
   tricuspid ring wouldn not be expected to give an RVOT type VT. Also a
   question of whether his has junctional tachycardia secondary to meds or
   SVT due to a bypass tract, which is common in Ebsteins anomaly. Cause
   of myopathy uncertain, but possibly, tachy related. He will need an EPS
   when Hemodynamically stable. He may do better in NSR so I will give
   adenosine to stop current rhythm.

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yo [**Male First Name (un) 1983**] with PMH of Ebstein's anomaly s/p reconstruction, ASD s/p
   repair ([**2136**]), LV noncompaction, biventricular heart failure, morbid
   obesity, obstructive sleep apnea
   who is in critical condition following presentation with a wide complex
   tachycardia likely originating from sites of his past intracardiac
   surgery repairs, at this time requiring vasopressor
   support and mechanical ventilation:
   1. Ventricular Tachycardia -- at this time continue current management
   with cardiopulmonary support with continuation ofamiodarone and
   lidocaine IV gtts. Monitor K and Mg levels
   with repletion as necessary. To discuss with EP attending regarding
   possible discontinuation of amiodarone and continuation of lidocaine
   gtt at this time. Once hemodynamically improving, with
   overall improvement will at that time discuss EPS with ablation
   therapy.
   ------ Protected Section ------
   Patient seen, discussed and examined with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3658**]. The etiology of
   his VT remains uncertain, likely secondary to CM, since ASD repair and
   tricuspid ring wouldn not be expected to give an RVOT type VT. Also a
   question of whether his has junctional tachycardia secondary to meds or
   SVT due to a bypass tract, which is common in Ebsteins anomaly. Cause
   of myopathy uncertain, but possibly, tachy related. He will need an EPS
   when Hemodynamically stable. He may do better in NSR so I will give
   adenosine to stop current rhythm.

 Total Gd-DTPA (Magnevist ) contrast: 0 ml (0mmol/kg)

 Complications: Patient was claustrophobic and unable to cooperate with breath
 holding.

 1) Structure: Axial dual-inversion T1-weighted images of the myocardium were
 obtained
 2) Function: Non breath-hold cine SSFP images were acquired in the left
 ventricular 2-chamber, 4-chamber, horizontal long axis, short axis slices (8-
 mm slices with 2-mm gaps), sagittal and coronal orientations of the left
 ventricular outflow tract, sagittal orientation of the right ventricular
 outflow tract, and aortic valve short axis orientations. Breath-hold real time
 SSFP images were acquired in the left ventricular 2-chamber, 4-chamber, and
 mid-papillary short axis slices.
 3) Flow: Phase-contrast cine images were obtained transverse to the aorta
 (axial plane) and main pulmonary artery (oblique plane).


 Findings:
 Structure and Function
 There was prominent epicardial and mediastinal fat. The myocardium appeared to
 have homogenous signal intensity.  The pericardial thickness was normal. There
 were no pericardial or pleural effusions. The origins of the left main and
 right coronary arteries were identified in their customary positions.  The
 indexed diameters of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta were normal.
 The main pulmonary artery diameter index was normal.  The left atrial AP
 dimension was normal.  The right and left atrial lengths in the 4-chamber view
 were moderately increased.  The coronary sinus diameter was normal. The
 inferior vena cava and hepatic veins were markedly dilated.
 The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension index was normal.  The end-
 diastolic volume index was normal.  The calculated left ventricular ejection

 fraction was mildly decreased at 42%.  The anteroseptal and inferolateral wall
 thicknesses were normal. There were prominent trabeculations from the mid to
 apical segments of the left ventricle with maximum ratio of non-compacted
 myocardium to compacted myocardium during diastole of 3.5 in the mid
 inferolateral wall. This is consistent with diagnosis of LV non-compaction.
 The left ventricular mass index was normal (excluding volume of non compacted
 ventricle). The inter-ventricular septum was flattened (D-shape) in diastole
 consistent with RV volume overload.
 The functional right ventricular end-diastolic volume index was mildly
 increased.  The calculated right ventricular ejection fraction of the
 functional RV was severely decreased at 29%. The right ventricular end-
 diastolic volume index of the structural RV (including atrialized RV) was
 severely increased.  The calculated right ventricular ejection fraction of the
 structural RV was severely decreased at 35%
 The aortic valve was tri-leaflet with normal valve area. The tricuspid valve
 had abnormalities consistent with Ebstein's anomaly with mobile leaflets, a
 mobile posterior that was markedly displaced apically. A well seated tricuspid
 annuloplasty ring was present. A signal void was seen in the anatomic right
 atrium during systole consistent with tricuspid regurgitation.

 Quantitative Flow
 There was no significant intra-cardiac shunt.  Aortic flow demonstrated mild
 aortic regurgitation.  The calculated mitral valve regurgitant fraction was
 consistent with no mitral regurgitation. The resultant effective forward LVEF
 was mildly decreased at 41%.
 The right ventricular stroke volume and pulmonic flow demonstrated no
 significant pulmonic regurgitation. Using volumetric data from the functional
 RV, there was moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Using volumetric data from the
 structural RV, there was severe tricuspid regurgitation through the tricuspid
 annulus.

 Non-Cardiac Findings
 The patient is s/p sternotomy. Also noted are slight anterior wedge
 compression fractures in the lower thoracic spine, with narrowing of
 intervening disc space, similar to previous CMR findings on [**2149-7-2**].

 Impression:
 1. Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild global left ventricular
 hypokinesis. The LVEF was mildly decreased at 42%. The effective forward LVEF
 was mildly decreased at 41%.  Prominent non-compacted left ventricular
 myocardium that meet CMR criteria for non-compaction.
 2. Mild functional right ventricular enlargement with evidence of RV volume
 overload. Severe structural RV enlargement. Severe right ventricular systolic
 dysfunction with RVEF at 29%. Severely decreased structural RV systolic
 function with RVEF at 35%.
 3. Markedly dilated inferior vena cava and hepatic veins consistent with
                                                             (Over)

 4. Abnormal and apically displaced tricuspid valve consistent with Ebstein's
 anomaly. A well seated tricuspid annuloplasty ring was present. Moderate
 tricuspid regurgitation through tricuspid leaflets of functional right
 ventricle. Severe tricuspid regurgitation through tricuspid annulus of
 structural right ventricle.
 5. Mild aortic regurgitation.
 6. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta were
 normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter index was normal.
 7. Moderate [**Hospital1 **]-atrial enlargement.
 8. No CMR evidence of residual intra-cardiac shunt. (post ASD patch repair)

   Assessment and Plan
   39M w/ PMhx of Ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction,
   right and left sided systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with
   unstable ventricular tachycardia, now extubated s/p a prolonged
   intubation for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, persistent
   fevers now trending down and persistent hypernatremia.
   # Respiratory Failure now s/p extubation: Mixed hypoxemia and
   hypercarbia.  Pt continues to wean slowly, became hypercarbic and
   hypoxemic during SBT yesterday at 0/8, however patient was unable to
   stay upright and also ETT likely too small which is making wean more
   difficult.  Pulm following and recommend extubation today with
   anesthesia at bedside given was difficult intubation.
   - Cont to wean Fi02 and PEEP as tolerated.  Goal Pa02>60
   - Cont. pressure support
   - Extubation this afternoon with pulm and anesthesia at bedside
   - Consider bronch prior to extubation.
   - cont. nebs
   - If fails extubation will discuss trach. F/u pulm recs.
   - raise head of bed
   - f/u am CXR for tube position.
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of scarring from ebstein
   anomaly/repairs. Suppressed ectopy w Amiodarone. Now on Metoprolol.
   - amiodarone decreased to 200mg tid [**3-15**] given received 10gm loading
   - titrate up BB for HR control, increased to 50mg [**Hospital1 **].
    -added Lisionpril 2.5mg PO daily
   - likely will need EP study and possible ablation in future.  Will
   likely need ICD.
   # BP: Off pressors, now elevated BP while weaning sedation.  Added back
   on BB.
   - MAP goal >65,
   -  Wean PEEP and sedative as tolerated.
   - added on low dose ACEI
   # Fevers: Fevers to 103-104 since admission, initially considered to be
   due to aspiration PNA.  However has completed course of abx with no
   sputum production and improving pulmonary function.  Chest CT did not
   show evidence for ongoing infection. Ddx at this point includes occult
   infection (abscess, acalculous cholecystitis, sinusitis), gout,
   thermoregulatory dysfunciton after cardiac arrest/non-exposure heat
   stroke, drug fever, thyroid storm, adrenal insufficiency (although less
   likely now that not hypotensive). Not exposed to any culprit meds for
   NMS.  All culture data negative thus far.  Now with increasing
   secretions.
    Continued to spike fevers.  Still on ATC tylenol, aspirin and cooling
   blanket.  Fem line removed and sent for culture with no growth.
   Possible drug fever given persistent fever with no pos. cx data. C.
   diff negative. CT with PO contrast did not show clear source of fevers.
   CT sinus did have partial opacifications of bilaterally mastoids. CVL
   placed [**3-10**].

   # Respiratory Failure
 now resolved: Initially mixed hypoxemia and
   hypercarbia. Patient currently
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of scarring from ebstein
   anomaly/repairs. Initially Amiodarone loaded and continued outpatient
   metoprolol. Decreased Amiodarone dose to 200 mg PO TID as has received
   10 g loading dose. Beta blocker had to be titrated down in the setting
   of bradycardia. Plan is for EP study today with ICD placement.
   - NPO for EP study today
   # BP: Patient without history of hypertension. On beta blocker as an
   outpatient as well as Lisinopril. Yesterday patient with low blood
   pressures.
   -          lower beta blocker dose
   -          keep ACEi at current dose, would like to uptitrate as
   tolerated when able
   # Fever- now resolved : Patient initially with Fevers to 103-104,
   initially considered to be due to aspiration PNA.  Patient completed
   course of abx with no sputum production and improving pulmonary
   function.  Chest CT did not show evidence for ongoing infection. Ddx
   for previous fever included occult infection (abscess, acalculous
   cholecystitis, sinusitis), gout, thermoregulatory dysfunciton after
   cardiac arrest/non-exposure heat stroke, drug fever, thyroid storm,
   adrenal insufficiency (although less likely now that not hypotensive).
   Not exposed to any culprit meds for NMS.  All culture data negative
   thus far.
   Fem line removed and sent for culture with no growth.  Possible drug
   fever given persistent fever with no pos. cx data. C. diff negative. CT
   with PO contrast did not show clear source of fevers. CT sinus did have
   partial opacifications of bilaterally mastoids. CVL placed [**3-10**].
   Antibioitcs were discontinued as per ID reccomendations. Blood cultures
   NGTD, [**Last Name (un) **] stim test normal, TSH normal. Fungal blood cultures no
   growth to date.
   .
   # Hypernatremia now resolved -  Patient treated with free water flushes
   through NG tube as well as d5W now with normal sodium discontinued free
   water.
   -          cont to monitor Na
   # Chronic Systolic heart failure - Congestive Heart Failure: Echo s/p
   arrest demonstrated right and left sided heart failure, s/p tricuspid
   reconstruction and ASD repair. Repeat echocardiogram on [**2151-3-15**]
   demonstrates marked right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall
   hypokinesis. Normal left ventricular cavity size with low normal
   systolic function. Well seated tricuspid annuloplasty ring with
   increased gradient. Patient is seen at Children
s congenital heart
   center.
   - hold digoxin
   - hold diuresis for now , would restart on discharge
   - continue low dose ACEi
   .
   # Acute renal failure: likely ATN, Creatinine max to 3.2 during this
   admission, creatinine improved now  to 1.1. Likely ATN in the setting
   of VF arrest.
   -          monitor UOP
   -          renally dose medications
   -          avoid nephrotoxins
   # Nutrition
 patient passed speech and swallow evaluation yesterday.
   Taking good PO.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Multifactorial from shock liver, heart failure (acute
   after arrest) and Amiodarone continuing to improve daily.
   - continue to trend LFTs
   #Gout: R knee swollen, concerning for gout flare, joint tapped, no
   crystals visualized.  Attempted to tap knee again however tap was dry.
   Not currently getting treated with any agents, fever has broken and

   ABG: 7.40 / 36 / 83 /  / -1   Values as of [**2151-3-9**] 03:44 AM
   Assessment and Plan
   39M w/ PMhx of Ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction,
   right and left sided systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with
   unstable ventricular tachycardia, s/p resuscitation with return to
   sinus tachycardia, now intubated, with hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of scarring from ebstein
   anomaly/repairs. Currently receiving amiodarone IV, remains in sinus
   tachycardia s/p resuscitation.  Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated, likely
   related to CPR and cardioversion. AM 1/26 episodes of SVT with rate in
   120s to 130s, improved with amio bolus x 2 and lido gtt, now off lido.
   -likely need VT albation
   -continue amiodarone gtt for now, but careful monitoring of LFTs
   -electrophysiology consult
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial origin possibling include
   low cardiac output, volume overload, aspiration PNA, sepsis. No shunt
   seen on TEE bubble study. Difficulty oxygenating until addition of
   nitric oxide on [**3-8**], now on Fi02 70% and PEEP of 20. PE ruled out with
   CTA. CT initially showed left pneumothorax, but f/u CT showed
   resolution after chest tube attempt. Also CT and CXRs showing
   right-sided possible aspiration PNA, which is consistent w/ reported
   aspiration during intubation. Being ventilated according to ARDS net
   protocol.
   -pulm recs to stop paralytic- Nimbex, decrease FIO2 to 60%, and start
   weaning nitric oxide
   -continuing lasix gtt, improved UO
   -ARDS net protocol
   -nebs
   - [**Hospital1 **] CXR to eval for PTX
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially secondary to ventricular tachycardia, and
   response to sedatives s/p intubation. Initially on three pressors but
   now only on levophed and vasopressin.  Will try to minimize PEEP to
   maximize venous return. Likely due to both cardiogenic and septic
   shock.
   - Pressors as needed
   - Fluids as neded, but currently on lasix gtt for volume overload
   - consider Swan-Ganz placement to evaluate pressures/volumes
   .
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis/fever/right lobe infiltrate- likely aspiration
   PNA, witnessed emesis during intubation. Continued to be febrile
   overnight and this morning. Vanco level was low, dose increased
   - MRSA screen and precautions
   - Continue vanco and zosyn, day 3 on
   - Following vanco levels
   - follow sputum, urine, and blood cxs
   .
   # Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Has right and left sided
   heart failure, s/p tricuspid reconstruction and ASD repair. Will hold
   metoprolol, lisinopril, lasix, and digoxin in setting of hypotension.
   - hold metoprolol, lisinopril, digoxin
   - TEE and TTE
 showed poor systolic function, EF not estimated
   - consider diurese w lasix drip to goal -500 cc / 24 hours
   .
   # ARF: Cr increased to 3.2. Likely [**3-15**] hypotension. Prerenal by urine
   lytes. UO now improved
   - monitor UOP
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Transaminitis: LFTs increased to 1000s, likely from shock liver, and
   CHF. Also has abdominal extension.
   - monitor liver function
   - may need to stop amio
   - AXR done on [**3-8**]- no free air, no obstruction seen (wet read)
   .
   # Family dynamics: family concerned about care of pt in the hospital,
   mother wants transfer to [**Name (NI) 49**],
   - social work consult
   - patient relations/advocate consults
   - Children
s congenital specialist contact[**Name (NI) **]- no other recs
   .
   #Gout: holding allopurinol and colchicine
   .

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Plan for bronchoscopy and hope for extubation later today.  Have
   reviewed work-up to date for unexplained fever. Patient is acutely ill
   but does not appear toxic. Drug fever still a likely possibility given
   negative work-up.  Will hold antibiotics.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   critical care for ventilator management/respiratory failure.

   support and mechanical ventilation:
   1. Ventricular Tachycardia -- at this time continue current management
   with cardiopulmonary support with continuation ofamiodarone and
   lidocaine IV gtts. Monitor K and Mg levels
   with repletion as necessary. To discuss with EP attending regarding
   possible discontinuation of amiodarone and continuation of lidocaine
   gtt at this time. Once hemodynamically improving, with
   overall improvement will at that time discuss EPS with ablation
   therapy.

 AP CHEST, 7:48 AM, ON [**3-7**].

 HISTORY:  Ventricular tachycardia.  Intubated.  Check ET tube placement.

 COMPARISON:  AP chest compared to [**2-21**] and [**2150-3-6**]:

 Some of the substantial increase in upper mediastinal caliber between [**2-21**] and today could be due to supine positioning, but the change in caliber and
 in the contours of the right side of the mediastinum suggests more is
 involved, including at least substantial increase in caliber of mediastinal
 veins or alternatively the aorta and possibly development of mediastinal
 hematoma.  As such, possibility of hemodynamically significant pericardial
 effusion or aortic dissection that needs to be excluded.

 Endotracheal tube has been withdrawn from the right main bronchus to the
 thoracic inlet, nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  No
 radiopaque central venous catheter is seen.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Partial obscuration of the border of
 the left heart could be divided with change in its geometry, due to worsening
 cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion or, alternatively new consolidation
 of atelectasis in the lingula.  No pneumothorax.

 Findings and their clinical significance were discussed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3001**] with the
 physician caregiver [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 33400**] 8:15 a.m. this morning.

   anomaly/repairs. Initially Amiodarone loaded and continued outpatient
   metoprolol. Decreased Amiodarone dose to 200 mg PO TID as has received
   10 g loading dose. Beta blocker had to be titrated down in the setting
   of bradycardia. Plan is for EP study with ICD placement at some point,
   however given that recently had fever and that patient has not been out
   of bed, may need repeat intubation will hold on procedure for a few
   days. Spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] concerning this
   -          f/u daily EP recs
   -          .
   # BP: Patient without history of hypertension. On beta blocker as an
   outpatient as well as Lisinopril. Yesterday patient with low blood
   pressures.
   -          lower beta blocker dose
   -          keep ACEi at current dose, would like to uptitrate as
   tolerated when able
   # Fever- now resolved : Patient initially with Fevers to 103-104,
   initially considered to be due to aspiration PNA.  Patient completed
   course of abx with no sputum production and improving pulmonary
   function.  Chest CT did not show evidence for ongoing infection. Ddx
   for previous fever included occult infection (abscess, acalculous
   cholecystitis, sinusitis), gout, thermoregulatory dysfunciton after
   cardiac arrest/non-exposure heat stroke, drug fever, thyroid storm,
   adrenal insufficiency (although less likely now that not hypotensive).
   Not exposed to any culprit meds for NMS.  All culture data negative
   thus far.
   Fem line removed and sent for culture with no growth.  Possible drug
   fever given persistent fever with no pos. cx data. C. diff negative. CT
   with PO contrast did not show clear source of fevers. CT sinus did have
   partial opacifications of bilaterally mastoids. CVL placed [**3-10**].
   Antibioitcs were discontinued as per ID reccomendations. Blood cultures
   NGTD, [**Last Name (un) **] stim test normal, TSH normal. Fungal blood cultures no
   growth to date.
   .
   # Hypernatremia now resolved -  Patient treated with free water flushes
   through NG tube as well as d5W now with normal sodium discontinued free
   water.
   -          cont to monitor Na
   # Chronic Systolic heart failure - Congestive Heart Failure: Echo s/p
   arrest demonstrated right and left sided heart failure, s/p tricuspid
   reconstruction and ASD repair. Repeat echocardiogram on [**2151-3-15**]
   demonstrates marked right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall
   hypokinesis. Normal left ventricular cavity size with low normal
   systolic function. Well seated tricuspid annuloplasty ring with
   increased gradient. Patient is seen at Children
s congenital heart
   center.
   - hold digoxin

   1. Normal left ventricular cavity size with globally depressed systolic
   function. The LVEF was severely decreased at 28%. No MR evidence of
   prior myocardial scarring/infarction although images technically
   suboptimal. Prominent non-compacted left ventricular myocardium that
   meet CMR criteria for non-compaction.
   2. Abnormal and apically displaced tricuspid valve consistent with
   Ebstein's anomaly. A tricuspid annulplasty ring was present. Moderately
   depressed systolic function of the functional right ventricle with RVEF
   at 25%. Abnormal septal motion consistent with right ventricular
   pressure / volume overload. Markedly dilated inferior vena cava and
   hepatic veins consistent with elevated
   right atrial pressure.
   3. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate-to-severe tricuspid
   regurgitation through tricuspid leaflets of functional right ventricle.
   Severe tricuspid regurgitation through tricuspid annulus of structural

   Echocardiogram: (Date: [**2149-5-7**]), The left atrium is mildly dilated. The
   right atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
   or color Doppler. There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis
   (the bsala lateral wall moves best). There is no ventricular septal
   defect. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. Right
   ventricular systolic function appears severely depressed. There is
   abnormal/paradoxical septal motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
   aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. A tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is present. The gradients are
   higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. Moderate [2+]
   tricuspid regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the

   Assessment and Plan
   39M w/ PMhx of Ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction,
   right and left sided systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with
   unstable ventricular tachycardia, s/p resuscitation with return to
   sinus tachycardia, now intubated, with hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of scarring from ebstein
   anomaly/repairs. Currently receiving amiodarone IV, remains in sinus
   tachycardia s/p resuscitation.  Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated, likely
   related to CPR and cardioversion. This AM had sevarel episodes of what
   may have been VT with rate in 120s to 130s, improved with amio bolus
   and increased gtt (however, now also increased LFTs). Required addition
   of lidocaine gtt.
   -likely need VT albation
   -continue amiodarone gtt for now, but careful monitoring of LFTs
   -electrophysiology consult
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial origin possibling include
   low cardiac output, volume overload, R
L shunting, aspiration PNA,
   sepsis. Difficulty oxygenating with Fi02 100% and increased PEEP. PE
   ruled out with CTA. CT initially showed left pneumothorax, but f/u CT
   showed resolution after chest tube attempt. Also CT and CXRs showing
   right-sided possible aspiration PNA, which is consistent w reported
   aspiration during intubation. Being ventilated according to ARDS net
   protocol.  [**Month (only) 11**] have reopened ASD repair, causing shunt.
   -consider TEE with bubble study to evaluate for ASD
   -consider Swan-Ganz catheter to check oxygen saturation in four
   [**Doctor Last Name 135**] to evaluate for right to left shunt, however, likely not
   useful at this point given mixture of cardiogenic/septic physiology
   -giving lasix this AM at increased dose, so far little improvement
   -ARDS net protocol
   -cisatracurium (Nimbex) as paralytic [**Doctor Last Name 23**]
   -nebs
   -if still poor saturation, will consider inhaled nitrous oxide
   -pulm following- appreciate recs
   - [**Hospital1 **] CXR to eval for PTX
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially secondary to ventricular tachycardia, and
   response to sedatives s/p intubation. Initially on three pressors but
   now only on levophed and vasopressin, still requiring dopa
   intermittently.  Will try to minimize PEEP to maximize venous return.
   may possibly be from decompensated heart failure.  Likely has
   combination of cardiogenic shock and septic shock.
   - Pressors as needed
   - Fluids as neded, currently diuresing for volume overload
   - consider Swan-Ganz placement to evaluate pressures/volumes
   .
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis/fever/right lobe infiltrate- likely aspiration
   PNA, witnessed emesis during intubation.
   - MRSA screen and precautions
   - Continue vanco and zosyn, day 2 on
   - Check AM trough on [**3-9**]
   .
   # Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Has right and left sided
   heart failure, s/p tricuspid reconstruction and ASD repair. Will hold
   metoprolol, lisinopril, lasix, and digoxin in setting of hypotension.
   - hold metoprolol, lisinopril, digoxin
   - TEE
   - consider diurese w lasix drip to goal -500 cc / 24 hours, with
   respiratory cautions
   .
   # ARF: Cr increased to 2.6. Likely [**3-15**] hypotension. Possible ATN. Low
   UOP.
   - monitor UOP
   - check urine lytes
   - consider renal consult for ? ultrafiltration for volume overload
   .
   # Transaminitis: LFTs increased, may be from shock liver, and/or CHF.
   Also has abdominal extension.
   - monitor liver function
   - may need to stop amio
   - check AXR to eval for ileus
   .
   # Family dynamics: family concerned about care of pt in the hospital,
   mother wants transfer to [**Name (NI) 49**]
   - social work consult
   - consider patient relations/advocate consults
   - likely benefit from family meeting today

   39M w/ PMhx of Ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction,
   right and left sided systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with
   unstable ventricular tachycardia,  now intubated, with hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, persistent fevers.
   # Respiratory Failure: Mixed hypoxemia and hypercarbia.  Pt continues
   to wean slowly, became hypercarbic and hypoxemic during SBT yesterday
   at 0/8, however patient was unable to stay upright and also ETT likely
   too small which is making wean more difficult.  Pulm following and
   recommend extubation today with anesthesia at bedside given was
   difficult intubation.
   - Cont to wean Fi02 and PEEP as tolerated.  Goal Pa02>60
   - Cont. pressure support
   - Extubation this afternoon with pulm and anesthesia at bedside
   - Consider bronch prior to extubation.
   - cont. nebs
   - If fails extubation will discuss trach. F/u pulm recs.
   - raise head of bed
   - f/u am CXR for tube position.
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of scarring from ebstein
   anomaly/repairs. Suppressed ectopy w Amiodarone. Now on Metoprolol.
   - amiodarone decreased to 200mg tid [**3-15**] given received 10gm loading
   - titrate up BB for HR control, increased to 50mg [**Hospital1 **].
    -added Lisionpril 2.5mg PO daily
   - likely will need EP study and possible ablation in future.  Will

   -  Wean PEEP and sedative as tolerated.
   - added on low dose ACEI
   # Fevers: Fevers to 103-104 since admission, initially considered to be
   due to aspiration PNA.  However has completed course of abx with no
   sputum production and improving pulmonary function.  Chest CT did not
   show evidence for ongoing infection. Ddx at this point includes occult
   infection (abscess, acalculous cholecystitis, sinusitis), gout,
   thermoregulatory dysfunciton after cardiac arrest/non-exposure heat
   stroke, drug fever, thyroid storm, adrenal insufficiency (although less
   likely now that not hypotensive). Not exposed to any culprit meds for
   NMS.  All culture data negative thus far.  Now with increasing
   secretions.
    Continued to spike fevers.  Still on ATC tylenol, aspirin and cooling
   blanket.  Fem line removed and sent for culture with no growth.
   Possible drug fever given persistent fever with no pos. cx data. C.
   diff negative. CT with PO contrast did not show clear source of fevers.
   CT sinus did have partial opacifications of bilaterally mastoids. CVL
   placed [**3-10**].

   Assessment and Plan
   39M w/ PMhx of Ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction,
   right and left sided systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with
   unstable ventricular tachycardia,  now intubated, with hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, persistent fevers.
   # Respiratory Failure: Mixed hypoxemia and hypercarbia.  Pt continues
   to wean slowly, became hypercarbic and hypoxemic during SBT yesterday
   at 0/8, however patient was unable to stay upright and also ETT likely
   too small which is making wean more difficult.  Pulm following and
   recommend extubation today with anesthesia at bedside given was
   difficult intubation.
   - Cont to wean Fi02 and PEEP as tolerated.  Goal Pa02>60
   - Cont. pressure support
   - Extubation this afternoon with pulm and anesthesia at bedside
   - Consider bronch prior to extubation.
   - cont. nebs
   - If fails extubation will discuss trach. F/u pulm recs.
   - raise head of bed
   - f/u am CXR for tube position.
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of scarring from ebstein
   anomaly/repairs. Suppressed ectopy w Amiodarone. Now on Metoprolol.
   - amiodarone decreased to 200mg tid [**3-15**] given received 10gm loading
   - titrate up BB for HR control, increased to 50mg [**Hospital1 **].
    -added Lisionpril 2.5mg PO daily
   - likely will need EP study and possible ablation in future.  Will
   likely need ICD.
   # BP: Off pressors, now elevated BP while weaning sedation.  Added back
   on BB.
   - MAP goal >65,
   -  Wean PEEP and sedative as tolerated.
   - added on low dose ACEI
   # Fevers: Fevers to 103-104 since admission, initially considered to be
   due to aspiration PNA.  However has completed course of abx with no
   sputum production and improving pulmonary function.  Chest CT did not
   show evidence for ongoing infection. Ddx at this point includes occult
   infection (abscess, acalculous cholecystitis, sinusitis), gout,
   thermoregulatory dysfunciton after cardiac arrest/non-exposure heat
   stroke, drug fever, thyroid storm, adrenal insufficiency (although less
   likely now that not hypotensive). Not exposed to any culprit meds for
   NMS.  All culture data negative thus far.  Now with increasing
   secretions.
    Continued to spike fevers.  Still on ATC tylenol, aspirin and cooling
   blanket.  Fem line removed and sent for culture with no growth.
   Possible drug fever given persistent fever with no pos. cx data. C.

   Assessment and Plan
   39M w/ PMhx of Ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction,
   right and left sided systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with
   unstable ventricular tachycardia s/p intubation and extubation, plan
   for EP procedure with ventricular fibrillation ablation as well as ICD
   placement.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 now resolved: Initially mixed hypoxemia and
   hypercarbia. Patient with OSA on CPAP at home at night.
   - continue nighttime CPAP
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of scarring from ebstein
   anomaly/repairs. Initially Amiodarone loaded and continued outpatient
   metoprolol. Decreased Amiodarone dose to 200 mg PO TID as has received
   10 g loading dose. Beta blocker had to be titrated down in the setting
   of bradycardia. Plan is for EP study today with ICD placement.
   - NPO for EP study today
   # BP: Patient without history of hypertension. On beta blocker as an
   outpatient as well as Lisinopril. Yesterday patient with low blood
   pressures.
   -          lower beta blocker dose
   -          keep ACEi at current dose, would like to uptitrate as
   tolerated when able
   # Fever- now resolved : Patient initially with Fevers to 103-104,
   initially considered to be due to aspiration PNA.  Patient completed
   course of abx with no sputum production and improving pulmonary
   function.  Chest CT did not show evidence for ongoing infection. Ddx
   for previous fever included occult infection (abscess, acalculous
   cholecystitis, sinusitis), gout, thermoregulatory dysfunciton after
   cardiac arrest/non-exposure heat stroke, drug fever, thyroid storm,
   adrenal insufficiency (although less likely now that not hypotensive).
   Not exposed to any culprit meds for NMS.  All culture data negative
   thus far.
   Fem line removed and sent for culture with no growth.  Possible drug
   fever given persistent fever with no pos. cx data. C. diff negative. CT
   with PO contrast did not show clear source of fevers. CT sinus did have
   partial opacifications of bilaterally mastoids. CVL placed [**3-10**].
   Antibioitcs were discontinued as per ID reccomendations. Blood cultures
   NGTD, [**Last Name (un) **] stim test normal, TSH normal. Fungal blood cultures no
   growth to date.
   .
   # Hypernatremia now resolved -  Patient treated with free water flushes
   through NG tube as well as d5W now with normal sodium discontinued free
   water.
   -          cont to monitor Na
   # Chronic Systolic heart failure - Congestive Heart Failure: Echo s/p
   arrest demonstrated right and left sided heart failure, s/p tricuspid
   reconstruction and ASD repair. Repeat echocardiogram on [**2151-3-15**]
   demonstrates marked right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall
   hypokinesis. Normal left ventricular cavity size with low normal
   systolic function. Well seated tricuspid annuloplasty ring with
   increased gradient. Patient is seen at Children
s congenital heart
   center.
   - hold digoxin
   - hold diuresis for now , would restart on discharge
   - continue low dose ACEi
   .
   # Acute renal failure: likely ATN, Creatinine max to 3.2 during this
   admission, creatinine improved now  to 1.1. Likely ATN in the setting
   of VF arrest.
   -          monitor UOP
   -          renally dose medications
   -          avoid nephrotoxins
   # Nutrition
 patient passed speech and swallow evaluation yesterday.
   Taking good PO.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Multifactorial from shock liver, heart failure (acute
   after arrest) and Amiodarone continuing to improve daily.
   - continue to trend LFTs
   #Gout: R knee swollen, concerning for gout flare, joint tapped, no
   crystals visualized.  Attempted to tap knee again however tap was dry.
   Not currently getting treated with any agents, fever has broken and
   swelling improved.

   thermoregulatory dysfunciton after cardiac arrest/non-exposure heat
   stroke, drug fever, thyroid storm, adrenan insufficiency (although less
   likely now that not hypotensive). Not exposed to any culprit meds for
   NMS.
    Continued to spike fevers, but fever curve seems to be decreasing.
   Still on ATC tylenol, aspirin and cooling blanket.  Fem line removed

   right and left sided systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with
   unstable ventricular tachycardia, now extubated s/p a prolonged
   intubation for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, persistent
   fevers now trending down and persistent hypernatremia.
   # Respiratory Failure now s/p extubation: Mixed hypoxemia and
   hypercarbia.  Pt was extubated yesterday without complication.  MS
   today alert and interactive.  Sats stable on 4L, high flow.  Likely a
   component of OSA contributing to patient

   # Fevers: Fevers to 103-104 since admission, initially considered to be
   due to aspiration PNA.  However has completed course of abx with no
   sputum production and improving pulmonary function.  Chest CT did not
   show evidence for ongoing infection. Ddx at this point includes occult
   infection (abscess, acalculous cholecystitis, sinusitis), gout,
   thermoregulatory dysfunciton after cardiac arrest/non-exposure heat
   stroke, drug fever, thyroid storm, adrenal insufficiency (although less
   likely now that not hypotensive). Not exposed to any culprit meds for
   NMS.  All culture data negative thus far.  Now with increasing
   secretions.
    Continued to spike fevers.  Still on ATC tylenol, aspirin and cooling
   blanket.  Fem line removed and sent for culture with no growth.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Doing well post extubation. Also now afebrile. Continue management for
   chronic hypoventilation syndrome. Will review with EP for continuation
   of amiodarone given young age and baseline pulmonary disease.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 25 minutes.

 INDICATION:  39-year-old male with congenital heart disease, intubated after
 VT arrest.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most reason CXR dated [**2151-3-14**].

 PORTABLE CHEST:  There has been no change in the appearance of the enlarged
 cardiac silhouette with some persistent retrocardiac atelectasis. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The sternotomy wires remain intact and a
 right internal jugular central venous line is unchanged in position.
 The endotracheal tube has been partially withdrawn, now terminating 8 cm above
 the carina. A nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach.

 IMPRESSION:  1. Endotracheal tube partially withdrawn, now 8 cm above the
 carina. 2. Unchanged appearence of cardiac silhouette and mild retrocardiac
 atelectasis.

 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): RSRc SAT [**2151-3-13**] 8:48 PM
  Progression of opacification of all the nasal sinuses.  New partial bilateral
  mastoid air cell opacification.  No definite osseous destruction
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  39-year-old male intubated, with persistent fevers.  Evaluate for
 sinusitis.

 COMPARISON:  None available in the [**Hospital1 99**] PACS.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial imaging was performed through the paranasal sinuses without
 IV contrast.  Coronal and standard tissue algorithm reformations were
 provided.

 CT SINUSES WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is bilateral extensive opacification of
 the maxillary sinuses, sphenoid sinuses, ethmoid sinuses, and frontal sinuses.
 Although sphenoid sinus opacification can be seen in the setting of
 intubation, involvement of the remainder of the paranasal sinus system
 extensively, especially the frontal sinuses, is suggestive of acute sinusitis.
 Some of the areas of opacification are dense and can be due to inspisatted or
 proteniceous secretions or related to fungal etiology, if appropriate. There
 is demineralization fo the ethmoid septae and cribriform plates of ethmoid.
 There is partial opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally.  These
 findings are more extensive than in the head CT 6 days prior.  Soft tissues
 are grossly unremarkable but not completely assessed.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Progression of opacification of maxillary, sphenoid, ethmoid and frontal
 sinuses, with aerosolized secretions suggestive of acute sinusitis along with
 a chronic component. Fungal etiology cannot eb completely excluded, if
 clinically appropriate history is present.

 2.  New partial opacification of mastoid air cells.

 INDICATION:  39-year-old male with congenital heart disease, history of lower
 extremity DVT and recent leg swelling and intracranial abscess.  Now with VT
 and needs anticoagulation.  Rule out intracranial pathology.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain without
 contrast material.  Subsequently, rapid axial imaging was performed through
 the brain during infusion of Omnipaque intravenous contrast material.  Images
 were processed on a separate workstation with display of curved reformats,
 volume-rendered images, and maximum intensity projection images.

 COMPARISON:  No prior study available for comparison.

 FINDINGS:

 HEAD CT:  There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect,
 or infarction.  Of note, there is a low-attenuation area in the right
 occipital pole, consistent with encephalomalacia with an associated ex vacuo
 enlargement of the right lateral ventricle trigone, most likely related to
 prior insult.

 Air-fluid levels in the paranasal sinuses is noted and likely reflective of
 the patient's intubated status.

 HEAD CTA:  The carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are
 patent without evidence of stenosis.  There is no evidence of aneurysm
 formation or other vascular abnormality.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute intracranial pathology.

 2.  Encephalomalacia of the right occipital pole with associated ex vacuo
 dilatation of the right lateral ventricular occipital [**Doctor Last Name 218**] suggestive of prior

   Assessment and Plan
   39M w/ PMhx of Ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction,
   right and left sided systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with
   unstable ventricular tachycardia,  now intubated, with hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, persistent fevers.
   # Respiratory Failure now s/p extubation: Mixed hypoxemia and
   hypercarbia.  Pt continues to wean slowly, became hypercarbic and
   hypoxemic during SBT yesterday at 0/8, however patient was unable to
   stay upright and also ETT likely too small which is making wean more
   difficult.  Pulm following and recommend extubation today with
   anesthesia at bedside given was difficult intubation.
   - Cont to wean Fi02 and PEEP as tolerated.  Goal Pa02>60
   - Cont. pressure support
   - Extubation this afternoon with pulm and anesthesia at bedside
   - Consider bronch prior to extubation.
   - cont. nebs
   - If fails extubation will discuss trach. F/u pulm recs.
   - raise head of bed
   - f/u am CXR for tube position.
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of scarring from ebstein
   anomaly/repairs. Suppressed ectopy w Amiodarone. Now on Metoprolol.
   - amiodarone decreased to 200mg tid [**3-15**] given received 10gm loading
   - titrate up BB for HR control, increased to 50mg [**Hospital1 **].
    -added Lisionpril 2.5mg PO daily
   - likely will need EP study and possible ablation in future.  Will
   likely need ICD.
   # BP: Off pressors, now elevated BP while weaning sedation.  Added back
   on BB.
   - MAP goal >65,
   -  Wean PEEP and sedative as tolerated.
   - added on low dose ACEI
   # Fevers: Fevers to 103-104 since admission, initially considered to be
   due to aspiration PNA.  However has completed course of abx with no
   sputum production and improving pulmonary function.  Chest CT did not
   show evidence for ongoing infection. Ddx at this point includes occult
   infection (abscess, acalculous cholecystitis, sinusitis), gout,
   thermoregulatory dysfunciton after cardiac arrest/non-exposure heat
   stroke, drug fever, thyroid storm, adrenal insufficiency (although less
   likely now that not hypotensive). Not exposed to any culprit meds for
   NMS.  All culture data negative thus far.  Now with increasing
   secretions.
    Continued to spike fevers.  Still on ATC tylenol, aspirin and cooling
   blanket.  Fem line removed and sent for culture with no growth.
   Possible drug fever given persistent fever with no pos. cx data. C.
   diff negative. CT with PO contrast did not show clear source of fevers.
   CT sinus did have partial opacifications of bilaterally mastoids. CVL
   placed [**3-10**].
   - d/c abx per ID.
   - ID following, appreciate their recs
   - Check mycolytic blood cultures, pending
   - blood cultures NGTD, urine small growth GPC, sputum is oral flora.
   Continue to monitor.
   - Repeat sputum given inc. secretions
   - Tylenol 650 qid standing for fever, standing ASA 325 PO qid
   - [**Last Name (un) **] stim test normal
   - follow LFTs, CK, TSH normal
   # Hypernatremia -  likely in setting of diuresis. Free water deficit
   initially 8L, improving with inc. free water flushes and D5.
   -hold lasix gtt
   -D5W continuous + free water flushes for repletion
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Chronic Systolic heart failure - Congestive Heart Failure: Has right
   and left sided heart failure, s/p tricuspid reconstruction and ASD
   repair.
   - hold digoxin
   - TEE and TTE
 showed poor systolic function. Done just after arrest.
   Repeat yesterday showed improved systolic function with EF 50%
   - hold diuresis
   - appreciate Children
s congenital specialist input
   - Cr improving, add back on low dose ACEI
   # ARF: ATN, creatinine increased in setting of continued diuresis.  Cr
   much improved after holding diuresis.
   - d/ced lasix gtt
   - monitor UOP
   # Hypernatremia sodium of 155 from 148, free water defict of 7L, likely
   from combination of fevers and diuresis
   - d
ed lasix gtt
   - start D5W at 100ml/hr- then will reevaluate Na this PM
   # Bowel motility/nutrition
 Monitor for improvement after lightening
   fentanyl
   - Bowel regimen on hold given now with diarrhea
   - Continue TF
   - f/u any nutrition recs
   # Transaminitis: Multifactorial from shock liver, CHF and amiodarone.
   Improving
   - monitor LFTs given amio restarted
   #Gout: R knee swollen, concerning for gout flare, joint tapped, no
   crystals visualized.  Rheum following.  Holding allopurinol and
   colchicines given ARF
   -re-tap knee yesterday without fluid.
   - Cont. to monitor.
   FEN:  agressively replete lytes, treat hypernatremia with free water

   Date of service: [**2151-3-8**]
   Initial consultation: CCU
   History of present illness: 39 y/o male with history of Ebstein anomaly
   of the tricuspid valve and ASD s/p TV reconstruction and primary ASD
   closure [**3-/2136**], right and left sided congestive heart failure, known poor
   medical compliance (has missed various f/u appointments at CHB with Dr
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3670**], and at [**Hospital1 1**] with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3671**], who presented to the [**Hospital1 1**] ED
   with palpitations which awoke him from sleep the morning of [**2151-3-7**]. He
   was found to be in VT 230bpm. He began to experience chest pain, given
   amiodarone 150mg IV x 1, followed by amio gtt. He became diaphoretic,
   given etomidate and shocked with 200J, followed by vifib, becoming
   unresponsive and apneic. CPR was initiated, epinephrine x 1, CPR
   continued, shocked at 360J, returning to vtach @ 240. He was intubated,
   returning to sinus rhythm, aspriating vomit; noted to have right
   bronchus intubation and ETT repositioned. Due to hypotension SBP 40's
   started on levophed, neosynephrine, and vasopressin with BP increasing
   to 124/77.  Subsequently developed left pneumothroax with attempted
   chest tube placement failed, had esophageal ballon placed. Early this
   morning had two recurrent runs of a WCT for which he was treated with
   amiodarone 300mg IV then with the second run received 100mg IV
   lidocaine with initiation of lidocaine gtt.
   Currently on vasopressin and norepinephrine with SBP 100s, on broad
   spectrum antibiotics for aspiration PNA (temp 104 F), on iNO
   to optimize V/Q mismatch. Initially found to have pneumothorax post rib
   fractures from chest compressions, resolved on repeat chest CT.
   EP consulted: etiology of VT uncertain, likely secondary to CMP, since
   ASD repair and TV ring would not be expected to give RVOT type VT. Also
   ? junctional tachycardia secondary to medications vs SVT due to bypass
   tract. EP recommended 1) EPS when stable 2) Stop lidocaine 3) Adenosine
   to treat ongoing SVT (unsuccesful).
   BACH team consulted for assistance in management.
   Past medical history: 1)    Ebstein anomaly of the tricuspid valve and
   atrial septal defect

   volume of 391.15 cc and a right ejection fraction of 36.6%. ? LV
   non-compaction. Mod-severe tricuspid regurgitation.
   d)            Exercise test performed at CHB [**2149-7-2**] (bicycle): able
   to exercise for 8.72 minutes. Peak VO2 12.6 ml/Kg. Peak RER 1.09. Able
   to increase his heart rate appropriately with exercise and there was
   evidence of mild restrictive obstructive lung disease on his baseline
   spirometry. Peak heart rate was 140 bpm.
   2)            Temporal brain abscess diagnosed age 8 after dental
   procedure treated with antibiotics at CHB.
   3)            OSA, does not wear CPAP machine on a regular basis.
   4)            Recurrent lower extremity cellulitis requiring many
   hospital admissions for IV antibiotics.

   tricuspid regurgitation. Severe right ventricular cavity enlargement
   with depressed biventricular systolic function.
   TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Systolic performance could not

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yo male with history of Ebstein's anomaly and ASD s/p TV
   reconstruction and primary ASD closure [**2136**], LV noncompaction,
   biventricular heart failure, moderate-severe tricuspid regurgitation,
   morbid obesity, OSA, who presented on [**3-7**] with unstable ventricular
   tachycardia s/p resuscitation, who is now critically ill, intubated, on
   pressors, on broad spectrum antibiotics for aspiration PNA, and in
   ARDS with difficulty oxygenating, increased PEEP requiring iNO.
   1) Biventricular heart failure with tricuspid regurgitation.
   - His fluid status is difficult to assess given his body habitus, he is
   grossly positive by I/O. Nevertheless, would not aggressively diurese
   given his ongoing infection.
   - PA line monitoring would be ideal, although insertion of a neck line
   may be problem[**Name (NI) **] in this morbidly obese patient.
   - He has not been considered a surgical candidate for a re-do TV
   reconstruction in the past given his comorbidities and non-compliance.
   - Wean pressors as tolerated.
   2) Ventricular tachycardia, possibly related to his cardiomyopathy and
   less likely to his prior surgery. There is also a question of SVT due
   to a bypass tract (common in Ebstein's anomaly).
   - Continue amiodarone drip. Stop lidocaine per EP recs.
   - EPS when clinically stable
   - Monitor K and magnesium
   3) ARDS. Pulmonary following and assisting in ventilator management.
   Difficult oxygenation is secondary to PNA with V/Q mismatch and not
   related to a residual intracardiac shunt, as demostrated by today's
   TEE.
   4) Sepsis.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics

   Date of service: [**2151-3-8**]
   Initial consultation: CCU
   History of present illness: 39 y/o male with history of Ebstein anomaly
   of the tricuspid valve and ASD s/p TV reconstruction and primary ASD
   closure [**3-/2136**], right and left sided congestive heart failure, known poor
   medical compliance (has missed various f/u appointments at CHB with Dr
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3670**], and at [**Hospital1 1**] with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3671**], who presented to the [**Hospital1 1**] ED
   with palpitations which awoke him from sleep the morning of [**2151-3-7**]. He
   was found to be in VT 230bpm. He began to experience chest pain, given
   amiodarone 150mg IV x 1, followed by amio gtt. He became diaphoretic,
   given etomidate and shocked with 200J, followed by vifib, becoming
   unresponsive and apneic. CPR was initiated, epinephrine x 1, CPR
   continued, shocked at 360J, returning to vtach @ 240. He was intubated,
   returning to sinus rhythm, aspriating vomit; noted to have right
   bronchus intubation and ETT repositioned. Due to hypotension SBP 40's
   started on levophed, neosynephrine, and vasopressin with BP increasing
   to 124/77.  Subsequently developed left pneumothroax with attempted
   chest tube placement failed, had esophageal ballon placed. Early this
   morning had two recurrent runs of a WCT for which he was treated with
   amiodarone 300mg IV then with the second run received 100mg IV
   lidocaine with initiation of lidocaine gtt.
   Currently on vasopressin and norepinephrine with SBP 100s, on broad
   spectrum antibiotics for aspiration PNA (temp 104 F), on iNO
   to optimize V/Q mismatch. Initially found to have pneumothorax post rib
   fractures from chest compressions, resolved on repeat chest CT.
   EP consulted: etiology of VT uncertain, likely secondary to CMP, since
   ASD repair and TV ring would not be expected to give RVOT type VT. Also
   ? junctional tachycardia secondary to medications vs SVT due to bypass
   tract. EP recommended 1) EPS when stable 2) Stop lidocaine 3) Adenosine
   to treat ongoing SVT (unsuccesful).
   BACH team consulted for assistance in management.
   Past medical history: 1)    Ebstein anomaly of the tricuspid valve and
   atrial septal defect
   a)            Attempted device closure of ASD complicated by foreign
   body movement into thoracic circulation which was removed ([**2131-12-7**],
   CHB, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Lock).
   b)            Tricuspid valve reconstruction ([**Location (un) 3672**] technique) with
   a 34 mm tricuspid valve ring, serial number [**Serial Number 3673**], model 4500, and
   primary closure of ASD ([**2136-3-29**], [**Hospital6 3674**]; Dr

   volume of 169.29 cc, LVEF 29.76%, and a right ventricular end diastolic
   volume of 391.15 cc and a right ejection fraction of 36.6%. ? LV
   non-compaction. Mod-severe tricuspid regurgitation.
   d)            Exercise test performed at CHB [**2149-7-2**] (bicycle): able
   to exercise for 8.72 minutes. Peak VO2 12.6 ml/Kg. Peak RER 1.09. Able
   to increase his heart rate appropriately with exercise and there was
   evidence of mild restrictive obstructive lung disease on his baseline
   spirometry. Peak heart rate was 140 bpm.
   2)            Temporal brain abscess diagnosed age 8 after dental
   procedure treated with antibiotics at CHB.
   3)            OSA, does not wear CPAP machine on a regular basis.

   39M w/ pmh of ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction,
   right and left sided systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with
   unstable ventricular tachycardia, s/p resuscitation with return to
   sinus tachycardia, now intubated, with hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of natural history of ebstein
   anomaly.  Currently receiving amiodarone IV, remains in sinus
   tachycardia s/p resuscitation.  Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated, likely
   related to CPR and cardioversion. This AM had sevarel episodes of what
   may have been VT with rate in 120s to 130s, improved with amio bolus
   and increased gtt (however, now also increased LFTs). Required addition
   of lidocaine gtt.
   -likely need VT albation
   -continue amiodarone gtt for now, but careful monitoring of LFTs
   -electrophysiology consult
   .
   #Respiratory Failure: Difficulty oxygenating with Fi02 100% and
   increased PEEP. Per report patient had significant aspiration during
   intubation. PE ruled out with CTA.  CT initially showed left
   pneumothorax, but f/u CT showed resolution after chest tube attempt.
   Also CT and CXRs showing right sided possible aspiration PNA. Being
   ventilated according to ARDS net protocol.  [**Month (only) 11**] have reopened ASD
   repair, causing shunt.
   -echo with bubble study to evaluate for ASD
   -swan cath to check oxygen saturation in four [**Doctor Last Name 135**] to evaluate for
   right to left shunt
   -Giving lasix this AM at increased dose, so far little improvement
   -ARDS net protocol
   -nimbex as paralytic [**Doctor Last Name 23**]
   -nebs
   -if still poor saturation, will consider inhaled nitrous oxide
   -pulm following- appreciate recs
   .
   #Hypotension: Initially secondary to ventricular tachycardia, and
   response to sedatives s/p intubation.  Initially on three pressers but
   now only on levo, still requiring dopa intermittently.  Will try to
   minimize PEEP to maximize venous return. may possibly be from
   decompensated heart failure.  Likely has combination of cardiogenic
   shock and septic shock.
   -pressors as needed
   -fluids as neded
   -would benefit from swan ganz catheter to better understand type of
   hypotenision
   .
   # Sepsis- Leukocytosis/fever/right lobe infiltrate- likely aspiration
   PNA, witnessed emesis during intubation
   -MRSA screen and precautions
   - continue vanco and zosyn, day 2

   # Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Has right and left sided
   heart failure, s/p tricuspid reconstruction and ASD repair. Will hold
   metoprolol, lisinopril, lasix, and digoxin in setting of hypotension.

   hypotensive on pressors, surgery attempted to place chest tube and was
   not able to [**3-15**] heart size and adhesions; IP contact[**Name (NI) **]- also unable;
   instead went to IR to placed chest tube, but new CT no longer showed
   pneumo, serial CXRs without new pneumo
   - head CT- wet read of no acute intracranial process
   - hypoxia- given nebs; vent adjusted for ARDS setting, pulm consulted,
   PEEP increased, esophageal balloon placed; then pressures dropped to
   60s with PEEP of 20 and required 3 pressers; then PEEP changed to 12,
   BP improved, was able to wean neo; [**2142**]-PEEP increased to 16 due to
   lack of difference between peak and plataeu pressures in effort to
   recruit more aveoli;

   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of natural history of ebstein
   anomaly.  Currently receiving amiodarone IV, remains in sinus
   tachycardia s/p resuscitation.  Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated, likely
   related to CPR and cardioversion. This AM had sevarel episodes of what
   may have been VT with rate in 120s to 130s, improved with amio bolus
   and increased gtt (however, now also increased LFTs).

   - CTA showed no PE, but +L pneumothorax with rib fractures; was
   hypotensive on pressors, surgery attempted to place chest tube and was
   not able to [**3-15**] heart size and adhesions; IP contact[**Name (NI) **]- also unable;
   instead went to IR to placed chest tube, but new CT no longer showed
   pneumo, serial CXRs without new pneumo
   - head CT- wet read of no acute intracranial process
   - hypoxia- given nebs; vent adjusted for ARDS setting, pulm consulted,
   PEEP increased, esophageal balloon placed; then pressures dropped to
   60s with PEEP of 20 and required 3 pressers; then PEEP changed to 12,
   BP improved, was able to wean neo; [**2142**]-PEEP increased to 16 due to
   lack of difference between peak and plataeu pressures in effort to
   recruit more aveoli;
   - CT also showed likely right sided aspiration; temp of 102 at 1400,
   cultures sent, pt started on zosyn, given 500ml bolus NS x 2 when
   hypotensive, new leukocytosis of 13.9; at 10pm vanco started (hx of 2

   HPI:
   Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old judge from [**Location (un) 10461**], with a history
   significant for symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation since [**2151**],
   status post pulmonary vein isolation in [**2158-4-25**], presenting for
   elective re-do pulmonary vein isolation for recurrent PAF.
   .
   Briefly, Mr [**Known lastname **] initially noted symptoms upon swimming and
   stressful activity. After failing medical therapy alone he underwent
   PVI at our center in [**2158-4-25**] and was started on amiodarone
   maintenance. Patient however began experiencing breakthrough episodes
   of PAF (documented on holter monitor) lasting approximately 3-4 days
   and which severely limited his abilty to perform actitivies of daily
   life. Patient reports that along with palpitations, he feels shortness
   of breath, lightheadedness, and chest pain.
   .
   Patient was evaluated by his primary cardiologist in [**Month (only) 2287**] and given
   the above symptoms and lack of medical response, amiodarone was stopped
   and plan for re-do PVI with pre procedure MRI was put in place.
   .
   Today, patient underwent successful PVI, however with induced left
   atrial tachycardia patient went into persistant atrial fibrillation
   refractory to cardioversion and ibutilide.  He was given a total of
   460mcg of neo and 10mg IV lasix. He was maintained intubated and
   transferred to the PACU off neo, but SBP trended down to the 70-80's
   and 1mcg/mg/kg in the PACU with SBP 90-100. He was also given a total
   of 1450 IVF.  In the PACU he was cardioverted with 200J to sinus brady
   in the 40's. He was transferred to the ICU intubated and sedated.

   EP STUDY ([**4-/2158**])
   Total of 59 ablation lesions performed (for a total of 5516 seconds)
   using the 3.5 mm Therma-Cool ablation catheter. We used 30W power in
   most regions except the posterior wall, where we limited power to 20W.
   Conclusions
   1. Atrial fibrillation prior to procedure.
   2. Successful pulmonary vein isolation without inducibility of AF after
   isolation.
   3. Sinus rhythm post-procedure.
   .
   CARDIAC MRI ([**4-/2158**])
   Impression:
   1. Normal left ventricular cavity size with normal regional left
   ventricular systolic function. The LVEF was normal at 63%.
   2. Normal right ventricular cavity size and systolic function. The RVEF
   was normal at 55%.
   3. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta
   were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter index was normal.
   4. Biatrial enlargement.
   5. Three right-sided and two-left sided pulmonary veins with normal
   size and orientation. The right-sided pulmonary veins consist of right
   superior and right inferior pulmonary veins with a small accessory
   pulmonary vein originating near the origin of the right inferior
   pulmonary vein. No CMR evidence of anomalous pulmonary venous return or
   pulmonary vein stenosis.
   6. Incidental note is made of a hyperintense lesion as described above
   in the right kidney, likely representing a renal cyst. Renal ultrasound
   is recommended.
   .
   ECHO ([**4-/2158**])
   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
   systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) The right ventricular cavity
   is dilated There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
   which most likely represents a fat pad.
   .
   ECHO [**2160-1-3**]
   The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic
   function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular
   cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. There is
   an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   .
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global and regional biventricular systolic function. The RV is not well
   seen but may be mildly dilated/hypokinetic. No significant valvular
   abnormality seen.
   .
   ECG: ([**2160-1-1**])
   Sinus bradycardia at 43 with PR prolongation and QTc 500. NA, Compared
   to the previous tracing of [**2160-1-1**] there is no major change.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cardiac arrest, evaluate pacemaker wire position.

 FINDINGS:  A temporary pacemaker is projected over the expected location of
 the upper right ventricle.  The tip of the endotracheal tube is at the lower
 margin of the clavicular heads, in satisfactory position.  A nasogastric tube
 is also present, its distal tip not visualized but its side hole is at the
 level of the lower esophagus suggesting high malposition.  The tip of an
 intra-aortic balloon pump is 14 mm from the aortic knob and should be
 retracted by approximately 3 cm.  Hazy pulmonary opacity is consistent with
 acute pulmonary edema.  There are also probably bilateral moderately large
 pleural effusions.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  The distal tip of the pacemaker device projected over the expected
 location of the mid right ventricle.  The nasogastric tube and intra-aortic
 balloon pump are malpositioned as described above.
 2.  Moderately severe acute pulmonary edema and probable bilateral moderately
 large pleural effusions.

 Result communicated by telephone to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4435**] at 1700 hours [**2176-3-13**].

 FINDINGS:  Single view fails to show the uppermost portion of the abdomen and
 the course of the nasogastric tube.  There is a virtually gasless abdomen
 except for some gas within the colon.  Although there is no evidence of
 obstruction, if there is serious clinical concern for dilated, fluid-filled
 loops of bowel, CT would be necessary to definitely exclude an obstruction.

 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 4 cm
 above the carina, with the tip effacing the right tracheal wall.  Nasogastric
 tube extends well into the stomach, then coils upon itself so that the tip
 lies just below the left hemidiaphragm.  Swan-Ganz catheter inserted from
 below extends into the right pulmonary artery.  Another large bore catheter
 from below projects over the atrial region.

 There are extensive perihilar opacities, more prominent on the left.  This
 could represent asymmetric edema, though the possibility of widespread
 aspiration must certainly be considered.

"677",1765,50636,"This is a 71 yr old pt who was transfered from OSH s/p CV arrest.
   Pt reportedly was admitted to an OSH w c/o rt leg weakness/numbness,
   which was diagnosed as spinal stenosis. It was decided to perform a
   laminectomy but at time of premed/sedation w fentanyl/versed, pt
   developed CP/(+)STEMI.
   She went to cath lab( laminectory was not completed) and received 3 BMS
   to mid/distal L Cx. Pt was monitored post op, surgical treatment of
   disc issue was postponed for (+)6 wks. Pt was sent to rehab [**2168-2-15**].
   [**2168-2-15**]- Upon admission to rehab, per family- pt felt "" unwell"". She
   developed chills, felt warm and had nausea, some vomiting.  Pt
   proceeded to ""collapse"" at rehab- although details re:
   rhythym/hemodynamics are unknown. EMS was called and per report, pt
   had  ?PEA/Asystole and received 4 cycles CPR. A perfusing rhythym was
   restored and pt was admitted transiently to [**Hospital **] Hosp ER, then
   medflighted to [**Hospital1 1**]. She arrived to CCU intubated/on Artic Sun- not
   repsonsive but for moving lower extremities, and hemodynamically stable
   at MN [**2168-2-16**] w family accompanying her.
   Cardiac arrest
   Assessment:
   Pt s/p CV arrest admitted to CCU for Therapeutic Hypothermia,
   management of (+)MI.
   Action:
   Pt arrived to CCU nonresponsive, VSS- on no pressors. Started on
   versed/fentanyl gtt for biting ETT w oral care. HR- 60-48 SR/SB and BP-
   110/50-103/40. CCU team inserted Aline left radial after much
   difficulty.
   Adjustments to vent settings per ABG. Minimal secretions, O2 sats/
   WNL/ventilating well. Artic Sun maintained at 34 degrees, pt
   experiencing no significant side effects while hypothermic currently.
   OG tube inserted . CXR revealing good positioning of ETT/OGT. Family
   given information re: CT scan and pt
s current state of progress/plan
   of care. Support/teaching to family.  Close monitoring of neuro signs-
   very gradual and subtle increase in responsiveness over course of
   shift- currently slight grimace/clenching jaw w oral care-suctioning/
   slight movement of arms w Aline/ABG  attempts. Pupils remains NR at 5-6
 not opening eyes to command or spontaneously. No significant change
   this shift overall. Frequent turning, heparin sq, waffle boots provided
   for pt w complete immobility for optimal skin care. Pt arrived to CCU w
   mepiplex to rt gluteal- changed over to new dsg- small clean skin tear
   observed, no drainage.
   Response:
   Pt arrived to CCU s/p arrest, non responsive but hemodynamically
   stable. Adequate ventilation on current vent settings. Family
   appropriately upset over pt
s current condition, but appear to
   understand plan of care and current course of events.
   Plan:
   Await AM labs- adjust vent as needed as well as replete lytes as needed
   per results. SS insulin as needed per BS. Continue to closely monitor
   temps/artic sun/water temp trends and any sign of shivering- add
   paralytic if needed. Continue skin care/ oral care as per protocol.

   Chief Complaint:  transfer from OSH with cardiac arrest
   HPI:
   71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II,
   hypertension, is transfered from outside hospital s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   The patient was in her ususal state of health until 2 weeks prior to
   presentation. At that time she developed right leg weakness and
   numbness. She presented to [**Hospital6 **] where she was evaluated
   at it was determined that she had compression of her spinal cord and
   needed a laminectomy. The patient was set to get the laminectomy and
   was getting sedated with fentanyl and versed when she developed chest
   pain. She had an EKG which showed inferior STEMI and she was taken to
   the catheterization lab instead. At that time she was found to have
   diffuse disease and had 3 BMS placed in her mid and distal left
   circumflex. Her peak CK was 452, MB 27.1 and Trop T 0.93 (per obtained
   labs). These downtrended and the patient was observed. The decision was
   made to withhold from spinal surgery for 6-weeks. On [**2168-2-15**] the
   patient was sent to rehabilitation. Per the family, she arrived at
   rehab and felt unwell. She initially had chills and then became very
   warm. She had episodes of nausea and some episodes of vomiting. She
   then collapsed at which point it is unclear if she was responsive or
   had a rhythm. An ambulance was called and she was taken to [**Hospital1 536**]. En route the patient has ?PEA arrest which progressed to
   ?asystole. The patient received 4 rounds of CPR and epinephrine,
   atropine, calcium gluconate and apparently resumed a perfusing rhythm.
   The patient arrived at [**Hospital3 474**] and was med-flighted to [**Hospital1 1**].

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 8818**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   71F with recent stents to the LCX (<2 weeks ago) for perioperative IMI,
   here after collapsing at a rehab facility without a prodrome.
   Resuscitated within 5 minutes --> [**Hospital3 474**], where given ASA,
   heparin and transferred to [**Hospital1 1**].  Here in the ER minimally
   responsive.  VT seen on ECG.  Cooling protocol initiated and admitted
   to the CCU.
   Overnight, reached goal core temperature.
   Physical Examination
   Afebrile, 130/60 - 60SR - 100% on 40%O2
   Pupils dilated, with minimal response to light
   Minimal response
   Intubated
   regular rhythm, no loud murmur (distant)
   coarse bilateral BSs
   benign abdomen
   Labs notable for initial for Hct 25.6, CK [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10992**].
   Medical Decision Making
   71F with recent LCx stenting, here post cardiac arrest.  Etiology is
   likely thrombosis of the LCx stent.  Neurologic status unclear at this
   time.   Would pursue cooling protocol to best preserve neurologic
   function.  Strongly consider coronary angiography in the near future if
   there is recovery of neurologic function.  In the meantime, would start
   IV heparin, continue aspirin and clopidogrel.
          Cooling x 24h
          Echocardiography
          IV heparin, aspirin, clopidogrel
          Family meeting today
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health
   care proxy. I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). CCU team.
   DNR status discussed. Full code.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cardiac arrest.  Endotracheal tube placement evaluation.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately
 4.1 cm from the carina.  Cardiac silhouette is normal in size with extensive
 mitral annular calcifications.  Aortic knob is calcified.  While there is mild
 prominence of the pulmonary vascular markings with cephalad redistribution,
 this is most likely due to supine positioning and not felt to reflect
 pulmonary edema.  There is likely mild atelectasis in left lung base.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.

 IMPRESSION:  Standard positioning of the endotracheal tube.  Left basilar
 atelectasis.

"681",1765,50636,"This is a 71 yr old pt who was transferred from OSH s/p CV arrest.
   Pt reportedly was admitted to an OSH w c/o rt leg weakness/numbness,
   which was diagnosed as spinal stenosis. It was decided to perform a
   laminectomy but at time of premed/sedation w fentanyl/versed, pt
   developed CP/(+)STEMI. She went to cath [**Last Name (un) 2334**] OSH ( laminectory was not
   completed) and received 3 BMS to mid/distal L Cx. Pt was monitored post
   op, surgical treatment of disc issue was postponed for (+)6 wks. Pt was
   sent to rehab [**2168-2-15**].
   [**2168-2-15**]- Upon admission to rehab, per family- pt felt "" unwell"". She
   developed chills, felt warm and had nausea, some vomiting.  Pt
   proceeded to ""collapse"" at rehab- although details re:
   rhythym/hemodynamics are unknown. Although there is a 12 lead ekg from
   yesterday showing slow VT and cards feels she may have sustained acute
   restenosis if her circumflex. Currently her CPK are trending down,
   peak CPK here 1200. EMS was called and per report, pt had
   ?PEA/Asystole and received 4 cycles CPR.epi, and  perfusing rhythm was
   restored and pt was admitted transiently to [**Hospital **] Hosp ER, then
   medflighted to [**Hospital1 1**]. She arrived to CCU intubated/on Artic Sun- not
   repsonsive but for moving lower extremities, and hemodynamically stable
   at MN [**2168-2-16**] Cooling temp reached at midnight she is to be cool fro
   24 hours then rewarmed overnight.
   Cardiac arrest
   Assessment:
   Pt s/p CV arrest admitted to CCU for Therapeutic Hypothermia,
   management of (+)MI.
   Action:
   Pt reached goal at midnight, however at times today pt became restless
   and shivering.
   She opened her eyes during turning, raised both arms in the air did not
   appear to be purposeful. Was given extra sedation and extremities
   warmed, but pt would have episodes of shivering, requiring high
   sedation to control the shivering. Cisatracurium   4mg bolus followed
   by 0.05 mg/kg /hr.  pt was also overbreathing the vent and blowing off
   Co2
 paralytics improved her ventilation.
   Response:
   .Pt responded to low dose Cisatracurium, she is no longer shivering and
   had maintained
   Goal hypothermia with a range of 33.4-34.0  Her neuro exam improved
   over course of day
open eyes PERL sluggish, + cough and corneals,
   moving nonpurposefully, however now she is paralysed and sedated. Lab
   work foloowed K has come down, lactate down, creatinine now 1 and pt
   urine output increased after fluids changed to saline.
   Neuro wise on Cisatracurium we were getting [**2-4**]  twitches today,
   however now down to 0/4 so Cisatracurium was decreased to 0.03 MG/kg/hr
   Plan:
   Follow labs q 6 hour lytesring of neuro status/ observe for any
   improvements/ seizure activity. Plan for EEG/EKG/CXR this AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II,
   hypertension, is transfered from outside hospital s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest:  Currently hemodynamically stable.  Based on
   history, appears that patient PEA arrested for unclear reasons at Rehab
   facility and recieved 4 rounds of Epinephine.  Strips from her arrest
   are not available.  The patient is stable hemodynamically with MAP > 60
   and not requiring pressors.  The patient has severe 3V CAD that was
   being considered for CABG in the future after pt's spinal stenosis
   surgery.  Unclear what patient's neurologial status is at this point.
   She has some non-purposeful movements of her LEs.
   - Arctic sun protocol
   - EEG in AM
   - TTE in AM
   - f/u final CT head read
   - Consult Neuro in AM
   - Fent/Midaz for sedation
   .
   # coronary artery disease:  s/p STEMI with cardiac cath with
   multivessel CAD s/p BMS x 3 to mid to distal L circumflex.  Patient is
   currently HD stable.
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue plavix
   - Continue statin
   .
   # Pump:  Slightly volume overloaded on exam, likely from volume
   resusitation at OSH.  EF 40-45% on recent Echocardiogram.
   - Monitor, lasix as needed
   - TTE to evaluate today
   .
   # diabetes mellitus type II:
   - HISS
   .
   # hypertension:  BPs in 110s and stable.
   - hold on antihypertensives at this time
   .
   # goals of care: need to have family meeting once neuro status is more
   clear

 HISTORY:  71-year-old female status post arrest.

 No prior studies available for comparison.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the head were obtained without IV
 contrast.

 FINDINGS:  The study is limited due to patient motion. There is no
 intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, shift of normally midline
 structures, or acute major vascular territorial infarction. Periventricular
 white matter low attenuation most likely reflects chronic small vessel
 ischemic disease.  There is also a focal hypodensity within the left external
 capsule, which could reflect a lacunar infarct, of indeterminate age.  The
 [**Doctor Last Name 107**]-white differentiation is slightly ill-defined, though this may be
 technical.  There is moderate opacification of bilateral ethmoid air cells.
 Osseous structures are unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
 2.  Slightly ill-defined [**Doctor Last Name 107**]-white differentiation, which may be technical.
 However, close interval followup is suggested.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Insertion of biventricular pacemaker, decline in cognitive
 function, cardiac arrest with subsequent intubation and frank hemoptysis.
 Supratherapeutic INR.

 FINDINGS:  Comparison made with a radiograph dated [**2145-6-8**] at 01.47 hours
 (pre-cardiac arrest).  There is new asymmetric  opacity in the right lung and
 new bilateral alveolar and interstitial opacities in both lungs on a
 background of moderate cardiomegaly.  No rib fractures or pneumothorax. An
 endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube have been inserted since the previous
 radiograph and are in satisfactory positions.  The positions of the right
 atrial, right ventricular and epicardial pacing wire are satisfactory and
 unchanged.  Moderately severe bilateral glenohumeral subluxation is
 incidentally noted.
 IMPRESSION:  Alveolar and interstitial pulmonary edema, worse on the right.
 The diffuse ground-glass opacity in the right lung may be attributable in part
 to pulmonary hemorrhage, which would fit with the given clinical history.

 HISTORY:  Cardiomyopathy status post ICD.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**10-17**], the tip of the endotracheal
 tube measures approximately 6.5 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube extends
 to the distal stomach and ICD device is in the region of the apex of right
 ventricle.  Substnatial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.  There
 appears to be some increasing fullness of pulmonary vessels as well as
 increased opacification at the bases suggestive of pleural effusions with
 compressive atelectasis.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cardiopulmonary arrest, chest pain secondary to chest
 compressions.

 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.

 FINDINGS:  A single portable upright view of the chest was obtained.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation,
 effusion or pneumothorax.  High-density at the left base may represent a small
 amount of atelectasis.  The heart is top normal size to mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  A well-defined rounded density to the
 right of the trachea without mass effect on the trachea may be soft tissue or
 external to the patient, and follow up is recommended.

 IMPRESSION: Rounded density to right of trachea without mass effect of unclear
 significance. Suggest PA and lateral views versus repeat portable radiograph
 when patient is clinically able to further assess if the finding is
 external/artifact to the patient.  If finding persists, suggest chest CT.

  There is no definite rib fracture, though if concern exists at a particular
  rib or side, dedicated rib radiographs may better elucidate any pathology.
  Round paratracheal opacity discussed previously is no longer apparent.  No
  pneumothorax.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post chest compressions for cardiac arrest with rounded
 density on prior radiograph.  Assess for rib fracture and persistence of
 rounded density.

 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs [**2183-10-22**].

 FINDINGS:  Possible rib fractures are seen in the anterior second and third
 right ribs.  Otherwise, small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
 Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis is seen.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear
 without focal opacity.  The heart size is top normal with normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.
 Previously described rounded opacity represents the manubrium.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Tiny anterior right rib fractures of the second and third ribs.  Recommend
 correlation with exam findings and dedicated rib series if further evaluation
 is needed.
 2.  Minimal left basal atelectasis.

 These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3329**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 853**] at 10:00 on

   She received atropine and epinephrine and CPR started with restoration
   of perfusing rhythm within minutes. ECG per report demonstrated 2mm
   anterior ST elevations and Code STEMI called. Cardiology evaluated and
   felt not consistent with ACS. Bedside TTE by Cards fellow reportedly
   showed no effusion and no focal wall motion abnormality. CXR showed
   complete left lung collapse. CTA negative for PE. Pt started on

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yr old woman with Stage IV lung Ca presents with resp arrest,
   cardiac arrest, and hypotension.
   Possible evolution of events was that hemoptysis evolved, clotted off
   left mainstem leading to resp distress and ultimately arrest from
   hypoxemia.
   Problems
   [**Name (NI) 1531**]
   Respiratory Failure
   Anemia
   1.       Hypoxemic Resp Distress: due to left lung collapse with
   possible post obstructive blood and or pus. Currently on AC 400 x 10,
   PIP 24, and last gas with quite hypercarbia- since she has COPFD and is
   one lung vented ? autoPEEP and created Zone 1 lung. We will try smaller
   volume and slightly faster rate. Place A line for frequent ABGs and
   hemodynamics. If she bleeds needs left lung down, advance ETT into
   right mainstem and alert IP for urgent intervention. Could also try
   endobronchial blocker. We will cover with Vanco Zosyn for possible post
   obstruictuive PNA esp with plans for intervention in AM.
   2.       Cardiac Arrest: seems that she was hypoxemic then bradycardic
   then PEA
 resolved with brief epi/atrop/CPR
 currently on Neo but
   weaning off
 goal MAP 60-65, maintain UOP 30cc/hr. Formal Echo to be
   done. Cycyle CKs.
   3.       Anemia: source of blood loss unclear, not GI source, Abd CT
   neg for RP or abd bleed, may be blood in chest as source of loss though
   not overt hemoptysis now.
   4.       [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]- likely murantic- we have to hold anti coagulation
   acutely but will need to re evaluate once rigid bronch done and risks
   benefits can be assessed.
   5.       Neuro: post arrest- short down time by report. Will check stat
   head CT to look for blled (known mets). Serail Neuro exams throughout
   eveing
   Remaining issues as per Housestaff notes.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SUPINE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH.

 HISTORY:  63-year-old woman with cardiac arrest.  Now status post intubation.
 Evaluate for tube placement and intrathoracic pathology.

 COMPARISON:  CTA chest from [**2144-9-11**].  Portable chest x-ray from [**9-11**], [**2144**].

 FINDINGS:  There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax with few air
 bronchograms noted. There is relative preservation of left lung volume with no
 significant shift of the mediastinum. The right heart border is visualized and
 the trachea appears midline.  The patient is intubated and the endotracheal
 tube appears in satisfactory position at the level of the aortic arch.  The
 right lung is hyperexpanded. There are no fractures identified.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Complete opacification of the left hemithorax, likely due to lung collapse
 though given the relative preservation of lung volume, a component of pleural
 effusion and aspiration may also be present.
 2.  ETT tube in satisfactory position.

 The results of this finding were communicated with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 382**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 660**] at the time
 this study was performed.

   HPI:
   63y.o. F with a PMH of metastatic non small cell Lung CA found this AM
   at home by son with acute resp distress, agoal breathing. Called 911
   and pt was found to be unresponsive. On arrival to the ED the patient
   was intubated. Reports by ED, difficulty passing ET tube. Following
   intubation she was bradycardic and in probable PEA arrest (no strips).
   She received atropine and epinephrine and CPR started with restoration
   of perfusing rhythm within minutes. ECG per report demonstrated 2mm
   anterior ST elevations and Code STEMI called. Cardiology evaluated and
   felt not consistent with ACS. Bedside TTE by Cards fellow reportedly
   showed no effusion and no focal wall motion abnormality. CXR showed
   complete left lung collapse. CTA negative for PE. Pt started on
   phenyephrine for SBP 63. HCT found to be 20 and pt given 1U PRBC.
   Femoral line placed. CT Abd/pelvis completed with prelim read negative
   for bleed. IP consulted in the ED for L lung collapse.

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yr old woman with Stage IV lung Ca presents with resp arrest,
   cardiac arrest, and hypotension.
   Possible evolution of events was that hemoptysis evolved, clotted off
   left mainstem leading to resp distress and ultimately arrest from
   hypoxemia.
   Problems
   [**Name (NI) 1531**]
   Respiratory Failure
   Anemia
   1.       Hypoxemic Resp Distress: due to left lung collapse with
   possible post obstructive blood and or pus. Currently on AC 400 x 10,
   PIP 24, and last gas with quite hypercarbia- since she has COPFD and is
   one lung vented ? autoPEEP and created Zone 1 lung. We will try smaller
   volume and slightly faster rate. Place A line for frequent ABGs and
   hemodynamics. If she bleeds needs left lung down, advance ETT into
   right mainstem and alert IP for urgent intervention. Could also try
   endobronchial blocker. We will cover with Vanco Zosyn for possible post
   obstruictuive PNA esp with plans for intervention in AM.
   2.       Cardiac Arrest: seems that she was hypoxemic then bradycardic
   then PEA
 resolved with brief epi/atrop/CPR
 currently on Neo but
   weaning off
 goal MAP 60-65, maintain UOP 30cc/hr. Formal Echo to be
   done. Cycyle CKs.
   3.       Anemia: source of blood loss unclear, not GI source, Abd CT
   neg for RP or abd bleed, may be blood in chest as source of loss though
   not overt hemoptysis now.
   4.       [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]- likely murantic- we have to hold anti coagulation
   acutely but will need to re evaluate once rigid bronch done and risks
   benefits can be assessed.
   5.       Neuro: post arrest- short down time by report. Will check stat
   head CT to look for blled (known mets). Serail Neuro exams throughout
   eveing
   Remaining issues as per Housestaff notes.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 year Russian speaking male with PMH DM, reported prior CVA s/p
   cardiac arrest (PEA). Resuscitated to wide complex perfusing rhythm. ED
   code STEMI was called for inferior STE and anterolateral ST depressions
   - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA s/p bare metal stent. Patient
   unstable in cath lab required multiple pressors, ballon pump and temp
   wire. Patient continues to be intubated, on pressors, with balloon
   pump; slowly being weaned off vent and pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct
   - ASA 325 mg qd and daily plavix 75 mg qd (patient was plavix loaded
   yesterday)
   - Patient post-cath with epitaxis (no more bleeding since); due to
   coagulopathy affects of cooling hold integrillin due to risk > benefit
   - Pressor support to maintain MAP >50
   .
   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33. EF: 25%.
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean pressors.
   - Continue ballon pump; on heparin gtt
   - Limit fluid intake
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload, goal 2-3L off as
   tolerated
   - Continue with lasix drip; additional diuresis as tolerated with loop
   or thiazide diuretic
   .
   # RHYTHM: Hx of PEA and V Tach s/p temp wire. Was in afib, currently
   appears to be in sinus rhythm.
   - D/C amiodorane drip now, (currently 0.5 mg/min)
   - Initiate Amiodarone po 400mg tid
   - Consider cardioversion if loses sinus rhythm
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest: Most likely secondary to unstable V Tach and RCA RV
   infarct.
   - Artic sun cooling protocol
 now in warming phase
   - For treatment of underlying causes [**Last Name 435**] problem list.
   .
   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation initially. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis. Serum
   tox negative. Patient does not take diabetes medications as outpatient,
   per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 9217**] was 1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   This morning, most recent ABG: 7.25/33/91/-[**12-7**]. Acidemic
 metabolic
   acidosis, respiratory compensation via Winter
s Formula should put the
   pCO2 at between 26 and 30, so see inadequate compensation as some CO2
   still being retained. Serum ketones negative so less concerning picture
   for DKA.
   - Lactic Acidosis: replete bicarb as needed, based upon acid/base
   status as it fluctuates throughout the day
   - Maintain vent settings, increase RR if needed to help with metabolic
   acidosis compensation; ok to have slight lack of full respiratory
   compensation, as part of ARDSnet protocol for ventilation
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patchy infiltrate throughout CXR, most likely
   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated. Patient net
   positive yesterday so concern for worsening pulmonary edema.
   - repeat CXR this AM
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics while ventilated for now, decreasing as tolerated
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation (from 14 to 16 this morning)
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip and extra diuresis as tolerated to increase urine output
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl
   .
   # Neuro: Pt with poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
   Yesterday morning, GCS 3. Neurology unable to assess MS due to sedation
   and cooling. Of note patient too unstable to have head CT scan prior to
   cath and does have prior history of stroke. Neuro feels status
   epilepticus is occurring, based on EEG. Patient treated with keppra and
   midazolam thus far.
   -cooling blanket
   -EEG per cooling protocol
   -f/u neuro recs
   -continue keppra [**Hospital1 **]
 ask neuro about dose due to renal failure
   -continue midazolam
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Insulin resistance picture could be part of
   sympathomimetic treatment plus overall ischemic state. Serum ketones
   negative, so DKA less likely.
   - Insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**] rec
s, replete K > 3.3 (but on hold now
   during warming stage of Arctic sun)
   - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 72**] rec
s today
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Prior baseline 0.9 creatinine. Acute renal
   failure most likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Pt not responsive to
   160 mg bolus of lasix given in cath lab. Responded to lasix drip and
   thiazide diuretic with urine output yesterday and overnight.
   - renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip continue
   - renal dose all meds
   - follow-up lytes q6hr, replete as needed

   ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] today and
   I concur with the history, physical examination, assessment and
   treatment plan.   I was present during the entire portion of the
   physical examination.
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9204**] is a 77 year old man who suffered an inferior wall STEMI
   complicated by cardiogenic shock earlier this AM.  He was treated with
   PCI using a BMS in the distal RCA following thrombectomy with the
   support of a pacemaker and IABP.
   He was cooled for 24 hours for neuro protection and is now warm.  There
   has been no return in her neurologic function.  His IABP was removed
   for leg leg ischemia and he is currently on reduced pressor
   requirements.  This resulted in a doppler left popliteal and faint PT
   pulse. He is urinating > 100 cc clear urine per hour.
   We have continued all aggressive supportive care until his prognosis in
   better defined tomorrow.
   His prognosis for long-term recovery remains uncertain and this has
   been discussed with his wife and family.

   Assessment:
   Pt had been unresponsive to any stimuli and versed was dropped to .5
   and fentanyl to 25mic. By 1100 he was noted to have tongue twitching
   and periodic myoclonic jerks that would cause him to flail and for his
   eyes to open slightly. He became dyscordanant with with vent. His
   pupils were unresponsive and no cranial nerve activity was noted.
   Action:
   At ~1115 he was bolused with 8mg vecuronium and started on drip at
   .05mic/kilo. Not train of 4 was able to be obtained. The jerking
   stopped and he was ventilated without further difficulty. Continuous

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 77 year Russian speaking male with PMH DM,
   reported prior CVA s/p cardiac arrest (PEA). Resuscitated to wide
   complex perfusing rhythm. ED code STEMI was called for inferior STE and
   anterolateral ST depressions - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA
   s/p bare metal stent. Patient unstable in cath lab required multiple
   pressors, ballon pump and temp wire. Patient continues to be intubated,
   on pressors, with balloon pump; being weaned on vent and pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct
   - ASA 325 mg qd and daily plavix 75 mg qd
   - Patient post-cath with epitaxis; due to coagulopathy affects of
   cooling hold integrillin and plavix load due to risk > benefit
   - Pressor support to maintain MAP >50
   .
   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33. EF: 25%.
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean dopamine then epinephrine.
   - Continue ballon pump; on heparin gtt
   - Limit fluid intake
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Continue with lasix drip; additional diuresis as tolerated with loop
   or thiazide diuretic
   .
   # RHYTHM: Hx of PEA and V Tach s/p temp wire. Was in afib, currently
   appears to be in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue amiodorane drip, currently 0.5 mg/min
   - Consider cardioversion if loses sinus rhythm
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest: Most likely secondary to unstable V Tach and RCA RV
   infarct.
   - Artic sun cooling protocol
 now in warming phase
   - For treatment of underlying causes [**Last Name 435**] problem list.
   .
   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation initially. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis. Serum
   tox negative. Patient does not take diabetes medications as outpatient,
   per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 9217**] was 1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   This morning, most recent ABG: 7.25/33/91/-[**12-7**]. Acidemic
 metabolic
   acidosis, respiratory compensation via Winter
s Formula should put the
   pCO2 at between 26 and 30, so see inadequate compensation as some CO2
   still being retained. Serum ketones negative so less concerning picture
   for DKA.
   - Lactic Acidosis: replete bicarb as needed, based upon acid/base
   status as it fluctuates throughout the day
   - Increase vent RR to help with metabolic acidosis compensation
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patchy infiltrate throughout CXR, most likely
   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated. Patient net
   positive yesterday so concern for worsening pulmonary edema.
   - repeat CXR this AM
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics while ventilated for now
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip and extra diuresis as tolerated to increase urine output
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl
   .
   # Neuro: Pt with poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
   Yesterday morning, GCS 3. Neurology unable to assess MS due to sedation
   and cooling. Of note patient too unstable to have head CT scan prior to
   cath and does have prior history of stroke. Neuro feels status
   epilepticus is occurring, based on EEG. Patient treated with keppra and
   midazolam thus far.
   -cooling blanket
   -EEG per cooling protocol
   -f/u neuro recs
   -continue keppra [**Hospital1 **]
   -continue midazolam
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Insulin resistance picture could be part of
   sympathomimetic treatment plus overall ischemic state. Serum ketones
   negative, so DKA less likely.
   - Insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**] rec
s, replete K > 3.3 (but on hold now
   during warming stage of Arctic sun)
   - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 72**] rec
s today
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Prior baseline 0.9 creatinine. Acute renal
   failure most likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Pt not responsive to
   160 mg bolus of lasix given in cath lab. Responded to lasix drip and
   thiazide diuretic with urine output yesterday and overnight.
   - renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip continue
   - renal dose all meds
   - follow-up lytes q6hr, replete as needed
   - f/u urine lytes

 COMPARISON:  [**2194-10-27**], 12:23 a.m.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the aortic balloon pump has
 been newly inserted.  In the image, the pump is inflated.  The tip of the pump
 projects 5 cm below the line formed by the upper margin of the aortic arch.

 Unchanged position of the nasogastric tube and the endotracheal tube.

 Massive motion artifacts that do not allow for analysis of the lung
 parenchyma.  However, a retrocardiac atelectasis is newly appeared.

 performed.  There was normal flow, compression and augmentation seen in all of
 the vessels.  The peroneal veins could not be imaged bilaterally.

 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.  Note that
 this is a limited examination due to bilateral lines in the common femoral
 veins.

   Chief Complaint:  found down (PEA)
   HPI:
   Mr [**Known lastname 9204**] is a 77 yo russian speaking gentleman with PMH significant
   for stroke, no known heart disease, who presented to the ED yesterday
   evening after having been found down in PEA by paramedics.  Per the
   patients wife, the patient complained of chest pain starting around 8
   PM, then at 11 PM she found him down. Per ED attending note fire
   department initiated CPR for 2 minutes. Blood pressure was 80/p. The
   parametics were able to restore a wide complex rhythm with
   approximately 10 rounds of epinephrine and atropine.  [**1-24**] amp D50 was
   given for BS of 26. Patient was intubated and started on dopamine in
   the field.
   On arrival to the ED, BP was 100/60, rhythm was wide complex with pulse
   in the 60s-80s, GCS was 4. 12 lead ECG showed inferior STE and
   anterolateral ST depressions. Patient received ASA rectal. Heparin
   therapy was initiated. He was taken for emergent cath and was found to
   have to have totally occluded LAD in the mig-segment with
   collateralization, 80 and 60% occlustion of D1/D2 branches, small
   circumflex with no disease, and distally occluded RCA with a 70%
   stenosis of the PDA bifurcation and a 90% stenosis of the PL branch
   noted after recanalization. Left and right heart pressures were
   markedly elevated with a PCWP of 33 and a RA of 23. Thrombus was
   removed from the RCA and stent was placed. The procedure was
   complicated by difficult to maintain pressures and ventricular
   tachycardia that was poorly responsive to lidocaine and amiodarone.
   Patient required defibrillation multiple times. For pressor support
   patient received dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. For
   anticoagulation patient received bivalirudin, integrillin, and heparin.
   For heart rate patient received atropine 1mg and 2.5 Metoprolol IV. In
   the cath lab, ballon pump and pacemaker were placed. Wedge pressures
   were recorded at 33. Pt was given 80 mg lasix with no appreciable UOP.

   Pt is sedated and intubated, therefore unable to complete ROS. Family
   is not by bedside.

   Assessment and Plan
 CARDIAC ARREST
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 77 year Russian speaking male with PMH DM,
   reported prior CVA s/p cardiac arrest (PEA). Resuscitated to wide
   complex perfusing rhythm. ED code STEMI was called for inferior STE and
   anterolateral ST depressions - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA
   s/p bare metal stent. Patient unstable in cath lab required multiple
   pressors, ballon pump and temp wire.
   .
   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct
   (see below).

   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33.
   - ECHO this am
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean dopamine then epinephrine.
   - Continue ballon pump. Will need to add Heparin drip if decrease rate
   from 1:1.
   - Limit fluid intake
   - renal to eval for CVVH for fluid overload

 [**Hospital 2**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
  77 year old man with cardiac arrest, on vent/pressors, concern for fluid
  overload.
 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  Fluid overload?
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Fluid overload.  Patient ventilated and on pressors.

 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.

 Intra-aortic balloon pump has been advanced to standard position.  ET tube is
 in standard position.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 stable.  Multifocal lung opacities right greater then left and also in the
 right basilar and right upper lobe have minimally improved.  Left lower lobe
 retrocardiac opacity likely atelectasis is stable from [**2194-10-27**] at 5:00
 a.m. but is new from [**2194-10-27**] at 0 hours and is consistent with large
 atelectasis of the left lower lobe.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or
 increasing pleural effusion.

   had been having CP since 8pm [**10-27**] and found collapsed 11p by wife). EMS
   called and resuscitated pt- by report Epi/Atropine 10 rounds, intubated
   and sent to [**Hospital1 5**] ED on Dopa and IVF w/o.

   10 times, bolused w/ amio and gtt started.  IABP placed. PCWP 33
 rec
   80mg IV lasix w/ no response, then 160mg w/ no response. Pt admitted
   to  CCU post-cath.
   CCU:  [**10-27**] nites- Arctic sun was initiated on arrival.  He arrived on
   dopamine 15mcg/kg/ vasopressin at 2.4 units/hr/ Levo 0.5mcg/kg/ EPI
   1.25mcg/kg/ Amio at 1mg/min/ Versed 5mg/hr/ Fentanyl 200mcg/min. Pt on
   IABP 1:1 for hypotension/severe CV shock and hemodynamic instability.
   10/5 days-He started on Kepra for seizures seen on EEG and Versed gtt
   was increased. Lasix gtt was started for volume overload and pt started
   to respond w good uo. Also- pressors were weaned slightly but pt
   remained unstable w freq runs VT- repletion of lytes appeared to
   diminish frequency of arrythmias and pt converted from initial AF to
   SR. He continued to have metabolic acidosis. He required vecuronium to
   stay in sink with vent.
   [**10-28**]  More stable hemodynamically with pressures weaned further.Warmed
   to 37 by 1000 and now with low grade fever responding to Tylenol. GI:
   No bowel sounds RENAL: He continues on lasix gtt at 10mg/hr. He
   received 500 diuril at 1100. His urine output improves with higher
   maps. Creatinine is bumping and is 38/2.6.
   Acidosis, Metabolic
   Assessment:
   pH had remained 7.25 and below. Lactate has normalized and he has no
   gap. He is no longer hyperglycemic. Attempts to wean PEEP have failed
   and he has high FI02requirement. Gas at 1400 was more acidotic at
   7.22/48/70
   Action:
   RR increased to 26 with resulting gas improved at 7.27/39/78/-8
   Response:
   Repeat gas later to ensure he does not become more acidotic.
   Plan:
   Monitor gases and treat as ordered.
   Anoxic brain damage (Anoxic encephalopathy, Hypoxic ischemic)
   Assessment:
   As pt warmed vecuronium cut off. He remains on midazilam at 8mg/hr.
   Neuro states he continues to have bursts of electriform seizure
   activity, but nothing  else. His prognosis is very grim.  He shows no
   signs of cranial nerve activity and has had no movement off paralytic.
   He continues on keppra.
   Action:
   He will be weaned off midaz tonight. Neuro will monitor to ensure he
   does not go back into status. Keppra dose renally dosed. Neuro
   attending plans for family meeting tomorrow at 1300.
   Response:
   No change in pt neuro status.
   Plan:
   Wife and neice plan to be here for meeting tomorrow at 1300.
   Translator needs to be arranged for . I  Continue monitoring neuro
   status for change. Wean versed per order.
   Hypoglycemia
   Assessment:
   Once pt warmed blood sugar quickly dropped. Drip was shut off at 0930
   at 133 and pt sugar went to 60.
   Action:
   He has had sugars checked Q 30 min and has thus far required 4 amps of
   D50. [**Last Name (un) 72**] consulted and they feel this is a time [**Last Name 9231**] problem as
   he gets rid of all the insulin in his body. The D50 should be given for
   sugars of 80 or below. We could hang D10 but it would be a large fluid
   load.
   Response:
   He will bounce into the 200s after the D50, but in ~1
 hr require
   another amp of D50.
   Plan:
   Continue to monitor blood sugars frequently to prevent hypoglycemia.
   Cardiac arrest
   Assessment:
   Pt is stabilizing hemodynamically and maps have been increasing. In am
   pulses is IABP foot were absent and foot was both cooler and more
   mottled than R. Doppler studies showed no flow to that foot. Heparin
   had been stopped for PTT >100 and it remained off. ACT remained
   elevated at 198 over a period of time. Pt was stable on IABP 1:2. CKs
   decreasing. He has intermittent self limiting runs of either SVT or VT.
   His K+ is now elevated at 4.5.
   Action:
   IABP finally pulled at 1630.  The groin site is dry with no ooze or
   hematoma. Feet are cool and pale, but no longer mottled. In am
   epinephrine was weaned off as was vasopressin. However maps dropped and
   urine output also dropped so it was added back. At present he is on
   vasopressin as 2.4unit/hr, dopamine at 3mic/kilo and levofed at
   .1mic/kilo. His BP in in th 1-teens/60s with maps in the 80s.
   Response:
   All pedal pulses are now dopplerable. Pt remains hemodynamically stable
   off IABP and epi drip.
   Plan:
   Monitor pedal pulses and groin site for change. Check with team about
   restarting heparin.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 year Russian speaking male with PMH DM, reported prior CVA s/p
   cardiac arrest (PEA). Resuscitated to wide complex perfusing rhythm. ED
   code STEMI was called for inferior STE and anterolateral ST depressions
   - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA s/p bare metal stent. Patient
   unstable in cath lab required multiple pressors, ballon pump and temp
   wire. Patient continues to be intubated, on pressors, with balloon
   pump; being weaned on vent and pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct
   - ASA 325 mg qd and daily plavix 75 mg qd
   - Patient post-cath with epitaxis; due to coagulopathy affects of
   cooling hold integrillin and plavix load due to risk > benefit
   - Pressor support to maintain MAP >50
   .
   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33. EF: 25%.
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean dopamine then epinephrine.
   - Wean epinephrine today, then dopamine as tolerated.
   - Continue ballon pump; on heparin gtt
   - Limit fluid intake
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload, goal 2-3L off as
   tolerated
   - Continue with lasix drip; additional diuresis as tolerated with loop
   or thiazide diuretic
   .
   # RHYTHM: Hx of PEA and V Tach s/p temp wire. Was in afib, currently
   appears to be in sinus rhythm.
   - D/C amiodorane drip, currently 0.5 mg/min
   - Initiate Amiodarone po 400mg tid
   - Consider cardioversion if loses sinus rhythm
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest: Most likely secondary to unstable V Tach and RCA RV
   infarct.
   - Artic sun cooling protocol
 now in warming phase
   - For treatment of underlying causes [**Last Name 435**] problem list.
   .
   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation initially. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis. Serum
   tox negative. Patient does not take diabetes medications as outpatient,
   per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 9217**] was 1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   This morning, most recent ABG: 7.25/33/91/-[**12-7**]. Acidemic
 metabolic
   acidosis, respiratory compensation via Winter
s Formula should put the
   pCO2 at between 26 and 30, so see inadequate compensation as some CO2
   still being retained. Serum ketones negative so less concerning picture
   for DKA.
   - Lactic Acidosis: replete bicarb as needed, based upon acid/base
   status as it fluctuates throughout the day
   - Maintain vent settings, increase RR if needed to help with metabolic
   acidosis compensation
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patchy infiltrate throughout CXR, most likely
   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated. Patient net
   positive yesterday so concern for worsening pulmonary edema.
   - repeat CXR this AM
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics while ventilated for now, decreasing as tolerated
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip and extra diuresis as tolerated to increase urine output
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl
   - Increase PEEP to 16 as PO2 on most recent gas 66
   .
   # Neuro: Pt with poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
   Yesterday morning, GCS 3. Neurology unable to assess MS due to sedation
   and cooling. Of note patient too unstable to have head CT scan prior to
   cath and does have prior history of stroke. Neuro feels status
   epilepticus is occurring, based on EEG. Patient treated with keppra and
   midazolam thus far.
   -cooling blanket
   -EEG per cooling protocol
   -f/u neuro recs
   -continue keppra [**Hospital1 **]
   -continue midazolam
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Insulin resistance picture could be part of
   sympathomimetic treatment plus overall ischemic state. Serum ketones
   negative, so DKA less likely.
   - Insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**] rec
s, replete K > 3.3 (but on hold now
   during warming stage of Arctic sun)
   - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 72**] rec
s today
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Prior baseline 0.9 creatinine. Acute renal
   failure most likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Pt not responsive to
   160 mg bolus of lasix given in cath lab. Responded to lasix drip and
   thiazide diuretic with urine output yesterday and overnight.
   - renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip continue
   - renal dose all meds
   - follow-up lytes q6hr, replete as needed
   - f/u urine lytes

   77M Russian speaking with report of prior CVA with witnessed arrest,
   found to be in PEA by EMS, resuscitated with approximately 10 rounds of
   epinephrine and atropine to a wide complex perfusing rhythm. In ED, BP
   100/60s without pressors, pulse 60-80s wide complex. Initial rhythm
   strip and subsequent 12 lead ECG showed inferior STE and anterolateral
   ST depressions.
   Taken emergently to cath lab where RCA found to be acutely occluded.
   Thrombus removed and a Vision stent was placed. An intraaortic balloon
   pump was placed for hemodynamic support. A temporary pacemaker was
   placed for bradycardia. He developed recurrent ventricular tachycardia
   that was poorly responsive to lidocaine and amiodarone; he also
   required increasing doses of dopamine, levophed, epinephrine.
   PE:  SBP 80/50s  P 100-150s

   global hypokinesis and regional inferior akinesis to the apex. No
   masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. RV with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a

   cardiac arrest (PEA). Resuscitated to wide complex perfusing rhythm. ED
   code STEMI was called for inferior STE and anterolateral ST depressions
   - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA s/p bare metal stent. Patient
   unstable in cath lab required multiple pressors, ballon pump and temp
   wire. Patient continues to be intubated, on pressors, with balloon
   pump; slowly being weaned off vent and pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct
   - ASA 325 mg qd and daily plavix 75 mg qd (patient was plavix loaded
   yesterday)
   - Patient post-cath with epitaxis (no more bleeding since); due to
   coagulopathy affects of cooling hold integrillin due to risk > benefit
   - Pressor support to maintain MAP >50
   .
   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33. EF: 25%.
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean pressors.
   - Continue ballon pump; on heparin gtt
   - Limit fluid intake
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload, goal 2-3L off as
   tolerated
   - Continue with lasix drip; additional diuresis as tolerated with loop
   or thiazide diuretic
   .
   # RHYTHM: Hx of PEA and V Tach s/p temp wire. Was in afib, currently
   appears to be in sinus rhythm.
   - D/C amiodorane drip now, (currently 0.5 mg/min)
   - Initiate Amiodarone po 400mg tid
   - Consider cardioversion if loses sinus rhythm
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest: Most likely secondary to unstable V Tach and RCA RV
   infarct.
   - Artic sun cooling protocol
 now in warming phase
   - For treatment of underlying causes [**Last Name 435**] problem list.
   .
   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation initially. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis. Serum
   tox negative. Patient does not take diabetes medications as outpatient,
   per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 9217**] was 1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   This morning, most recent ABG: 7.25/33/91/-[**12-7**]. Acidemic
 metabolic
   acidosis, respiratory compensation via Winter
s Formula should put the
   pCO2 at between 26 and 30, so see inadequate compensation as some CO2
   still being retained. Serum ketones negative so less concerning picture
   for DKA.
   - Lactic Acidosis: replete bicarb as needed, based upon acid/base
   status as it fluctuates throughout the day
   - Maintain vent settings, increase RR if needed to help with metabolic
   acidosis compensation; ok to have slight lack of full respiratory
   compensation, as part of ARDSnet protocol for ventilation
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patchy infiltrate throughout CXR, most likely
   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated. Patient net
   positive yesterday so concern for worsening pulmonary edema.
   - repeat CXR this AM
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics while ventilated for now, decreasing as tolerated
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation (from 14 to 16 this morning)
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip and extra diuresis as tolerated to increase urine output
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl
   .
   # Neuro: Pt with poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
   Yesterday morning, GCS 3. Neurology unable to assess MS due to sedation
   and cooling. Of note patient too unstable to have head CT scan prior to
   cath and does have prior history of stroke. Neuro feels status
   epilepticus is occurring, based on EEG. Patient treated with keppra and
   midazolam thus far.
   -cooling blanket
   -EEG per cooling protocol
   -f/u neuro recs
   -continue keppra [**Hospital1 **]
 ask neuro about dose due to renal failure
   -continue midazolam
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Insulin resistance picture could be part of
   sympathomimetic treatment plus overall ischemic state. Serum ketones
   negative, so DKA less likely.
   - Insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**] rec
s, replete K > 3.3 (but on hold now
   during warming stage of Arctic sun)
   - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 72**] rec
s today
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Prior baseline 0.9 creatinine. Acute renal
   failure most likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Pt not responsive to
   160 mg bolus of lasix given in cath lab. Responded to lasix drip and
   thiazide diuretic with urine output yesterday and overnight.
   - renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip continue
   - renal dose all meds
   - follow-up lytes q6hr, replete as needed

 rec
d 80mg IV lasix w/ no response, then 160mg w/ no response
   (fdifficult foley placement [**2-24**] h/o prostate Ca). To CCU post-cath.
   Upon arrival in CCU Arctic sun was initiated. He arrived on dopamine at
   15mic/kilo, vasopressin at 2.4 units/hr, Norepinephrine at .5mic/kilo,
   Epinephrine at 1.25mic/kilo, amiodarone at 1mg/min, versed at 5mg/hr
   and fentanyl at 200mic/min. He had IABP in place with maps in 50s to
   low 60s. He was intubated and unresponsive. He had minimal urine
   output. He was bleeding from his nose.
   The pt has remained critically ill on multiple pressers. He has been
   weaned to much lower doses of many, but remains acidotic with profound
   metabolic disorder including hypokaelemia for which he is being
   repeatedly repleted, hyperglycemia and hypophosphatemia.
   Seizure, with status epilepticus
   Assessment:
   Pt had been unresponsive to any stimuli and versed was dropped to .5
   and fentanyl to 25mic. By 1100 he was noted to have tongue twitching
   and periodic myoclonic jerks that would cause him to flail and for his
   eyes to open slightly. He became dyscordanant with with vent. His
   pupils were unresponsive and no cranial nerve activity was noted.
   Action:
   At ~1115 he was bolused with 8mg vecuronium and started on drip at
   .05mic/kilo. Not train of 4 was able to be obtained. The jerking
   stopped and he was ventilated without further difficulty. Continuous
   EEG monitoring was initiated and status epilepticus was seen. He was
   boluse with 2000mg keppra IV with minimal improvement in status. He
   then received 8mg bolus of midazalam that improved his EEG tracing. Per
   neuro versed was increased to 3mg/hr.
   Response:
   Neuro states he continues to have improved EEG readings, less seizure
   activity.
   Plan:
   Continue midaz and keppra as ordered. Monitor for signs of seizures.
   Cardiac arrest
   Assessment:
   Pt remains in cardiogenic shock post RCA stent. IABP is in place 1:1
   with good augmentation and improved unloading. He was on max doses of
   all pressers. He was in a-fib, having frequent PVCs, but no runs of VT.
   Cks 3643 with troponin 20. He has Art and venous sheaths in R groin and
   IABP in L groin. Feet are cold, but all pulses now dopplerable. Maps
   have stayed over 60.  He was profoundly hypokaelemic. He was making no
   urine. pH remains in low 7s with periodic bicarb being given.
   Action:
   Pressers have been wean and at present he is on norepi at .1mic/kilo,
   vasopressin at 2.4 units, dopamine at 5mic/kilo, epi at .03 mic/kilo.
   Amiodarone was decreased to .5mg/min. He was bolused with lasix 80mg IV
   at 1100.  Last blood gas on AC 550 X 24, 15 PEEP and 80% was
   7.26/32/73/-11 15. his lactate was 7. He received a total of 140meq KCL
   IV. dHe received 600lmg plavix down NG tube. He has also been mag and
   calcium replaced.
   Response:
   He has remained hemodynamically stable on  lower presser doses. He went
   into NSR at ~1630, but is now having more ectopy, including runs of
   V-tach. Latest K was 3.2 and he is now receiving an addition 60 meq KCL
   IV. He received 150meq biCarb at 1800.

   He initially lost his DP/PT in his left leg, and warming blankets were
   placed peripherally with recovery of his pulse
    overnight he received 4L IVF with  improvement of his lactate from 5.1
   to 2.7 closing of his anion gap to **** with UOP 30-40cc/hr maintaing
   BPs with MAPs in the 80s. Around 6:30pm his maps dropped to the high
   50
s, his UOP trailed off, amnio off, sedation decreased, fluids wide
   open,  dobutamine was started peripherally and a central line was
   placed.
   He was shivering significantly with subsequent warming, initially got
   vecuronium boluses x 2 then started on vecuronium drip.
   His GFS ranged 300s to 400s with humalog given, and was started on an
   insulin drip this am.
   On Telemetry  he was in sinus with PVCs.

   Medical Decision Making.  Mr. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] is a 51 year old man who suffered
   a large AWMI s/p LAD stent to the proximal LAD complicated by
   cardiogenic shock.   He had a episode of hypotension this AM that
   responded to fluids.  He is undergoing cooling therapy for cerebral
   hypoperfusion.  His LVEF is severely depressed due to the AWMI.  We
   will continue supportive care for his AWMI and monitor for recovery of
   his LV function.  He may required Warfarin for his large AWMI.

   24 Hour Events:
   HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: 51 yo man no known medical history was
   noticed to be driving erratically earlier this morning in NH and
   ultimately suffered an unrestrained MVA crashing his car into a tree.
   Did not appear to EMS to be traumatic arrest. Found apneic and
   pulseless in VF, with downtime of minutes before CPR initiated with
   EMS. Shocked 3x, epinephrine x2,atropine x1, lidocaine 2g IV then taken
   to [**Hospital3 **] Center in NH, then to [**University/College 2158**]. On arrival to the
   [**Hospital1 5**] ED he had a GCS of 7, unconscious. Initial CE were CK: 1694
   Trop-T: 4.11 and have EKG changes consistent with STEMI. He was loaded
   with [**Last Name (LF) 12105**],[**First Name3 (LF) **], integrillin, and started on heparin drip.  Within 3
   hours of his arrest he hit the cath lab and was found to have total
   occlusion of the LAD proximally with BMS placed to the ostium of the
   LAD. There was also 30% distal RCA lesion, minimal Lcx disease. He
   underwent LHC with L ventriculograpy and coronary angiography which
   noted proximal TO of LAD. A BMS was placed.
   On leaving the cath lab he was found to be hypertensive and was started
   on nitro gtt, and NGT was placed, and transferred to the CCU.
   On arrival to the CCU he was hemodynamically stable. A repeat EKG at
   that time showed improvement in his ST elevation post
   revascularization. He was weaned off nitro GTT, continued on [**First Name3 (LF) 12105**] and
   heparin GTT.

   An initial gas showed an O2 of 81 and he was placed on PEEP 12, F102
   100% with improvement in his BP to the 90s.
   Iniital labs were WBC: 23.6 , K6.5, lactate 5.1 with anion gap 17,
   dirty UA, Utox positive for opiates/amphetamines.
   .
   EKG at 0SH: 10:38: HR in 120s, LAD,LAFB depressions related to IVCD,
   SVT, sinus with ST elevation I,aVL, q waves ST elevation V2 to V5.
   over the EKGs the QRS seems to widen but that may just be because of
   the ST elevations. Overall ST elevations become more prominent as do
   the q waves. Following reperfusion, ST elevations less prominent, QRS
   narrowed, axis normalized, bbb gone.

   Assessment and Plan
 CARDIAC ARREST
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 51 y/o male with hx of cholecystecomy/psoriasis
   who suffered STEMI in field with VF arrest found to have TO LAD, s/p
   reperfusion with BMS to LAD.
   .
   # STEMI s/p VF arrest.
   - s/p cath with BMS to LAD
   - on [**Year (4 digits) 119**],heparin IV, atorvastatin, integrillin, Plavix (consider
   increasing Plavix to 75 [**Hospital1 **])
   - cooling protocol x24 hours
   - sedation with Fentanyl/versed
   holding metoprolol/ace given borderline Hypotension
   - EEG for 48 hours per protocol (discussed with neuro and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 92**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **])
   - keep pCO2 between 35-40
   -trend CE.
   .
   Pump: s/p TO LAD >3 hours, with infarcted myocardium.
   Poor forward flow as indicated by renal failure: FENA 0.2
   IVF for preload
   check echo s/p warming.
   .
   Rythm: V fib arrested in field.
   Currently in sinus
   continue amniodorone
   continue telemetry
   q4-6 labs with repletions during cooling.
   Judicious repletions during warming as electrolytes tend to go
   extracellular with warming.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: Tox screen negative for ethanol.
   Lactic acid elevated. No known hx DM but hyperglycemic
   -check UA for ketones
   -IVF to close anion gap
   -q 4-6 labs

"735",1806,53804,"Chief Complaint:
   He initially lost his DP/PT in his left leg, and warming blankets were
   placed peripherally with recovery of his pulse
    overnight he received 4L IVF with  improvement of his lactate from 5.1
   to 2.7 closing of his anion gap to **** with UOP 30-40cc/hr maintaing
   BPs with MAPs in the 80s. Around 6:30pm his maps dropped to the high
   50
s, his UOP trailed off, amnio off, sedation decreased, fluids wide
   open,  dobutamine was started peripherally and a central line was
   placed.
   He was shivering significantly with subsequent warming, initially got
   vecuronium boluses x 2 then started on vecuronium drip.
   His GFS ranged 300s to 400s with humalog given, and was started on an
   insulin drip this am.
   On Telemetry  he was in sinus with PVCs.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 51 y/o male with hx of cholecystecomy/psoriasis
   who suffered STEMI in field with VF arrest found to have TO LAD, s/p
   reperfusion with BMS to LAD.
   .
   Hypotension:
   # STEMI s/p VF arrest.
   - s/p cath with BMS to LAD
   - on ASA,heparin IV, atorvastatin, integrillin, Plavix (consider
   increasing Plavix to 75 [**Hospital1 **])
   - cooling protocol x24 hours
   - sedation with Fentanyl/versed
   holding metoprolol/ace given borderline Hypotension
   - EEG for 48 hours per protocol (discussed with neuro and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 92**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **])
   - keep pCO2 between 35-40
   -trend CE.

   On arrival, EMS found patient to be in VF and was shocked into VT.
   Shocked 3 times in total for VT/VF.  Patient was intubated on arrival
   to OSH ED.  Was given epinephrine/lidocaine/atropine and amiodarone
   with subsequent return of perfusing rhythm.  Reportedly was responsive
   in the ED, and then had a second arrest the details of which are
   unclear but was thought to be respiratory in nature. Was admitted to
   the ICU where impression was for cardiogenic shock with oliguric renal
   failure likely [**3-16**] ATN.

   TELEMETRY:  n/a
   .
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**2106-3-24**]  The left atrium is moderately dilated.
   The left atrial volume is severely increased. There is mild symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is severely
   dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
   20-25%). The septum and apex are akinetic, the basal posterior and
   lateral segments have relatively normal function. Other segments are
   severely hypokinetic. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
   likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric,
   posteriorly directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant
   jet, its severity may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect).
   There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   .
   Echo from OSH on [**2106-4-9**]: EF <20%, Moderate MR, no pericardial
   effusion.

   CARDIAC CATH:  [**11/2105**]:
   1- Limited selective coronary angiography of the RCA showed 90% mid RCA
   stenosis at the site of a recanalized occlusion. The AM branch takes
   off right at the tightest point of this lesion.
   2- Limited rsting hemodynamic assessment showed normal systemic
   arterial
   blood pressure.
   3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid RCA with a 2.75x23 mm Promus
   DES, postdilated to 3.0 with excellent result.

   Assessment and Plan
 CARDIAC ARREST
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  55 y/o M ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 15%, now s/p
   VT/VF arrest transfered with cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Shock/Arrest: Initial rhythm appears to be VF with e/o VT throughout
   ACLS treatment.  Could be [**3-16**] to thrombosis of DES in RCA vs. occlusion
   of LAD although both seem unlikely given relatively flat biomarkers
   post-arrest.  Scar mediated VT/VF is a possibility.  Currently, most
   likely in cardiogenic shock s/p arrest with improving hemodynamics on
   arrival.  Nothing by history to suggest another etiology for arrest
   although cannot exclude the possibility.
   - wean dopamine with MAP goal > 60.
   - weaned levophed to off on arrival.
   - If deteriorates clinically would consider cath urgently, otherwise
   plan for cath on Monday if INR allows.
   - Repeat ECG in AM.
   - Consider RHC PRN.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated for airway protection.  High peak
   pressures on the vent, with relatively small tidal volumes.  CXR
   unimpressive, and oxygenating well.
   - Wean as tolerated.
   .
   # CORONARIES: 2 vessel CAD with DES in RCA.  Plan as outlined above.
   - Aspirin
   - Plavix
   - Hold heparin gtt as INR supratherapeutic on coumadin.
   - High dose statin in acute setting until cath and then consider return
   to home dose if no acute plaque rupture detected.
   .
   # PUMP/Valves:  3+MR/2+TR by echo [**2106**].
   - Repeat Echo to evaluate for new wall motion abnormalities and
   progression of valvular disease that might be contributing to shock
   - Diurese as tolerated.
   - Central Venous O2 sat for Fick Cardiac Output
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm.  Monitor on tele.
   - Will need ICD for secondary prevention
   .
   # Neuro Status: With sedation weaned is responsive and follows simple
   commands.  Reportedly CT head negative at OSH.
   - wean sedation
   - follow exam closely
   .
   # Diabetes: Finger sticks have improved to normal range.  Does not
   require insulin at home but poorly controlled on oral agents.
   - hold metformin.
   - humalog insulin sliding scale
   .
   # LV Thrombus:
   - No e/o thrombus on repeat echo's, and ? need to continue coumadin
   long-term
   - Heparin gtt when INR < 2.0
   - hold vitamin K/coumadin and allow INR to reverse on its own.
   - Likely [**3-16**] coumadin at home with superimposed portion from liver
   failure.
   .
   # Liver Injury: Likely shock liver.
   - Trend enzymes
   .
   # Renal Failure: Likely ATN.  Send urinalysis, urine lytes.
   - I/O
   - foley catheter
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely [**3-16**] to arrest.
   - CIS
   .

   - Start tube feeds tomorrow if no plan to extubate.
   .
   ACCESS:
   - RIJ, will need to change tomorrow AM given placed at OSH.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 569**] on [**2106-4-10**] and Dr.
   [**Doctor Last Name 13698**] [**2106-4-11**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Patient with cardiac arrest due to VT/VF in the setting of coronary and
   noncoronary myopathy.  Pressors being weaned to off and respiratory
   support decreasing.  Will need evaluation for ICD +/- EPS.  Waiting on
   cardiac catheterization given elevated INR, creatinine and fact that
   the etiology of arrhythmia is unlikely due to primary ACS event.
   Critical care time 40 minutes to manage inotropic, pressor support,
   cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, acute renal failure, and ventilator.

   HPI:
   55-year-old male with history of two vessel CAD, ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, EF ~15%, mitral regurgitation, and diabetes on oral
   agents who presents from OSH s/p VT/VF cardiac arrest.  By report,
   patient had been having nausea/vomiting and diarrhea for several days
   prior to admission.  In this setting had decreased PO intake.  On night
   of admission was dry heaving for some time.  Heard by his sister to be
   gurgling and she came up stairs to find patient pulseless, with eyes
   rolled back, rigid and foaming at mouth.  Immediately initiated CPR and
   family called EMS.
   .
   On arrival, EMS found patient to be in VF and was shocked into VT.
   Shocked 3 times in total for VT/VF.  Patient was intubated on arrival
   to OSH ED.  Was given epinephrine/lidocaine/atropine and amiodarone
   with subsequent return of perfusing rhythm.  Reportedly was responsive
   in the ED, and then had a second arrest the details of which are
   unclear but was thought to be respiratory in nature. Was admitted to
   the ICU where impression was for cardiogenic shock with oliguric renal
   failure likely [**3-16**] ATN.

   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**2106-3-24**]  The left atrium is moderately dilated.
   The left atrial volume is severely increased. There is mild symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is severely
   dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
   20-25%). The septum and apex are akinetic, the basal posterior and
   lateral segments have relatively normal function. Other segments are
   severely hypokinetic. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
   likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric,
   posteriorly directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant
   jet, its severity may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect).
   There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   .
   Echo from OSH on [**2106-4-9**]: EF <20%, Moderate MR, no pericardial
   effusion.

   CARDIAC CATH:  [**11/2105**]:
   1- Limited selective coronary angiography of the RCA showed 90% mid RCA
   stenosis at the site of a recanalized occlusion. The AM branch takes
   off right at the tightest point of this lesion.
   2- Limited rsting hemodynamic assessment showed normal systemic
   arterial
   blood pressure.
   3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid RCA with a 2.75x23 mm Promus
   DES, postdilated to 3.0 with excellent result.

   Assessment and Plan
 CARDIAC ARREST
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  55 y/o M ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 15%, now s/p
   VT/VF arrest transfered with cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Shock/Arrest: Initial rhythm appears to be VF with e/o VT throughout
   ACLS treatment.  Could be [**3-16**] to thrombosis of DES in RCA vs. occlusion
   of LAD although both seem unlikely given relatively flat biomarkers
   post-arrest.  Scar mediated VT/VF is a possibility.  Currently, most
   likely in cardiogenic shock s/p arrest with improving hemodynamics on
   arrival.  Nothing by history to suggest another etiology for arrest
   although cannot exclude the possibility.
   - wean dopamine with MAP goal > 60.
   - weaned levophed to off on arrival.
   - If deteriorates clinically would consider cath urgently, otherwise
   plan for cath on Monday if INR allows.
   - Repeat ECG in AM.
   - Consider RHC PRN.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated for airway protection.  High peak
   pressures on the vent, with relatively small tidal volumes.  CXR
   unimpressive, and oxygenating well.
   - Wean as tolerated.
   .
   # CORONARIES: 2 vessel CAD with DES in RCA.  Plan as outlined above.
   - Aspirin
   - Plavix
   - Hold heparin gtt as INR supratherapeutic on coumadin.
   - High dose statin in acute setting until cath and then consider return
   to home dose if no acute plaque rupture detected.
   .
   # PUMP/Valves:  3+MR/2+TR by echo [**2106**].
   - Repeat Echo to evaluate for new wall motion abnormalities and
   progression of valvular disease that might be contributing to shock
   - Diurese as tolerated.
   - Central Venous O2 sat for Fick Cardiac Output
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm.  Monitor on tele.
   - Will need ICD for secondary prevention
   .
   # Neuro Status: With sedation weaned is responsive and follows simple
   commands.  Reportedly CT head negative at OSH.
   - wean sedation
   - follow exam closely
   .
   # Diabetes: Finger sticks have improved to normal range.  Does not
   require insulin at home but poorly controlled on oral agents.
   - hold metformin.
   - humalog insulin sliding scale
   .
   # LV Thrombus:
   - No e/o thrombus on repeat echo's, and ? need to continue coumadin
   long-term
   - Heparin gtt when INR < 2.0
   - hold vitamin K/coumadin and allow INR to reverse on its own.
   - Likely [**3-16**] coumadin at home with superimposed portion from liver
   failure.
   .
   # Liver Injury: Likely shock liver.
   - Trend enzymes
   .
   # Renal Failure: Likely ATN.  Send urinalysis, urine lytes.
   - I/O
   - foley catheter

   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered.
   - Stop Plavix given likely surgery
   - Continue integrillin for 18 hours, or until surgery (switching off
   3-4 hours before surgery)
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD
   - Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain
   - Check A1c - pnd
   - Lipid panel (not checked for ~ 10 months) - pnd
   - ASA 325 QD EC
   - Echo when stable given concern for MR in context of MI
   - CSurg has been contact[**Name (NI) **] re CABG
 they follow
 we appreciate their
   input
   - Trend enzymes until peak and trend down
   [**Name (NI) **] Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades du Pointes
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case
   (concern for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7306**] stretch). It appeared responsible for
   hypotension, but hypotension continues despite resolution of AF
   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided for fear, apparently justified of torsades (given frequent
   ectopy). However, desire to avoid beta blocker, based on recent trial
   data with AMI patients, and very frequently falling pressure with
   ventricular tachycardia eventually led to us deciding upon amiodarone
   loading. This has indeed reduced VT and pads are on the patient if
   sustained torsades appears. If his pressure improves today, we may also
   use very small amount of beta-blocker. We will also continue to
   aggressively replete K and Mg and remove the Swan-Ganz line for fear
   that this could also trigger arrhythmias (although, so far, they do not
   appear to have right ventricular origin)
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Leave cardioversion pads in place
   - Start small dose of metoprolol if pressure permits
   - Remove Swan
   - Monitor with telemetry
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will reconsider antihypertensive regimen if indicated and depending on
   indications at discharge. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Continue balloon pump for now
 turn off for short periods [**Hospital1 7**] to
   evaluate pressure without
   - Follow Fick CI with mixed sat
   - Avoid pressors if possible, consider dobutamine as first line
   Leukocytosis
     Likely stress demargination in ACS. Cortisol quite elevated at 26 in
   the evening.
   - Follow
   Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia
   - Replete aggressively to ensure K does not even go below 4 and Mg
   stays above 2

   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered.
   - Stop Plavix given likely surgery
   - Continue integrillin for 18 hours, or until surgery (switching off
   3-4 hours before surgery)
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD
   - Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain
   - Check A1c - pnd
   - Lipid panel (not checked for ~ 10 months) - pnd
   - ASA 325 QD EC
   - Echo when stable given concern for MR in context of MI

   input
   - Trend enzymes until peak and trend down
   [**Name (NI) **] Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades du Pointes
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case
   (concern for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7306**] stretch). It appeared responsible for
   hypotension, but hypotension continues despite resolution of AF
   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided for fear, apparently justified of torsades (given frequent
   ectopy). However, desire to avoid beta blocker, based on recent trial
   data with AMI patients, and very frequently falling pressure with
   ventricular tachycardia eventually led to us deciding upon amiodarone
   loading. This has indeed reduced VT and pads are on the patient if
   sustained torsades appears. If his pressure improves today, we may also
   use very small amount of beta-blocker. We will also continue to
   aggressively replete K and Mg and remove the Swan-Ganz line for fear
   that this could also trigger arrhythmias (although, so far, they do not
   appear to have right ventricular origin)
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Leave cardioversion pads in place
   - Start small dose of metoprolol if pressure permits
   - Remove Swan
   - Monitor with telemetry
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will reconsider antihypertensive regimen if indicated and depending on
   indications at discharge. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Continue balloon pump for now
 turn off for short periods [**Hospital1 7**] to
   evaluate pressure without
   - Follow Fick CI with mixed sat
   - Avoid pressors if possible, consider dobutamine as first line
   Leukocytosis
     Likely stress demargination in ACS. Cortisol quite elevated at 26 in
   the evening.
   - Follow
   Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia

   stays above 2

   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered.
   - Stop Plavix given likely surgery
   - Continue integrillin for 18 hours, or until surgery (switching off
   3-4 hours before surgery)
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD
   - Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain
   - Check A1c - pnd
   - Lipid panel (not checked for ~ 10 months) - pnd
   - ASA 325 QD EC
   - Echo when stable given concern for MR in context of MI
   - CSurg has been contact[**Name (NI) **] re CABG
 they follow
 we appreciate their
   input
   - Trend enzymes until peak and trend down
   [**Name (NI) **] Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades du Pointes
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case
   (concern for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7306**] stretch). It appeared responsible for
   hypotension, but hypotension continues despite resolution of AF
   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided . Sedation and electrical cardioversion successful.
   - Start rate or rhythm control [**Doctor Last Name **], beta-blocker - defer given
   cardiogenic shock
   - No need for anticoagulation with warfarin given short time of AF
   - Monitor with telemetry overnight
   .
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will restart HCTZ on DC. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Follow and monitor with telemetry
   - Pressors (preferably Levophed, dopamine) if required
   - Continue baloon pump overnight
   Leukocytosis
     Likely stress demargination in ACS.
   - Add on diff
   - Follow
   Hypokalemia
   - Repleted with 60 mEq KCl IV

   - No IVFs (received 4.5 L in last couple of hours)

   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness
 most likely hypoxic brain
   injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed

   # Cardiac arrest (PEA or ?bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest:
   hypoglycemia is a possibility, hypoxia less likely. Trop leak and
   worsening ST depressions on EKG; however, ischemia typically associated
   with VF arrest.  EKG now back at baseline
   - ECHO (eval for per effusion and r hear strain)

   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness
 most likely hypoxic brain
   injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed
   - GPC from line (unclear which), elevated lactate, fever: zosyn/vanc
   - EEG suggests encephalopathy rather than seizure activity
   - Will f/u neuro recs RE:utility of anti-epileptics given no seizure
   activity on eeg
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of unresponsiveness.  Question of anoxic brain injury
   - cont mechanical ventilation
   - wean settings as able
   - neuro c/s for EEG to evaluate for anoxic injury
   # Cardiac arrest (PEA or ?bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest:
   hypoglycemia is a possibility, hypoxia less likely. Trop leak and
   worsening ST depressions on EKG; however, ischemia typically associated
   with VF arrest.  EKG now back at baseline
   - ECHO (eval for per effusion and r hear strain)
   - trend CE
   - no heparin or ASA given GI bleed
   # UGIB: NGT draining BRB with hct drop 36--> 27. Unknown baseline. Now
   s/p 4units pRBCs without adequate bump in hct
   - GI consult again today and likely needs EGD for continued UGIB and
   treatment of possible ulcer
   - Goals Hct 30, INR<1.5, Plt >50
   # Hypotension: Improved and currently borderline normotensive off of
   pressors.
   -will need to DC femoral line when stable, source of infection
   # s/p MVR: INR is currently subtherapeutic s/p FFP and vitamin K at OSH
   for acute UGIB.
   -unable to anticoagulate at this time in the setting of bleed

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  81-year-old with recent subdural hemorrhage and cardiac arrest.
 Evaluate for new bleeding.

 No prior examinations.

 NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:  A ventriculoperitoneal shunt enters via the right
 frontal approach and crosses the midline terminating in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 503**] of
 the left lateral ventricle.  The ventricles are barely visible suggesting
 over-shunting.  There is no hydrocephalus.  Hypoattenuation along the catheter
 tract in the right frontal lobe may be due to prior infarct or catheter
 related edema.  The frontal horns of the lateral ventricle are difficult to
 appreciate and likely effaced.  The basal cisterns are preserved.  There is
 extensive atherosclerotic calcification within the vertebral arteries and
 carotid siphons.  No loss of [**Doctor Last Name 107**]-white matter differentiation to suggest an
 acute infarct.  The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.  There is fluid
 within the mastoid air cells bilaterally.  The calvarium is intact and soft
 tissues are normal.

 IMPRESSION:  Ventriculoperitoneal shunt in place terminating in the occipital
 [**Doctor Last Name 503**] of the left lateral ventricle.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage.  Small
 ventricles.

   .
   Assessment and Plan
   .
   A/P:  81F with PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent intraventricular
   hemorrhage found unresponsive at nursing home went into PEA for which
   received atropine and muptiple dose of epi now intubated and
   unresponsive.

   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness - Pt has recent
   intraventricular hemorrhage in the setting of anticoagulation for which
   she had been admitted to [**Hospital1 49**] and now was at a nursing home/rehab.  Pt's
   daughter reports that she is mentally clear, without dementia at
   baseline and was in her usual state of mental wellness one hour prior
   to becomign unresponsive last night.
   - appreciate neuro consult
   - EEG to evaluate brain function
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of unresponsiveness.  Question of anoxic brain injury
   - cont mechanical ventilation
   - wean settings as able
   - neuro c/s for EEG to evaluate for anoxic injury
   .
   # s/p Cardiac arrest: Trop leak and worsening ST depressions on EKG.
   EKG now back at baseline
   - trend CE
   - no heparin or ASA given GI bleed
   .
   # UGIB: NGT draining BRB with hct drop 36--> 27. Unknown baseline. Has
   been ordered 2u RBC in the ED. GI is aware.   Goal HCT 30
   - maintain 2 large bore IV
   - maintain active T+S
   - transfuse to keep hct>30 given active ischemia
   - holding heparin or other anticoagulation
   - consider FFP

   HPI:
   [**Age over 90 **] M with CAD s/p 4V-CABG [**2135**] and CRI had been doing well until this
   AM when he was out walking with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] abruptly syncopized and a
   bystander started CPR quickly.  The local fire department delivered two
   shocks without success.  Then EMS came and gave two more shocks and he
   went back into sinus.  It is unclear whether he regained
   consciousness.  He was intubated but the ET tube went into the
   esophagus.  It was repositioned to the trachea, then brought to [**Hospital1 5**]
   ED.
   .
   In the ED, his intial SBP was reported to be 110.  Labs show K 2.7 and
   Hct 25.  He was given 40mEq of KCL.  On repeat labs, his K normalized
   and his Hct was 33 without any blood.  It is unclear whether one of the
   labs was erroneous.  NG lavage was repeatedly grossly positive.  GI did
   not want to do EGD until his hemodynamics were more stable.  With
   fluids, his BP normalized and the vitals were recorded as: T=34.8, HR
   62, 132/74, 18, 100% on AC 18x500, FiO2 100%.  He was briefly cooled by
   Artic Sun protocol but given his GIB, this was stopped.

   Now the patient is still intubated and hemoadynamically stable and
   transferred to the CCU.  GI is currently doing EGD.

   Assessment and Plan
   39 M with CAD s/p 4v-CABG, CHF, CRI presented with vfib arrest and GIB.
   .
   # Vfib arrest.  Possibly from scar since he has ischemic cardiomyopathy
   by echo.  Not likely from ischemic; known CAD but he did not have chest
   pain and cardiac markers not significantly elevated.  Not likely from
   decompensated CHF since he is not on lasix at home and there is no h/o
   weight gain or CHF symptoms.  Possibly from electolytes (K=2.7 on
   admission).  Not likely from GIB which was probably from intubation
   rather than GIB causing vfib arrest.
   -- should get cath once hct stable

   CABG SVG-PDA in [**2152**], history of constrictive/restrictive pericardial
   disease (treated with stripping in the past?)  who called EMS today
   with complaints of shortness of breath and fatigue.  EMS found him
drinking water
 per ED report, then the patient became unresponsive.
   His initial rhythm was PEA.  He received CPR and then was found to be
   in VT.  He received epi (?) vs atropine (?) and lidocaine and converted
   to sinus tach (all per report). In the ED, his BP was 68/41.  He was
   intubated and EKG was done which showed afib, rate 70s, RBBB, ST
   elevation in aVR and V1 with ST depressions in II, III, V3-V6, poor
   RWP.  Initial labs showed lactate 5, abg 7.19/43/453, cr 1.4, troponin
   0.09, CK 1119, MB 10.  The patient was taken emergently to the cath
   lab.  In the cath lab, his 3 grafts were patent.  He had a stenosis of
   his distal LAD which was treated with balloon angioplasty.
   Cardiac arrest
   Assessment:
   s/p PEA arrest with conversion to VT after CPR in the field [**4-7**] (as
   reported). Also s/p cardiac cath [**4-7**] w/ distal LAD disease treated w/
   angioplasty. On amiodarone gtt. Now cooled via Arctic Sun Protocol to
   goal temperature 34 degrees celcius- initiated at 1830 pm on [**4-7**].
   Unclear neurologic status at this time. Rhythm Afib rate 49-75. BP
   90s-130s, MAPs > 65; good correlation between left femoral aline and
   right radial aline placed overnight.
   Action:
   Difficult to maintain arctic sun temp at goal range of 34 celcius. At
   11 pm titrated goal range to 34.5 celcius on machine as it was
   continuing to cool the patient below the goal range to a low [**Location (un) **] of

   This is an 85 year-old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2143**]
   (SVG-LCx, LIMA-LAD), redo in [**2152**] (SVG>PDA) with AVR, constrictive
   pericarditis, type 1 DM who presents from home after PEA arrest.
   History is obtained from his assistant.  Patient had been in his usual
   state of health this morning according to his daughter and assistant.
   At 1245 he ambulated from the kitchen to the bathroom and complained of
   shortness of breath.  He sat down in the chair to rest, turned red then
   white and was gasping for breath.  He then slumped in the chair and
   became unresponsive.  911 was called and reportedly arrived within [**4-14**]
   minutes.  According to the ED report, patient had initial rhythm of
   PEA.  CPR was initiated and patient was then noted to be in VT.  He was
   given epinephrine, atropine and lidocaine and converted to sinus tach
   with BP 120.  Patient was brought to [**Hospital1 19**].
   .
   On arrival to the ED, BP was 68/41.  He was intubated and started on
   Amiodarone gtt and Levophed.  EKG showed atrial fibrillation with STE
   in aVR, V1 with STD in II, III, V3-V6.  Initial labs notable for
   lactate of 5.1, creatinine 1.4, CK 1119, MB 10 and troponin 0.09.  ABG
   was 7.19/43/453.  He was taken emergently to cath lab and found to have
   patent LIMA and vein grafts.  He had a stenosis of his distal LAD
   treated with balloon angioplasty.
   .
   On arrival to the CCU, the patient is intubated with good oxygenation.
   He arrives on amiodarone gtt, off of all pressors.  HR 80s in atrial
   fibrillation, BP 140-150s/80s.  He is noted to have mild facial
   twitching bilaterally and intermittent jerking movements of arms/legs.
   He is unresponsive off of sedation.  Unclear time frame of regain of
   pulse.
   .
   Of note, the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 1031**] in [**Month (only) 539**] for bradycardia.
   He was admitted to OSH on [**2156-10-9**] s/p fall and noted to have STE in
   aVR.  Troponins elevated to 0.53, CKMB 28.6.  Cath with BMS x2 to left
   main, given amiodarone for atrial ectopy and diuresed for heart
   failure.  He was then admitted to [**Hospital1 1031**] on [**10-20**] with bradycardia
   attributed to amiodarone and improved without other interventions.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 85 year-old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2143**]
   (SVG-LCx, LIMA-LAD), redo in [**2152**] (SVG>PDA) with AVR, constrictive
   pericarditis who presents from home after PEA arrest, taken emergently
   to cath lab and found to have distal LAD lesion treated with POBA.
   Etiology of PEA arrest remains unclear.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Reportedly in PEA arrest initially with conversion to
   VT after CPR.  Intubated in the ED.  He was started on amiodarone gtt
   in [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  Differential for PEA arrest includes cardiac ischemia
   although grafts were patent, distal LAD disease treated with POBA vs
   pulmonary embolism vs heart failure vs primary electrical disease vs
   intracranial hemorrhage (reportedly normal mental status prior to
   arrest) vs tamponade.  There is no evidence for hypovolemia/bleeding,
   hyper/hypokalemia (K on arrival to ED was 4.0), medication overdoses,
   or trauma.  Acidosis was evident on arrival to ED, however may have
   been a result of arrest vs cause of.
   - Continue amiodarone gtt for now to prevent further arrhythmias
   - Induce cooling protocol with Arctic Sun - although patient is
   currently hypothermic on his own.  Goal temperature 34 degrees.  Of
   note, hypothermia can cause hypocoagulability so will need to monitor
   bleeding status - patient oozing from NGT currently.
   - Serial ABGs, goal CO2 35-40.
   - Will check CT PE to rule out PE as cause of arrest and will do CT
   head to rule out acute intracerebral hemorrhage.  Given large contrast
   load will give post-cath and post-CT IVF.
   - Continuous EEG monitoring to assess for status epilepticus once
   patient returns from CT scan - high incidence of status epilepticus in
   post arrest patients.  Can try propofol or benzodiazepines.
   - Neuro evaluation given new symptoms of myoclonic jerking, ? status:
   Concern for anoxic brain injury including anoxic myoclonus, no
   brainstem reflexes and no withdrawal to stimuli.  Neuro does not feel
   movements are related to seizure activity.
   - Check echocardiogram in AM to look for structural heart disease.
   - Pressors as needed to keep MAPs>65
   - Continue to cycle enzymes
   - Check full panel of labs to evaluate electrolytes
   - Continue ASA.  Will continue plavix as reportedly had BMS x 2 in
   9/[**2156**].
   - Trend lactate.  5.1 on admission > 1.6.
   - Tight glycemic control.  Discussed with his outpatient
   endocrinologist who says patient does not do well on lantus.
   .
   #. CAD s/p CABG ([**2143**], redo [**2152**]).  Cardiac catheterization today
   revealed distal LAD disease s/p POBA.
   - Continue to cycle enzymes.
   - Continue ASA, plavix
   - High dose statin
   - Continue beta blocker as tolerated by BP
   .
   #. Pump: Hemodynamics on catheterization not assessed on cath.
   - Echocardiogram in the AM.
   .
   # Rhythm: s/p PEA arrest, converted to VT prior to ED arrival.  Now in
   atrial fibrillation on telemetry.
   - Not on coumadin at outpatient given history of frequent falls.
   - Continue to monitor closely on telemetry.
   .
   #. s/p AVR: Bioprosthetic valve
   - Evaluate aortic function with echocardiogram in the AM.
   .
   # Constrictive pericarditis: Reportedly with h/o stripping.
   - Check echo in the AM.
   # DM, type 2: Discussed with outpatient endocrinologist.
   - Will give 10U NPH [**Hospital1 7**] for now.  FS QID
   .
   # Chronic renal failure: Per outside records appears that baseline
   renal function is 1.5 which is where he is on admission.
   - Continue to monitor closely
   - Renally dose all medications.
   .
   #. FEN:
   - NPO for now.  Will place OG tube while intubated.
   - Nutrition c/s for TF recs
   - Follow electrolytes and replete PRN.
   .
   #. Access:
   - Right femoral line
   - Right femoral Aline - will attempt to change overnight.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  85-year-old male with PEA arrest at home, status post cath with only
 distal LAD disease, unclear cause of arrest.  Evaluate for PE.

 COMPARISON: Prior chest radiographs, most recent one in [**2157-4-7**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT of the chest was obtained before and after the administration
 of intravenous contrast.  The images were reformatted in the axial, coronal,
 sagittal, and oblique planes.

 FINDINGS:
 No filling defect in pulmonary artery branches suggestive of pulmonary
 embolism. Evidence of pulmonary hypertension suggested by increased size of
 pulmonary artery (main measures 35 mm, right measures 26 mm and left measures
 22 mm).

 Presence of moderate amount of right effusion associated with adjacent lung
 atelectasis.  Emphysematous changes with presence of scattered bullae
 bilaterally.  Fibrotic changes are also noted in the lungs, more prominently
 on the left side.  Densely calcified granuloma noted in left upper lobe (3:9).
 Several pleural calcified plaques are noted bilaterally. Calcified plaques are
 also noted in the pericardium.

 ET tube and NG tube are in place.

 Multiple enlarged mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes, the largest one
 measuring 10.6 mm in precarinal station. Heart size is within normal limits.
 Patient is status post CABG, AVR. Presence of calcification of the mitral
 annulus. Calcifications are noted in coronary arteries and along the aorta.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Patient is status post sternotomy.  There are no worrisome bone
 lesions.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Negative examination for pulmonary embolism. Evidence of pulmonary
 hypertension.
 2.  Moderate amount of right-sided effusion associated with adjacent
 atelectasis.
 3.  Pleural and pericardial calcified plaques could suggest prior exposure to
 asbestos.

 INDICATION:  55-year-old male with cardiac arrest status post field
 intubation.  Clear lung sounds bilaterally.  Evaluate for ETT placement and
 cardiopulmonary process.

 COMPARISON:  No prior study available for comparison.

 SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Evaluation is limited due to underlying trauma
 board and other radiopaque objects.  Within this limitation, the patient is
 status post median sternotomy, CABG and aortic valve replacement. The right
 cardiac border appears prominent and may be related to underlying cardiac
 disease.  The right costophrenic angle is excluded, but the right lung is
 otherwise clear without discrete consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion. The left lung demonstrates pleural thickening and possible
 calcification in the apex which could be related to a remote pneumothorax.
 Alternatively these findings may indicate a loculated effusion.  In addition
 there is poor definition of the hilar contours which could be related to post-
 surgical change.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:  Limited evaluation of the chest due to underlying trauma board
 and various radiopaque objects.  Within this limitation no acute intrathoracic
 abnormality.  A repeat PA and lateral chest radiograph is recommended after
 stabilization to establish the patient's baseline.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Non-contrast-enhanced CT of the chest and CTA of the chest, abdomen and
 pelvis.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  53-year-old male with history of chest pain, cardiac
 arrest, elevated INR.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were
 obtained following the administration of 130 cc of Optiray intravenous
 contrast.  No oral contrast was administered.  CT of the chest was also
 obtained prior to contrast administration.

 FINDINGS:

 CHEST:  Large area of opacification involving the right upper lobe,
 predominantly posteriorly, is seen.  Given short-term development since chest
 radiograph performed on the same date at 11:48 a.m. (2 hrs prior), findings
 are concerning for aspiration with possible partial right upper lobe
 collapse(although no significant shift of midline structure), superimposed
 infection is not excluded.  On coronal image 400B, image 33, narrowing of
 right upper lobe bronchus extending to the area of consolidation is seen,
 which could be due to mucus plugging.  Plate-like areas of opacification in
 the anterior right upper to middle lobe (series 5, image 22), may represent
 atelectasis, although infection is not excluded.  Additional areas of nodular

 opacity along the periphery of the right upper, middle, and lower lobes are
 seen.  Additionally, on series 5, image 19, a subtle 4-5 mm ground-glass
 opacity is seen in the left upper lobe.  While findings may relate to
 infectious and/or aspiration, follow-up to resolution is recommended to
 exclude underlying pulmomary lesion.  Atelectasis along the dependent portion
 of the right greater than left lower lobes is also seen.  Overall haziness of
 the lung fields with areas of septal thickening bilaterally suggest fluid
 overload.  No pleural or pericardial effusion is seen.

 Extensive coronary artery calcifications are seen.  AICD lead is seen
 extending into the right ventricle.  There is cardiomegaly.  Evidence of right
 heart failure is seen with reflux into the hepatic veins.  The main pulmonary
 artery is enlarged, measuring up to 3.8 cm in diameter.  The right main
 pulmonary artery is also enlarged, measuring 3.4 cm in diameter.  No evidence
 of pulmonary embolism is seen, although evaluation of the subsegmental
 branches is slightly suboptimal due to patient motion.  No evidence of acute
 aortic dissection is seen.  There are aortic calcifications.  A prominent
 right paratracheal lymph node measures 1.2 cm in short axis (series 5, image
 17).  No hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy is seen.  The esophagus is
 patulous, but thin-walled.  Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating just below
 the level of the clavicles. A left subclavian central venous catheter
 terminates at the cavoatrial junction.

 ABDOMEN:  Evaluation of the viscera is suboptimal due to arterial phase of
 post-contrast image acquisition.  Periportal edema is seen.  The spleen,
 pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable.  The gallbladder is
 relatively collapsed and full of stones.  There is evidence of gallbladder
 wall edema.  Mesenteric haziness is seen throughout, which may be due to fluid
 overload.  Nonspecific bilateral perinephric stranding is seen. There is no
 hydronephrosis. There are severe atherosclerotic changes of the aorta and its
 branches.  The origin of the celiac axis, SMA, and left renal artery are
 patent.  Severe atherosclerotic changes are seen along the proximal SMA where
 there is mural thrombus causing significant narrowing (series 5, image 64) of
 the SMA, flow/contrast is seen distal to this. There are atherosclerotic
 changes along the right renal artery, with suggestion of narrowing at the
 origin.  Atherosclerotic changes of the [**Female First Name (un) 635**] are also noted with the origin not
 optimally assessed, but appearing patent.

 PELVIS:  The appendix is not identified in the right lower quadrant, but there
 are no inflammatory changes in the right lower quadrant to suggest acute
 appendicitis.  Foley catheter is within a partially collapsed bladder.  Air is
 seen in the nondependent portion of the bladder, likely due to
 instrumentation.  There are severe atherosclerotic changes of bilateral iliac
 arteries with extensive mural thrombus, particularly along the right common
 iliac artery with focal areas of near complete occlusion along the distal

 iliac artery (series 5, image 96), with reconstitution seen more distally.
 Very trace pelvic free fluid is seen.  Mesenteric haziness is also noted in
 the pelvis, which may relate to fluid overload.  There is no bowel
 obstruction.  The prostate is mildly prominent.  The seminal vesicles are
 symmetric.  Scattered colonic diverticula are seen.  There is apparent minimal
 thickening of the ascending [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5760**], although this may relate to
 underdistension.

 OSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation is seen.
 Punctate sclerotic focus in the right femoral head and in the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 1829**]
 may represent a bone island in the absence of known malignancy.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large area of posterior right upper lobe opacification, developed in the
 interval since chest radiograph 2 hours previous, findings most likely due to
 aspiration/partial right upper lobe collapse,  particularly given short term
 development.  Superimposed infectious process is not excluded.  Evidence of
 narrowing of a right upper lobe bronchus, which could be due to chronic
 inflammation or mucous plugging, other process not excluded.  Additional areas
 of nodular opacity bilaterally, as above, infectious process not excluded.
 Recommend follow-up to resolution.
 2.  Evidence of fluid overload with diffuse pulmonary haziness, septal
 thickening, gallbladder wall edema, and mesenteric haziness. Cardiomegaly with
 findings concerning for right heart failure.
 3.  Enlarged main and right pulmonary artery suggesting pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.
 4.  Severe atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries, at the aorta and its main
 branches, with focal areas of near complete occlusion in the right common and
 right external iliac arteries (with distal reconstitution) and with
 significant narrowing of the proximal SMA.  No evidence of acute aortic
 dissection.

   [This note is an adaptation and updating of the original CCU admission
   note which was not placed in MetaVision; it reflects history obtained
   by me and by the CCU team. Assessment and plan is for MICU admission.]
   The patient is an 82 year old male with a history of CRI being set up
   for HD, DM, and HTN who presented after a syncopal episode. The patient
   is being transitioned to HD due to continually worsening renal
   function. He is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1788**] of nephrology, with daily
   kayexalate and frequent electrolyte monitoring. By report, the patient
   has not had his usual daily bowel movements for 3 days and had missed a
   scheduled lab check on the day of presentation due to the snow.
   .
   On the morning of presentation, the patient awoke nauseous and not
   feeling well, got up to go to the bathroom and felt dizzy. He was
   witnessed by his family to syncopize, and was unresponsive for a few
   minutes. Following the event, he continued to feel light headed and
   nauseous. The patient complained of low back pain throughout the day.
   It was unclear if this was due to trauma. EMS was called, evidently
   after a pre-syncopal event (per second-hand account of patient
   grandson) on the evening of presentation; he had not clearly worsened
   during the day before that according to his grandson. When EMS arrived
   the patient continued to vomit, his HR was 80, BP 90/50, and he was
   taken to [**Hospital3 **].
   .
   At [**Hospital3 **], the patient was found to be in a junctional
   bradycardia as low as 15; he had a BP 105/70, Cr of 3.5, and K was 6.5.
   He got 0.5 of atropine, then 1mg of atropine without effect.
   Transcutaneous pacer pads were used, but due to concern of low blood
   pressure, no sedation was given, and shocks were discontinued when they
   did not capture. The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] CCU for
   transvenous pacing.
   .
   On transport, Mr [**Known lastname 4518**]
s HR remained 18-20 with SBP of 105-147, with an
   oxygen saturation of 92% on a NRB. On arrival to the floor, the patient
   was found to be minimally responsive with labored breathing. An ABG was
   obtained, with a gas of 7.02/43/102, potassium of 7.3, and lactate of
   7.0. Ten (10) units of insulin and 50ml of dextrose were administered.
   The patient's breathing became increasingly agonal, and bag ventilation
   was intiated. His pulse became thready and systolic blood pressures
   dropped into the 60s. Dopamine was started, and quickly up titrated to
   20. The patient was by this time in PEA arrest and a code blue was
   called. The patient was ultimately intubated. With absent pulse, chest
   compressions were intiated. The patient received a total of 3 amps of
   atropine, 2 pushes of epi, 2g of calcium, and 2 amps of bicarb. The
   patient regained a normal HR at 80 and BP of 120/50.
   Renal was emergently consulted. A temporary HD line was placed and CVVH
   was initiated. He was difficult to ventilate initially until it was
   recognized that he had a right mainstem bronchus intubation; his ETT
   was pulled back and his oxygenation improved. Since then, by report he
   has remained stable on the ventilator. He had a CT scan of his abdomen
   for which a preliminary read suggested colitis and pancreatitis without
   contrast extravasation into the peritoneum. When he was transferred to
   the MICU he remained on dopamine as a pressor but the nursing staff
   were soon able to stop this, after which his pressures remain stable
   and MAPS remained >65.

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Patient is an 82 year old Vietnamese man w/ hx of DM, HTN, stage 4 CKD
   who presented after syncopal event with junctional bradycardia and
   hyperkalemia.
   # Hypotension: Mr [**Known lastname 4518**] was hypotensive in the CCU, even after his
   hyperkalemia and bradycardia were corrected. He had a high lactate. His
   CT scan included findings of possible pancreatitis (supported by high
   pancreatic enzymes) and colitis (which might be source of high but now
   lower lactate).  His lactate is declining which is reassuring; however,
   his pancreatic enzymes are rising and fluid balance will need to be
   watched closely. Sepsis may have been an underlying issue; cultures are
   pending.
   -- q6h Hct and chem.7 as measures of hydration status in context of
   pancreatitis
   -- BP stable for now
   -- discuss fluid balance and dialysis vs fluid boluses + diuresis with
   renal fellow as necessary; currently putting out urine and holding
   normal blood pressure
   -- vanc/zosyn as empiric treatment for first 48 hours in setting of
   high lactate; cultures pending; hope to narrow coverage or remove it if
   lactate appears to be result of poor perfusion only; renal failure
poor perfusion without infection remains the most economical
   explanation
   # Bradycardia: Mr [**Known lastname 4518**] was transferred to the [**Hospital1 19**] CCU from [**Hospital1 **] originally because of bradycardia refractory to transcutaneous
   pacing attempts. The bradycardia was in the setting of severe
   hyperkalemia, and although he first had a PEA cardiac arrest requiring
   resuscitation, his arrythmias resolved after correction of potassium in
   the [**Hospital1 19**] CCU. Agree with CCU assessment that potassium level is likely
   source of his original bradycardia and likely his syncopal and
   pre-syncopal events described by his family.
   -- correct potassium, follow K q 6 for first 24 hours, q12 thereafter
   if stable
   -- no need for pacing currently, keeping on telemetry and pacer pads
   are available if necessary
   # Hyperkalemia: Patient had failed to get labs checked and kayexelate
   was not producing usual BM. Presented with K of 7.3, and likely
   etiology of patients arrythmia, which had corrected with short term
   interventions. Patient
s symptoms of dizziness, nausea, and vomiting
   likely secondary to uremia/hyperkalemia given timing, though underlying
   infection is a possibility. HD line was placed in CCU and dialysis was
   conducted. Currently a clot in line, RNs are working to resolve; will
   check regular lytes.
   - Patient got CVVH today and this evening
   - hold home kayexalate unless CVVH not avail
   - renal following
   # CKD: Secondary to DM/HTN and being transitioned to HD with ESRD.
   Likely contributing to hyperkalemia [**1-13**] ineffective kayexalate.
   - cont CVVH
   - renal following
   - holding renagel
   # Back Pain: Given elevated lactate and reported complaints of [**9-20**]
   back pain in CCU or prior, concerning for bowel ischemia, pancreatitis,
   or aortic dissection. Patient with adequate DP pulses. CT scan done
   today suggests colitis and pancreatitis. Lactate suggests resolving
   tissue perfusion defect c/w bowel ischemia. Follow lactate closely.
   Likely will need f/u CT scan unless clinical improvement becomes
   obvious; if remaining intubated this may be difficult.
   - follow serial lactate
   - follow cultures
   - follow pancreatic enzymes
   # Respiratory Distress: Patient with agonal breathing on presentation,
   poor oxygenation with large A-a gradient. ?Cerebral component from PEA
   arrest.
   - attempt to wean sedation, move to PS to assess pt
s independent
   respiratory drive
   - continue mechanical ventilation
   - CXR in am
   # DM: Patient on glyburide as an outpatient. Patient had glucose of 606
   in CCU with consistent hyperglycemia; may be secondary to pancreatic
   injury.
   - insulin gtt for this acute period, follow total insulin requirements

   [This note is an adaptation and updating of the original CCU admission
   note which was not placed in MetaVision; it reflects history obtained
   by me and by the CCU team. Assessment and plan is for MICU admission.]
   The patient is an 82 year old male with a history of CRI being set up
   for HD, DM, and HTN who presented after a syncopal episode. The patient
   is being transitioned to HD due to continually worsening renal
   function. He is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1788**] of nephrology, with daily
   kayexalate and frequent electrolyte monitoring. By report, the patient
   has not had his usual daily bowel movements for 3 days and had missed a
   scheduled lab check on the day of presentation due to the snow.
   .
   On the morning of presentation, the patient awoke nauseous and not
   feeling well, got up to go to the bathroom and felt dizzy. He was
   witnessed by his family to syncopize, and was unresponsive for a few
   minutes. Following the event, he continued to feel light headed and
   nauseous. The patient complained of low back pain throughout the day.
   It was unclear if this was due to trauma. EMS was called, evidently
   after a pre-syncopal event (per second-hand account of patient
   grandson) on the evening of presentation; he had not clearly worsened
   during the day before that according to his grandson. When EMS arrived
   the patient continued to vomit, his HR was 80, BP 90/50, and he was
   taken to [**Hospital3 **].
   .
   At [**Hospital3 **], the patient was found to be in a junctional
   bradycardia as low as 15; he had a BP 105/70, Cr of 3.5, and K was 6.5.
   He got 0.5 of atropine, then 1mg of atropine without effect.
   Transcutaneous pacer pads were used, but due to concern of low blood
   pressure, no sedation was given, and shocks were discontinued when they
   did not capture. The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] CCU for
   transvenous pacing.
   .
   On transport, Mr [**Known lastname 4518**]
s HR remained 18-20 with SBP of 105-147, with an
   oxygen saturation of 92% on a NRB. On arrival to the floor, the patient
   was found to be minimally responsive with labored breathing. An ABG was
   obtained, with a gas of 7.02/43/102, potassium of 7.3, and lactate of
   7.0. Ten (10) units of insulin and 50ml of dextrose were administered.
   The patient's breathing became increasingly agonal, and bag ventilation
   was intiated. His pulse became thready and systolic blood pressures
   dropped into the 60s. Dopamine was started, and quickly up titrated to
   20. The patient was by this time in PEA arrest and a code blue was
   called. The patient was ultimately intubated. With absent pulse, chest
   compressions were intiated. The patient received a total of 3 amps of
   atropine, 2 pushes of epi, 2g of calcium, and 2 amps of bicarb. The
   patient regained a normal HR at 80 and BP of 120/50.
   Renal was emergently consulted. A temporary HD line was placed and CVVH
   was initiated. He was difficult to ventilate initially until it was
   recognized that he had a mainstem bronchus intubation; his ETT was
   pulled back and his oxygenation improved. Since then he has remained
   stable on the ventilator. When he was transferred to the MICU he
   remained on dopamine as a pressor but the nursing staff were soon able
   to stop this without having MAPs <65.

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Patient is an 82 year old Vietnamese man w/ hx of DM, HTN, stage 4 CKD
   who presented after syncopal event with junctional bradycardia and
   hyperkalemia.
   # Bradycardia: Mr [**Known lastname 4518**] was transferred to the [**Hospital1 19**] CCU from [**Hospital1 **] originally because of bradycardia refractory to transcutaneous
   pacing attempts. The bradycardia was in the setting of severe
   hyperkalemia, and although he first had a PEA cardiac arrest requiring
   resuscitation, his arrythmias resolved after correction of potassium in
   the [**Hospital1 19**] CCU. Agree with CCU assessment that potassium level is likely
   source of his original bradycardia and likely his syncopal and
   pre-syncopal events described by his family.
   -- correct potassium, follow K q 6 for first 24 hours, q12 thereafter
   if stable
   -- no need for pacing currently, keeping on telemetry and pacer pads
   are available if necessary
   .
   # Hypotension: Mr [**Known lastname 4518**] was hypotensive in the CCU, even after his
   hyperkalemia and bradycardia were corrected. He had a high lactate. His
   CT scan included findings of possible pancreatitis (supported by high
   pancreatic enzymes) and colitis (which might be source of high but now
   lower lactate).  His lactate is declining which is reassuring; however,
   his pancreatic enzymes are rising and fluid balance will need to be
   watched closely. Sepsis may have been an underlying issue; cultures are
   pending.
   -- q6h Hct and chem.7 as measures of hydration status in context of
   likely pancreatitis
   -- BP stable for now
   -- discuss fluid balance and dialysis vs fluid boluses + diuresis with
   renal fellow as necessary; currently putting out urine and holding
   normal blood pressure
   -- vanc/zosyn as empiric treatment for first 48 hours in setting of
   high lactate; cultures pending; hope to narrow coverage or remove it if
   lactate appears to be result of poor perfusion only; renal failure
poor perfusion without infection remains the most economical
   explanation
   # Hyperkalemia: Patient had failed to get labs checked and kayexelate
   was not producing usual BM. Presented with K of 7.3, and likely
   etiology of patients arrythmia, which had corrected with short term
   interventions. Patient
s symptoms of dizziness, nausea, and vomiting
   likely secondary to uremia/hyperkalemia given timing, though underlying
   infection is a possibility. HD line was placed in CCU and dialysis was
   conducted. Currently a clot in line, RNs are working to resolve; will
   check regular lytes.
   - Patient got CVVH today and this evening
   - hold home keyexalate unless CVVH not avail
   - renal following
   .
   # CKD: Secondary to DM/HTN and being transitioned to HD with ESRD.
   Likely contributing to hyperkalemia [**1-13**] ineffective kayexalate.
   - cont CVVH
   - renal following
   - holding renagel
   .
   # Back Pain: Given elevated lactate and complaints of [**9-20**] back pain,
   concerning for bowel ischemia, pancreatitis, or aortic dissection.
   Patient with adequate DP pulses. CT scan done today suggests colitis
   and pancreatitis. Lactate suggests resolving tissue perfusion defect
   c/w bowel ischemia. Follow lactate closely. Likely will need f/u CT
   scan unless clinical improvement becomes obvious; if remaining
   intubated this may be difficult.
   - follow serial lactate
   - follow cultures
   - follow pancreatic enzymes
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Patient with agonal breathing on presentation,
   poor oxygenation with large A-a gradient. ?Cerebral component from PEA
   arrest.
   - attempt to wean sedation, move to PS to assess pt
s independent
   respiratory drive
   - continue mechanical ventilation
   - CXR in am
   .
   # DM: Patient on glyburide as an outpatient. Patient had glucose of 606
   in CCU with consistent hyperglycemia; may be secondary to pancreatic
   injury.
   - insulin gtt for this acute period, follow total insulin requirements

"800",1857,57774,"Chief Complaint:  syncope
   HPI:
   The patient is an 82 year old male with a history of CRI being set up
   for HD, DM, and HTN who presented after a syncopal episode. The patient
   is being transitioned to HD due to continually worsening renal
   function. He is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1788**] of nephrology, with daily
   kaexalate and frequent electrolyte monitoring. The patinet has not had
   his usual daily BM for 3 days and had missed a scheduled lab check on
   the day of presenation due to the snow.
   .
   On the morning of presentation, the patient awoke naseous and not
   feeling well, got up to go to the bathroom and felt dizzy. He was
   witnessed by his family to syncopaize, and was unresponsive for a few
   minutes. Following the event, he continued to feel light headed and
   nauseous. The patient complained of low back pain throughout the day.
   It was unclear if this was due to trauma. EMS was activiated on the
   evening of presentation, but it is unclear what had precipitated the
   call and if the patient condition had changed over hte course of the
   day. When EMS arrived continued to vomit, his HR was 80, BP 90/50, and
   was taken to [**Hospital3 **].
   .
   At [**Hospital3 **], the patient was found to be in a junctional
   bradycardia as low as 15, BP 105/70, Cr of 3.5, and K was 6.5. He got
   0.5 of atropine, then 1mg of atropine without effect. Transcutaneous
   pacer pads were paced, but due to concern of low blood presure, no
   sedation was given, and pain shocks were discontinued when they not
   capture. The patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 19**] CCU for transvenous
   pacing.
   .
   On transport, pts HR remained 18-20 with SBP of 105-147, satting 92% on
   a NRB. On arrival to the floor, the patient was found to be minimally
   responsive with labored breathing. An ABG was obtained, with a gas of
   7.02/43/102, a potassium of 7.3, and a lactate of 7.0. 10 Units of
   insulin and 50ml of dextrose were administered. The patient's breathing
   became increasingly agonal, and bag ventilation was intiated. His pulse
   became thready and blood pressures dropped into 60s systolic. Dopamine
   was intiated, and quickly up titrated to 20. A code blue was called
   with the patient in PEA arrest. The patient was ultimatly intubated.
   With absent pulse, chest compressions were intiated. The patient
   received a total of 3 amps of atropine, 2 pushes of epi, 2g of calcium,
   and 2 amps of bicarb. The patient regained a normal HR at 80 and BP of
   120/50.
   Renal was emergently consulted. An temporarly HD line was placed and
   CVVH was initiated. He was difficult to ventilate initially until it
   was recognized that he had a mainstem bronchus intubation; his ETT was
   pulled back and his oxygenation improved.

   -- correct potassium as described below
   -- hold off on pacing until potassium is correct and see if junctional
   rhythm pursists
   .
   # Hypotension: At first attributed low BP to poor cardiac output from
   hyperkalemia dysthrythmia. However, even after correcting, and improved
   cardiac function, patient remains hypotensive with pressor requirment.
   Given lactic acid levels, concerns that underlying infecious or

   HPI:
   [This note is an adaptation and updating of the original CCU admission
   note which was not placed in MetaVision; it reflects history obtained
   by me and by the CCU team. Assessment and plan is for MICU admission.]
   The patient is an 82 year old male with a history of CRI being set up
   for HD, DM, and HTN who presented after a syncopal episode. The patient
   is being transitioned to HD due to continually worsening renal
   function. He is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1788**] of nephrology, with daily
   kayexalate and frequent electrolyte monitoring. By report, the patient
   has not had his usual daily bowel movements for 3 days and had missed a
   scheduled lab check on the day of presentation due to the snow.
   .
   On the morning of presentation, the patient awoke nauseous and not
   feeling well, got up to go to the bathroom and felt dizzy. He was
   witnessed by his family to syncopize, and was unresponsive for a few
   minutes. Following the event, he continued to feel light headed and
   nauseous. The patient complained of low back pain throughout the day.
   It was unclear if this was due to trauma. EMS was called, evidently
   after a pre-syncopal event (per second-hand account of patient
   grandson) on the evening of presentation; he had not clearly worsened
   during the day before that according to his grandson. When EMS arrived
   the patient continued to vomit, his HR was 80, BP 90/50, and he was
   taken to [**Hospital3 **].
   .
   At [**Hospital3 **], the patient was found to be in a junctional
   bradycardia as low as 15; he had a BP 105/70, Cr of 3.5, and K was 6.5.
   He got 0.5 of atropine, then 1mg of atropine without effect.
   Transcutaneous pacer pads were used, but due to concern of low blood
   pressure, no sedation was given, and shocks were discontinued when they
   did not capture. The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] CCU for
   transvenous pacing.
   .
   On transport, Mr [**Known lastname 4518**]
s HR remained 18-20 with SBP of 105-147, with an
   oxygen saturation of 92% on a NRB. On arrival to the floor, the patient
   was found to be minimally responsive with labored breathing. An ABG was
   obtained, with a gas of 7.02/43/102, potassium of 7.3, and lactate of
   7.0. Ten (10) units of insulin and 50ml of dextrose were administered.
   The patient's breathing became increasingly agonal, and bag ventilation
   was intiated. His pulse became thready and systolic blood pressures
   dropped into the 60s. Dopamine was started, and quickly up titrated to
   20. The patient was by this time in PEA arrest and a code blue was
   called. The patient was ultimately intubated. With absent pulse, chest
   compressions were intiated. The patient received a total of 3 amps of
   atropine, 2 pushes of epi, 2g of calcium, and 2 amps of bicarb. The
   patient regained a normal HR at 80 and BP of 120/50.
   Renal was emergently consulted. A temporary HD line was placed and CVVH
   was initiated. He was difficult to ventilate initially until it was
   recognized that he had a right mainstem bronchus intubation; his ETT
   was pulled back and his oxygenation improved. Since then, by report he
   has remained stable on the ventilator. He had a CT scan of his abdomen
   for which a preliminary read suggested colitis and pancreatitis without
   contrast extravasation into the peritoneum. When he was transferred to
   the MICU he remained on dopamine as a pressor but the nursing staff
   were soon able to stop this, after which his pressures remain stable
   and MAPS remained >65.

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Patient is an 82 year old Vietnamese man w/ hx of DM, HTN, stage 4 CKD
   who presented after syncopal event with junctional bradycardia and
   hyperkalemia.
   # Bradycardia: Mr [**Known lastname 4518**] was transferred to the [**Hospital1 19**] CCU from [**Hospital1 **] originally because of bradycardia refractory to transcutaneous
   pacing attempts. The bradycardia was in the setting of severe
   hyperkalemia, and although he first had a PEA cardiac arrest requiring
   resuscitation, his arrythmias resolved after correction of potassium in
   the [**Hospital1 19**] CCU. Agree with CCU assessment that potassium level is likely
   source of his original bradycardia and likely his syncopal and
   pre-syncopal events described by his family.
   -- correct potassium, follow K q 6 for first 24 hours, q12 thereafter
   if stable
   -- no need for pacing currently, keeping on telemetry and pacer pads
   are available if necessary
   .
   # Hypotension: Mr [**Known lastname 4518**] was hypotensive in the CCU, even after his
   hyperkalemia and bradycardia were corrected. He had a high lactate. His
   CT scan included findings of possible pancreatitis (supported by high
   pancreatic enzymes) and colitis (which might be source of high but now
   lower lactate).  His lactate is declining which is reassuring; however,
   his pancreatic enzymes are rising and fluid balance will need to be
   watched closely. Sepsis may have been an underlying issue; cultures are
   pending.
   -- q6h Hct and chem.7 as measures of hydration status in context of
   likely pancreatitis
   -- BP stable for now
   -- discuss fluid balance and dialysis vs fluid boluses + diuresis with
   renal fellow as necessary; currently putting out urine and holding
   normal blood pressure
   -- vanc/zosyn as empiric treatment for first 48 hours in setting of
   high lactate; cultures pending; hope to narrow coverage or remove it if
   lactate appears to be result of poor perfusion only; renal failure
poor perfusion without infection remains the most economical
   explanation
   # Hyperkalemia: Patient had failed to get labs checked and kayexelate
   was not producing usual BM. Presented with K of 7.3, and likely
   etiology of patients arrythmia, which had corrected with short term
   interventions. Patient
s symptoms of dizziness, nausea, and vomiting
   likely secondary to uremia/hyperkalemia given timing, though underlying
   infection is a possibility. HD line was placed in CCU and dialysis was
   conducted. Currently a clot in line, RNs are working to resolve; will
   check regular lytes.
   - Patient got CVVH today and this evening
   - hold home keyexalate unless CVVH not avail
   - renal following
   .
   # CKD: Secondary to DM/HTN and being transitioned to HD with ESRD.
   Likely contributing to hyperkalemia [**1-13**] ineffective kayexalate.
   - cont CVVH
   - renal following
   - holding renagel
   .
   # Back Pain: Given elevated lactate and complaints of [**9-20**] back pain,
   concerning for bowel ischemia, pancreatitis, or aortic dissection.
   Patient with adequate DP pulses. CT scan done today suggests colitis
   and pancreatitis. Lactate suggests resolving tissue perfusion defect
   c/w bowel ischemia. Follow lactate closely. Likely will need f/u CT
   scan unless clinical improvement becomes obvious; if remaining
   intubated this may be difficult.
   - follow serial lactate
   - follow cultures
   - follow pancreatic enzymes
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Patient with agonal breathing on presentation,
   poor oxygenation with large A-a gradient. ?Cerebral component from PEA
   arrest.
   - attempt to wean sedation, move to PS to assess pt
s independent
   respiratory drive
   - continue mechanical ventilation
   - CXR in am
   .
   # DM: Patient on glyburide as an outpatient. Patient had glucose of 606
   in CCU with consistent hyperglycemia; may be secondary to pancreatic
   injury.
   - insulin gtt for this acute period, follow total insulin requirements

   note which was not placed in MetaVision; it reflects history obtained
   by me and by the CCU team. Assessment and plan is for MICU admission.]
   The patient is an 82 year old male with a history of CRI being set up
   for HD, DM, and HTN who presented after a syncopal episode. The patient
   is being transitioned to HD due to continually worsening renal
   function. He is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1788**] of nephrology, with daily
   kayexalate and frequent electrolyte monitoring. By report, the patient
   has not had his usual daily bowel movements for 3 days and had missed a
   scheduled lab check on the day of presentation due to the snow.
   .
   On the morning of presentation, the patient awoke nauseous and not
   feeling well, got up to go to the bathroom and felt dizzy. He was
   witnessed by his family to syncopize, and was unresponsive for a few
   minutes. Following the event, he continued to feel light headed and
   nauseous. The patient complained of low back pain throughout the day.
   It was unclear if this was due to trauma. EMS was called, evidently
   after a pre-syncopal event (per second-hand account of patient
   grandson) on the evening of presentation; he had not clearly worsened
   during the day before that according to his grandson. When EMS arrived
   the patient continued to vomit, his HR was 80, BP 90/50, and he was
   taken to [**Hospital3 **].
   .
   At [**Hospital3 **], the patient was found to be in a junctional
   bradycardia as low as 15; he had a BP 105/70, Cr of 3.5, and K was 6.5.
   He got 0.5 of atropine, then 1mg of atropine without effect.
   Transcutaneous pacer pads were used, but due to concern of low blood
   pressure, no sedation was given, and shocks were discontinued when they
   did not capture. The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] CCU for
   transvenous pacing.
   .
   On transport, Mr [**Known lastname 4518**]
s HR remained 18-20 with SBP of 105-147, with an
   oxygen saturation of 92% on a NRB. On arrival to the floor, the patient
   was found to be minimally responsive with labored breathing. An ABG was
   obtained, with a gas of 7.02/43/102, potassium of 7.3, and lactate of
   7.0. Ten (10) units of insulin and 50ml of dextrose were administered.
   The patient's breathing became increasingly agonal, and bag ventilation
   was intiated. His pulse became thready and systolic blood pressures
   dropped into the 60s. Dopamine was started, and quickly up titrated to
   20. The patient was by this time in PEA arrest and a code blue was
   called. The patient was ultimately intubated. With absent pulse, chest
   compressions were intiated. The patient received a total of 3 amps of
   atropine, 2 pushes of epi, 2g of calcium, and 2 amps of bicarb. The
   patient regained a normal HR at 80 and BP of 120/50.
   Renal was emergently consulted. A temporary HD line was placed and CVVH
   was initiated. He was difficult to ventilate initially until it was
   recognized that he had a right mainstem bronchus intubation; his ETT
   was pulled back and his oxygenation improved. Since then, by report he
   has remained stable on the ventilator. He had a CT scan of his abdomen
   for which a preliminary read suggested colitis and pancreatitis without
   contrast extravasation into the peritoneum. When he was transferred to
   the MICU he remained on dopamine as a pressor but the nursing staff
   were soon able to stop this, after which his pressures remain stable
   and MAPS remained >65.

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Patient is an 82 year old Vietnamese man w/ hx of DM, HTN, stage 4 CKD
   who presented after syncopal event with junctional bradycardia and
   hyperkalemia.
   # Hypotension: Mr [**Known lastname 4518**] was hypotensive in the CCU, even after his
   hyperkalemia and bradycardia were corrected. He had a high lactate. His
   CT scan included findings of possible pancreatitis (supported by high
   pancreatic enzymes) and colitis (which might be source of high but now
   lower lactate).  His lactate is declining which is reassuring; however,
   his pancreatic enzymes are rising and fluid balance will need to be
   watched closely. Sepsis may have been an underlying issue; cultures are
   pending.
   -- q6h Hct and chem.7 as measures of hydration status in context of
   pancreatitis
   -- BP stable for now
   -- discuss fluid balance and dialysis vs fluid boluses + diuresis with
   renal fellow as necessary; currently putting out urine and holding
   normal blood pressure
   -- vanc/zosyn as empiric treatment for first 48 hours in setting of
   high lactate; cultures pending; hope to narrow coverage or remove it if
   lactate appears to be result of poor perfusion only; renal failure
poor perfusion without infection remains the most economical
   explanation
   # Bradycardia: Mr [**Known lastname 4518**] was transferred to the [**Hospital1 19**] CCU from [**Hospital1 **] originally because of bradycardia refractory to transcutaneous
   pacing attempts. The bradycardia was in the setting of severe
   hyperkalemia, and although he first had a PEA cardiac arrest requiring
   resuscitation, his arrythmias resolved after correction of potassium in
   the [**Hospital1 19**] CCU. Agree with CCU assessment that potassium level is likely
   source of his original bradycardia and likely his syncopal and
   pre-syncopal events described by his family.
   -- correct potassium, follow K q 6 for first 24 hours, q12 thereafter
   if stable
   -- no need for pacing currently, keeping on telemetry and pacer pads
   are available if necessary
   # Hyperkalemia: Patient had failed to get labs checked and kayexelate
   was not producing usual BM. Presented with K of 7.3, and likely
   etiology of patients arrythmia, which had corrected with short term
   interventions. Patient
s symptoms of dizziness, nausea, and vomiting
   likely secondary to uremia/hyperkalemia given timing, though underlying
   infection is a possibility. HD line was placed in CCU and dialysis was
   conducted. Currently a clot in line, RNs are working to resolve; will
   check regular lytes.
   - Patient got CVVH today and this evening
   - hold home kayexalate unless CVVH not avail
   - renal following
   # CKD: Secondary to DM/HTN and being transitioned to HD with ESRD.
   Likely contributing to hyperkalemia [**1-13**] ineffective kayexalate.
   - cont CVVH
   - renal following
   - holding renagel
   # Back Pain: Given elevated lactate and reported complaints of [**9-20**]
   back pain in CCU or prior, concerning for bowel ischemia, pancreatitis,
   or aortic dissection. Patient with adequate DP pulses. CT scan done
   today suggests colitis and pancreatitis. Lactate suggests resolving
   tissue perfusion defect c/w bowel ischemia. Follow lactate closely.
   Likely will need f/u CT scan unless clinical improvement becomes
   obvious; if remaining intubated this may be difficult.
   - follow serial lactate
   - follow cultures
   - follow pancreatic enzymes
   # Respiratory Distress: Patient with agonal breathing on presentation,
   poor oxygenation with large A-a gradient. ?Cerebral component from PEA
   arrest. Oxygenation appears to already be improving.
   - attempt to wean sedation, move to PS to assess pt
s independent
   respiratory drive
   - continue mechanical ventilation
   - CXR in am
   # DM: Patient on glyburide as an outpatient. Patient had glucose of 606
   in CCU with consistent hyperglycemia; may be secondary to pancreatic
   injury.
   - insulin gtt for this acute period, follow total insulin requirements

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 82 year old Vietnamese man w/ hx of DM, HTN, stage 4 CKD
   s/p PEA arrest in the setting of bradycardia, hyerkalemia, currently
   intubated but awake alert.
   # Hypotension: Mr [**Known lastname 4518**] was hypotensive in the CCU, even after his
   hyperkalemia and bradycardia were corrected. He had a high lactate. His
   CT scan included findings of possible pancreatitis (supported by high
   pancreatic enzymes) and colitis (which might be source of high but now
   lower lactate).  His lactate is declining which is reassuring; however,
   his pancreatic enzymes are rising and fluid balance will need to be
   watched closely. Sepsis may have been an underlying issue; cultures are
   pending.
   -- q6h Hct and chem.7 as measures of hydration status in context of
   pancreatitis
   -- BP stable for now
   -- discuss fluid balance and dialysis vs fluid boluses + diuresis with
   renal fellow as necessary; currently putting out urine and holding
   normal blood pressure
   -- vanc/zosyn as empiric treatment for first 48 hours in setting of
   high lactate; cultures pending; hope to narrow coverage or remove it if
   lactate appears to be result of poor perfusion only; renal failure
poor perfusion without infection remains the most economical
   explanation
   # Bradycardia: Mr [**Known lastname 4518**] was transferred to the [**Hospital1 19**] CCU from [**Hospital1 **] originally because of bradycardia refractory to transcutaneous
   pacing attempts. The bradycardia was in the setting of severe
   hyperkalemia, and although he first had a PEA cardiac arrest requiring
   resuscitation, his arrythmias resolved after correction of potassium in
   the [**Hospital1 19**] CCU. Agree with CCU assessment that potassium level is likely
   source of his original bradycardia and likely his syncopal and
   pre-syncopal events described by his family.
   -- correct potassium, follow K q 6 for first 24 hours, q12 thereafter
   if stable
   -- no need for pacing currently, keeping on telemetry and pacer pads
   are available if necessary
   # Hyperkalemia: Patient had failed to get labs checked and kayexelate
   was not producing usual BM. Presented with K of 7.3, and likely
   etiology of patients arrythmia, which had corrected with short term
   interventions. Patient
s symptoms of dizziness, nausea, and vomiting
   likely secondary to uremia/hyperkalemia given timing, though underlying
   infection is a possibility. HD line was placed in CCU and dialysis was
   conducted. Currently a clot in line, RNs are working to resolve; will
   check regular lytes.
   - Patient got CVVH today and this evening
   - hold home kayexalate unless CVVH not avail
   - renal following
   # CKD: Secondary to DM/HTN and being transitioned to HD with ESRD.
   Likely contributing to hyperkalemia [**1-13**] ineffective kayexalate.
   - cont CVVH
   - renal following
   - holding renagel
   # Back Pain: Given elevated lactate and reported complaints of [**9-20**]
   back pain in CCU or prior, concerning for bowel ischemia, pancreatitis,
   or aortic dissection. Patient with adequate DP pulses. CT scan done
   today suggests colitis and pancreatitis. Lactate suggests resolving
   tissue perfusion defect c/w bowel ischemia. Follow lactate closely.
   Likely will need f/u CT scan unless clinical improvement becomes
   obvious; if remaining intubated this may be difficult.
   - follow serial lactate
   - follow cultures
   - follow pancreatic enzymes
   # Respiratory Distress: Patient with agonal breathing on presentation,
   poor oxygenation with large A-a gradient. ?Cerebral component from PEA
   arrest. Oxygenation appears to already be improving.
   - attempt to wean sedation, move to PS to assess pt
s independent
   respiratory drive
   - continue mechanical ventilation
   - CXR in am
   # DM: Patient on glyburide as an outpatient. Patient had glucose of 606
   in CCU with consistent hyperglycemia; may be secondary to pancreatic
   injury.
   - insulin gtt for this acute period, follow total insulin requirements

 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of ET tube placement.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to prior study obtained the same day
 earlier at 4:15 a.m.

 The ET tube tip is currently in the right main bronchus with its tip
 approximately 2.5 cm below the carina and should be pulled back for about
 4.5-5 cm.  A left lower lobe atelectasis is a new finding and most likely is
 secondary to one lung intubation.  Small amount of left pleural effusion is
 present.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no appreciable right pleural
 effusion.  There is no evidence of failure.

   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4273**] is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2,
   tracheobronchomalacia s/p tracheal Y stenting earlier this year
   presents with witnessed PEA arrest at friend's workplace. Per family,
   friend reported that patient ""appeared to be asleep."" This did not
   immediately raise concern because the patient falls asleep frequently
   during the day, even in social situations. His wife notes that he was
   more somnolent than usual this morning; he had a hard time getting out
   of bed. He went to breakfast with friends as per his usual routine, and
   he actually fell asleep at the restaurant as well. Once he slumped
   forward EMS was called. He was down for approximately four minutes
   prior to initiation of CPR. Apparently, his initial rhythm on EMS
   arrival was PEA, and he received 1 mg epinephrine and 1 mg atropine. He
   also received 300 mg amiodarone but it is unclear whether this was
   given first or subsequent to other medications. On tracings from EMS,
   appears that patient is intermittently paced which is wide complex and
   this may have been mistaken for VT. Reportedly, he had return of pulses
   after 6 minutes of CPR. Two IVs were placed and the patient was
   intubated in the field. Unfortunately, the actual EMS documentation is
   no longer with his chart. He was initially cooled in the field by
   report. [**Hospital **]hospital EKG also concerning for inferior STEMI, but on my
   review, this appears only on paced beats with ST elevations in II and
   III and ST depressions in I.
   .
   On arrival to the ED, the patient's initial vitals were T 95.1, HR 60
   (paced), BP 80/40, O2 100%. Blood pressures decreased to the 60s;
   cooling was stopped. Right femoral CVL was placed for IV access. He was
   placed on dopamine gtt with persistent hypotension and levophed was
   added. FAST exam was negative. He also required epinephrine gtt to
   maintain blood pressures in the 90s systolic. CT
   head/neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed bilateral lower lobe
   infiltrates concerning for aspiration versus pneumonia. He received IV
   ceftriaxone 1 g X 1 (but not vancomycin which was also ordered in the
   ED). A left radial arterial line as placed. On CT scan, his ETT was
   noted to be anterior to his tracheal stent. IP and anesthesia/critial
   care were called to the bedside where bronchoscopy was used to
   reposition the tube; the ETT is now located within the stent about 2.5
   cm above the carina. Cardiology was consulted from the ED; they did not
   feel that his presentation was consistent with acute STEMI. ECHO
   performed at the bedside showed preserved EF (> 55%) with no regional
   wall motion abnormalities.
   .
   On arrival to the ICU, the patient is not sedated but is intubated and
   unresponsive to voice and painful. On further questioning, the
   patient's wife notes that the patient has had a cough productive of
   sputum for the past few months; he has been treated intermittently with
   antibiotics for this. She reports no recent fevers at home. The patient
   did not have any other particular complaints in the past few days. As
   above, he was more somnolent on the morning of this incident. Overall,
   the patient's family admits that they know little about his medical
   history because the patient did not share his medical problems. The
   most recent medication list that the patient's wife can find is from

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # PEA arrest: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From family
   history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day. This could
   be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be exacerbated by
   patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could hypothesize that
   patient took additional narcotics which depressed his already-tenuous
   respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia which led to PEA
   arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on admit not
   necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - support respiratory failure as below
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - treat other issues as below
   - continually reassess neurologic status
   .
   # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related to
   profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia. Following
   aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on arrival
   to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source (did have
   leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source is
   infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac function
   (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less suspicion
   for cardiac shock.
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
   - obtain records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting
   - send sputum culture
   - add on urine legionella antigen
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - obtain records from PCP to establish recent Cr baseline
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. Not currently on any
   sedation and will wait for mental status to improve prior to giving any
   narcotics or benzos, etc.
   .
   # FEN: npo for now as no NG, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: ppi, bowel meds, pneumoboots for now (? heparin allergy)

   # ACcess: R IJ CVL, left radial arterial line

s note from today, including the assessment and plan. I
   would emphasize and add the following points: 62 yo M with multiple med
   problems (DM, obesity,severe OSA noncompliant, cadaveric AVR x 2, CRF,
   COPD with TBM w/ Y-stent on home O2 (noncompliant) and chronic pain on
   narcotics) admitted [**12-19**] after PEA arrest. CT a/p neg for PE,
   dissection. Course c/b severe hypotension requiring triple pressors,
   severe hypoxia (PaO2 64 on FIO2 1.0 on arrival), ? ARF on chronic
   (2.3), leukocytosis and bandemia. ETT initially malpositioned given
   stent then repositioned bronchoscopically through stent.  Echo in ED
   showed hyperdynamic LV, no evidence of focal WMA to suggest NSTEMI.  R
   IJ Central line/a-line placed. Weaned off pressors overnight. Broadly
   covered with vanco/cefepine.

   hypercarbic resp failure (hypercarbic and hypoxic at baseline with
   known severe OSA and noncompliance and chronic use of narcotics), no

         ?acute on CRI
         resp failure
         DM/hyperglycemia
   Agree with plan to continue aggressive supportive care. Leukocytosis
   and bandemia likely stress response, though issue of sepsis remains.
   Will continue broad empiric antibx (vanco/cef for now) pending cx
   data. C.diff also in ddx given recent antibxs though with no evidence
   of cholitis on abd ct, no diarrhea, and leukocytosis trending down on
   current treatment.  Trend CEs
mild trop elevation likely from renal
   insufficiency. Renally dose meds and obtain OSH records as unclear if
   chronic and at baseline or acute on CRI given sever hypotension on
   arrival and in cardiac arrest setting.  Making good urine. CVP 16- on
   peep 10. Continue to follow and reassess in am--consider gentle
   diuresis. Holding antihtn meds for now--if BP trends up will slowly
   resume. Resp failure
oxygenating well on 10 peep and 50% fio2 with
   stable airway pressures on PCV.  Consider transitioning back to ACV and
   weaning as tolerated following abgs. Would start insulin gtt for
   hyperglycemia to maintain control 80-120. On initial presentation
   appeared grim prognosis from neuro standpoint, but seems to be making
   slow neuro recovery.  Will continue to monitor with serial neuron exams
   and consider repeat neuro imaging in 24-48 hrs.  Would continue
   propofol for sedation for now for ability to closely monitor neuro exam
   though if prolonged vent needs would transition to fent/versed.
   Imaging suggests some type of esoph stent.  Discuss with radiology and
   obtain OSH records to further assess.  Difficulty placing NGT--may need
   GI help with endoscopic placement.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scan of the head was obtained without the
 administration of contrast.  Axial, coronal, and sagittal reformatted images
 were prepared.

 FINDINGS:  No prior examinations are available for comparison.  There is no
 evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or recent infarction.
 Prominence of the ventricles and sulci likely reflects generalized atrophy,
 age related.  Periventricular and subcortical confluent white matter
 hypodensity likely represents sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic
 disease.

 No concerning osseous lesion is seen.  The visualized paranasal sinuses are
 clear.  Incidental note is made of prior bilateral ocular lens surgery.

 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial process.

 CT HEAD:  Axial imaging was performed through the brain without IV contrast.
 Sagittal and coronal reformats were performed.

 COMPARISON:  None available.

 FINDINGS:  There are multifocal areas of hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe
 (2A:21, 16) measuring 21 x 10 mm and 27 x 9 mm respectively.  There is
 extensive vasogenic edema surrounding these areas of hemorrhage.  There is
 subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as layering in the sylvian fissure and in the
 gyri and sulci of the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes.  Hypoattenuation
 is seen in the left occipital lobe (2A:19).  There is marked edema of the left
 hemisphere with compression of the lateral ventricle and 7 mm rightward shift
 of normally midline structures.  Basilar cisterns appear patent.  No
 hemorrhage or infarct is identified in the right hemisphere.

 Osseous structures appear intact.  There is partial opacification of the
 posterior nasal passages which may reflect the patient's intubated status.
 The globes and orbits are intact.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Probable hemorrhagic conversion of MCA territorial infarct.  PCA

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82M s/p cardiac arrest x 2 of unclear etiology, now
   hypotensive and unresponsive.
   Recommendations:
   1. Evaluation of etiology of arrest as per primary clinical team. Given
   hx anticoagulation and asymmetric pupils, would obtain CT head to
   exclude ICH as etiology for arrest when stable for transport off unit.
   2. Neuroprotective strategies:
   - Agree with therapeutic hypothermia, with goal temp 33-34 degrees via
   Arctic Sun x 24 hrs post arrest, rewarm as per protocol
   - Q4h lytes, coags while being cooled
   - Once rewarmed would avoid hyperthermia (can continue to use Arctic
   Sun pads for this purpose if necessary)
   - Keep HOB elevated 30 degrees to decrease ICP
   - Avoid hyperglycemia, maintain euglycemia
   - Keep magnesium normal
   - Given hx asthma/COPD, pt may have slightly higher baseline pCO2,
   would NOT recommend hyperventilation to normocarbia, particularly in
   setting of auto-PEEP earlier
   - EEG now x 48 hrs to evaluate for sz activity --> if sz activity,
   treat with benzodiazepines and obtain immediate Neuro consult
   - Will send email notification to Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (Neurology) for consult
   tomorrow as per routine post-arrest protocol
   3. Shock management: Possibly [**2-26**] post-arrest state and myocardial
   stunning. Team starting to wean down pressors. Currently no evidence of
   auto-peeping on ventilator to contribute to hypoTN. Chest tube placed
   in ED to relieve small R PTX (unlikely to have contributed to arrest or
   shock). Pulmonary embolus less likely given that pt was therapeutic on
   Coumadin, being treated with heparin.
   - Avoid propofol for sedation while labile BP
   - Wean pressors for MAP >60
   - Pt enrolled in blinded RCT of corticosteroids in post-arrest shock
   (hydrocortisone 100 TID vs placebo)

 FINDINGS:

 Comparison is made to the prior study from [**2159-7-29**] at 07:18 hours.  A
 right-sided chest tube is re-positioned to the right apex.  Pneumothorax is
 not well identified and appears to be resolved.  The right lung is relatively
 clear.  Left lung is clear as well.  Heart and mediastinum demonstrate normal
 contours post-CABG.  Left-sided pacer AICD single lead terminates in the right
 ventricle.  Right IJ catheter terminates in superior vena cava.  Endotracheal
 tube terminates in the thoracic inlet.  Nasogastric tube courses below the
 diaphragm but the tip is not seen.

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82M s/p cardiac arrest x 2 of unclear etiology, now
   hypotensive and unresponsive.
   Recommendations:
   1. Evaluation of etiology of arrest as per primary clinical team. Given
   hx anticoagulation and asymmetric pupils, would obtain CT head to
   exclude ICH as etiology for arrest.
   2. Neuroprotective strategies:
   - Agree with therapeutic hypothermia, with goal temp 33-34 degrees via
   Arctic Sun x 24 hrs post arrest, then rewarm as per protocol
   - Q4h lytes, coags while being cooled
   - Once rewarmed would avoid hyperthermia (can continue to use Arctic
   Sun pads for this purpose if necessary)
   - Keep HOB elevated 30 degrees to decrease ICP
   - Avoid hyperglycemia, maintain euglycemia
   - Given hx asthma/COPD, pt may have slightly higher baseline pCO2,
   would NOT recommend hyperventilation to normocarbia
   - EEG now x 48 hrs to evaluate for sz activity --> if sz activity,
   treat with benzodiazepines and obtain Neuro consult
   3. Shock management: Possibly [**2-26**] post-arrest state and myocardial
   stunning. Team starting to wean down pressors. Currently no evidence of
   auto-peeping on ventilator to contribute to hypoTN. Chest tube placed
   in ED to relieve small R PTX (unlikely to have contributed to arrest or
   shock). Pulmonary embolus less likely given that pt was therapeutic on
   Coumadin, being treated with heparin.
   - Avoid propofol for sedation while labile BP
   - Wean pressors for MAP >60
   - Pt enrolled in blinded RCT of corticosteroids in post-arrest shock
   (hydrocortisone 100 TID vs placebo)
   Thank you for this interesting consult, we will continue to follow
   along with you. Please page/call with questions ([**Numeric Identifier 5172**]).

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given
   EMS records, will presume 0200, so cooled until [**2150**]).  Now rewarmed.
   - Q8H lytes
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - order for continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol
   - Formal Neuro consult this AM, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; will have formal
   consultation and recs RE: prognosis & clinical outcomes
   - SW consult
   - Pt enrolled in steroid clinical trial
   - Family meeting this morning
   .
   # Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to ventilate
   with high auto PEEP, PIP.   Patient with h/o asthma and concern for
   bronchospasm on exam.  No h/o COPD per available records.  Improved
   with aggressive broncodilator therapy.
   - repeat CXR
   - Schedule Albuterol / Ipratroprium  &  PRN Albuterol
   .
   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG (unknown anatomy). No localized ischemia
   on ECGs, cardiac enzymes elevated but s/p compressions, however cannot
   exclude ischemic event
   - enzymes trending down, will recheck as needed
   .
   # PUMP: EF 25% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**2158-6-25**] ETT.
   - order for TTE, can get emergently if any hemodynamic
   compromise/evidence of acute ischemia
   .
   # RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity leading
   to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none since. Patient
   therapeutic on prior coumadin.  Discontinued Amiodarone gtt upon

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:52 A.M. ON [**7-30**]

 HISTORY:  Cardiac arrest.  Intubated, right chest tube and IJ line.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**7-29**]:

 Small region of opacification surrounding the right pleural tube is probably
 an indication of fissural placement.  No pneumothorax or appreciable layering
 effusion.  Lungs otherwise clear.  Heart size normal.  ET tube in standard
 placement.  Nasogastric tube can be traced as far as the GE junction, but the
 tip is not distinct and not really localized.  Right jugular line ends in the
 mid SVC.  Transvenous pacer defibrillator lead ends along the floor of the
 right ventricle, with the proximal electrode extending to the superior
 cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax.  Pleural effusion, if any is small, on
 the right.

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given
   EMS records, will presume 0200, so cooled until [**2150**]).  Now rewarmed.
   - Q8H lytes now that pt has been rewarmed
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - order for continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol
   - Formal Neuro consult this AM, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; will have formal
   consultation and recs RE: prognosis & clinical outcomes
   - SW consult for family coping
   - Pt enrolled in steroid clinical trial
   - Family meeting this morning
   .
   # Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to ventilate
   with high auto PEEP, PIP.   Patient with h/o asthma and concern for
   bronchospasm on exam.  No h/o COPD per available records.  Improved
   with aggressive broncodilator therapy.
   - repeat CXR
   - Will move ETT down 3cm and repeat CXR afterwards
   - Adjust mech vent settings (? Increase TV)
   - Schedule Albuterol / Ipratroprium  &  PRN Albuterol
   .
   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG (unknown anatomy). No localized ischemia
   on ECGs, cardiac enzymes elevated but s/p compressions, however cannot
   exclude ischemic event
   - enzymes trending down, will recheck as needed
 none for now
   - Repeat EKG this AM and another tomorrow AM
   .
   # PUMP: EF 25% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**2158-6-25**] ETT.
   - order for TTE, can get emergently if any hemodynamic
   compromise/evidence of acute ischemia
   .
   # RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity leading
   to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none since. Patient
   therapeutic on prior coumadin.  Discontinued Amiodarone gtt upon
   arrival to CCU.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - history of chronic atrial fibrillation; now with changing rhythm on
   telemetry, some AVIR
   .
   # s/p R chest tube for small R apical pneumothorax; now with some
   oozing.  Thoracics following.
   - CXR with side port in chest wall, fine by Thoracics unless develops
   airleak
   - repeat CXR; obtain daily CXR
   - follow chest tube output
   - monitor Hct as chest tube output bloody
   .
   # Asthma: Patient with reported h/o asthma, bronchospastic on exam.
   - aggressive standing neb treatment
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Baseline 1.2.  Likely some component of ATN
   given s/p PEA arrest x 2.  UOP poor.
   - Monitor uop / Cr
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis / Metabolic Acidosis: Patient with mixed acid
   [**Last Name 3300**] problem.  Lactic acidosis.  Also with h/o COPD.
   - Ventilator management with increased Vt
   - Will move ETT down 3cm and repeat CXR afterwards
   - Adjust mech vent settings (? Increase TV) to compensate for
   respiratory acidosis

   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 23**] or health care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   no improvement other than some mild eeg improvement
   hemodynamically less stable - now requiring pressors for hypotension
   no arrhythmias
   continue supportive care including antibiotics and vasopressors
   if no meaningful neurological improvement will discuss withdrawal of
   care - have discussed this plan extensively with wife and son

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.
   - continue cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6 hours warming
   (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given EMS records,
   will presume 0200, so cool until [**2150**])
   - Q4hrs lytes, coags while hypothermic
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - order for continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol
   - contact [**Name (NI) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in Neurology; will have formal consultation and
   recs RE: prognosis & possible clinical outcomes
   - SW consult
   - ED attendings aware RE: enrollment in steroid clinical trial
   .
   # Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to ventilate
   with high auto PEEP, PIP.   Patient with h/o asthma and concern for
   bronchospasm on exam.  No h/o COPD per available records.
   - increase ventilation by increasing RR/TV
   - repeat CXR
   - serial ABGs
   - Schedule Albuterol / Ipratroprium
   - PRN Albuterol
   .
   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG. No localized ischemia on ECGs, no
   elevation in enzymes so far, however cannot exclude ischemic event
   - cycle enzymes Q8hrs
   .
   # PUMP: No prior records in our system, family cannot relay any clear
   details.
   - Obtain outside records
   - order for TTE, can get emergently if any hemodynamic
   compromise/evidence of acute ischemia
   .
   # RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity leading
   to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none since. Patient
   therapeutic on prior coumadin.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - DC amio gtt
   - follow coags
   - Obtain outside records
   .
   # s/p R chest tube for small R apical pneumothorax; now with some
   oozing.
   - consult thoracics for chest tube management
   - repeat CXR; obtain daily CXR
   - follow chest tube output
   - monitor Hct as chest tube output bloody
   .
   # Asthma: Patient with reported h/o asthma, bronchospastic on exam.
   - aggressive standing neb treatment
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline.  Likely some component of ATN
   given s/p PEA arrest x 2.  UOP poor.
   - Obtain prior records to establish baseline
   - Monitor uop / Cr
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis / Metabolic Acidosis: Patient with mixed acid
   [**Last Name 3300**] problem.  Mild lactic acidosis.  No reported h/o COPD.
   - Ventilator management with increased Vt
   - Resuscitate with D5 with 3 amps bicarbonate PRN

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82M s/p cardiac arrest x 2 of unclear etiology, now
   hypotensive and unresponsive.
   Recommendations:
   1. Evaluation of etiology of arrest as per primary clinical team. Given
   hx anticoagulation and asymmetric pupils, would obtain CT head to
   exclude ICH as etiology for arrest.
   2. Neuroprotective strategies:
   - Agree with therapeutic hypothermia, with goal temp 33-34 degrees via
   Arctic Sun x 24 hrs post arrest, then rewarm as per protocol
   - Once rewarmed would avoid hyperthermia (can continue to use Arctic
   Sun pads for this purpose if necessary)
   - Keep HOB elevated 30 degrees to decrease ICP
   - Avoid hyperglycemia, maintain euglycemia
   - Given hx asthma/COPD, pt may have slightly higher baseline pCO2,
   would NOT recommend hyperventilation to normocarbia
   - EEG now x 48 hrs to evaluate for sz activity --> if sz activity,
   treat with benzodiazepines and obtain Neuro consult
   3. Shock management: Possibly [**2-26**] post-arrest state and myocardial
   stunning. Team starting to wean down pressors. Currently no evidence of
   auto-peeping on ventilator to contribute to hypoTN. Pulmonary embolsim
   less likely given that pt was therapeutic on Coumadin, being treated
   with heparin.
   - Avoid propofol for sedation while labile BP
   - Pt enrolled in blinded RCT of corticosteroids in post-arrest shock
   (hydrocortisone 100 TID vs placebo)

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82M s/p cardiac arrest x 2 of unclear etiology, now
   hypotensive and unresponsive.
   Recommendations:
   1. Evaluation of etiology of arrest as per primary clinical team. Given
   hx anticoagulation and asymmetric pupils, would obtain CT head to
   exclude ICH as etiology for arrest when stable for transport off unit.
   2. Neuroprotective strategies:
   - Agree with therapeutic hypothermia, with goal temp 33-34 degrees via
   Arctic Sun x 24 hrs post arrest, rewarm as per protocol
   - Q4h lytes, coags while being cooled
   - Once rewarmed would avoid hyperthermia (can continue to use Arctic
   Sun pads for this purpose if necessary)
   - Keep HOB elevated 30 degrees to decrease ICP
   - Avoid hyperglycemia, maintain euglycemia
   - Keep magnesium normal
   - Given hx asthma/COPD, pt may have slightly higher baseline pCO2,
   would NOT recommend hyperventilation to normocarbia, particularly in
   setting of auto-PEEP earlier
   - EEG now x 48 hrs to evaluate for sz activity --> if sz activity,
   treat with benzodiazepines and obtain immediate Neuro consult
   - Will send email notification to Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (Neurology) for consult
   tomorrow as per routine post-arrest protocol
   3. Shock management: Possibly [**2-26**] post-arrest state and myocardial
   stunning. Team starting to wean down pressors. Currently no evidence of
   auto-peeping on ventilator to contribute to hypoTN. Chest tube placed
   in ED to relieve small R PTX (unlikely to have contributed to arrest or
   shock). Pulmonary embolus less likely given that pt was therapeutic on
   Coumadin, being treated with heparin.
   - Avoid propofol for sedation while labile BP
   - Wean pressors for MAP >60
   - Pt enrolled in blinded RCT of corticosteroids in post-arrest shock
   (hydrocortisone 100 TID vs placebo)

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6

 ______________________________________________________________________________
 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): PBec WED [**2182-11-6**] 1:53 PM
  PFI:  Continued interstitial prominence likely indicating edema.  Persistent
  right lung base interstitial opacity, asymmetric edema versus pneumonia.  New
  left lower lobe opacification may represent atelectasis and small left
  effusion, but developing pneumonia is a consideration.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  60-year-old man with cardiac arrest and persistent fever, concern
 for effusions and pneumonia.

 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph obtained.

 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple chest radiographs ranging from
 [**10-30**] to [**2182-11-5**].

 FINDINGS:  G-tube is seen passing through stomach and out of view.
 Right-sided venous catheter with tip in the middle superior vena cava.  No
 pneumothorax.  Endotracheal tube positioning is stable.  Single-chamber
 pacemaker with leads positioned in the right ventricle.

 Unchanged faint interstitial opacity in right lower lung may represent edema;
 however, infectious process is not excluded.  New left lower lung base
 opacification may represent combination of atelectasis and a small left
 pleural effusion; however, again infectious process cannot be excluded.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Stable mild cardiomegaly.

 IMPRESSION:  Continued interstitial prominence likely indicating edema.
 Persistent right lung base interstitial opacity, asymmetric edema versus
 pneumonia.  New left lower lobe opacification may represent atelectasis and
 small left effusion, but developing pneumonia is a consideration.

 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph.

 COMPARISON:  [**2151-4-4**] at 15:03.

 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is within 4 cm of the carina.  A nasogastric
 tube terminates outside the field of view.  Bilateral parenchymal opacities
 with air bronchograms have improved from [**4-4**] at 15:03.  There is an
 ill-defined opacity in the right upper lung.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal in size.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:

 Moderate pulmonary edema, likely cardiogenic.  This has improved from [**4-4**]
 at 15:03.  Right upper lung opacity is most likely part of the same process,
 attention at follow-up.

   pain; has been having CP for 4 months with activity; but then 2 nights
   ago was moving wood and that produced some severe CP that lasted
   overnight into today; severe, crushing pain, non-radiating, +SOB and
   nausea. He went to [**Location (un) **] ER where he was found to have TropI 67 and
   EKG with q waves inferiorly and signficant R waves V1-V2. He was
   started on aspirin, heparin gtt, nitro gtt and plavix loaded before
   transferring here.
   .
   Per report BP 110/60 but on arrival SBP 80s and tachycardic
   In cath; found LAD chronically occluded (mid) and LCX mid segment had
   thrombus (assumed culprit lesion); tried balloon angioplasty b/c of low
   platelets (didn't want to give stent) but suboptimal results;
   ultimately placed BMS. Could never fully engage RCA; origin may be
   anomalous. Received heparin during procedure (started at OSH). LVEDP
   was elevated but received a lot of dye trying to find RCA.

   After the catheterization, patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 1682**]. About 30-60
   minutes after arrival on the floor, he complained of recurrent chest
   pain, nausea, back pain. SBP was initially in the 100s on arrival on
   the floor but then dropped to the 80s then 70s. Patient was given IVF
   bolus. He then vomitted, became unconscious, went into PEA arrest. CPR
   was started. Was given epinephrine 1 mg. Pulses returned. Patient
   regained consciousness, again vomited coffee-ground emesis. Was
   intubated. Started on dopamine and wide-open IVF. Transferred to CCU.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 50 yo male with h/o HCV presented with NSTEMI,
   received BMS in LCx, then had post-cath chest pain, coded, and had new
   evidence of RCA infarct.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt presented with chest pain; found with very signicant
   elevation in Trop and CK at OSH, discovered to have chronically
   occluded LAD and thrombus in LCX; now s/p BMS to LCX. RCA unable to be
   engaged. Pt received Plavix load and aspirin prior. Post-cath chest
   pain and new ECG findings of ST elevations in III>II and precordial ST
   depressions suggest RCA infarct.
   - start bivalirudin bolus and gtt given thrombocytopenia
   - re-activate cath lab; will attempt emergent catheterization again
   - continue ASA, clopidogrel
   - statin in a.m.
   - BB in a.m. if BP tolerates
   - serial ECGs
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - check TTE
   .
   # PUMP: No known h/o diastolic/systolic function, had elevated LVEDP in
   Cath lab. Hypotension likely due to RCA infarct.
   - IVF and dopamine to maintain BP
   - TTE in a.m.
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, currently tachycardic
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # [**Name (NI) 4909**] Pt with plts 57; baseline unknown. Concern given pt
   started on aspirin/plavix but unable to do balloon angiplasty; thus
   requires clopidogrel.
   - monitor CBC closely
   - call PCP in AM to determine baseline (? if related to HCV)
   .
   # Depression:
   - will restart escitalopram once extubated
   .
   # HCV: Pts LFTs not markedly elevated, T.bili at OSH wnl; pt has
   completed IFN/ribavarin and per report recent viral load undetectable.
   - recheck LFTs
   - monitor for signs of esophageal variceal bleed given coffee ground
   emesis
   - monitor CBC closely; transfuse as needed
   .
   # FEN: NPO while intubated, will consider TF
   .
   # ACCESS: PIV's, L fem line (will need to pull non-sterile femoral line
   once stable)
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS: Pneumoboots for now (as pt with very low plts) , PPI

   thrombus (assumed culprit lesion); tried balloon angioplasty b/c of low
   platelets (didn't want to give stent) but suboptimal results;
   ultimately placed BMS. Could never fully engage RCA; origin may be
   anomalous. Received heparin during procedure (started at OSH). LVEDP
   was elevated but received a lot of dye trying to find RCA.
   .
   After the catheterization, patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 1682**]. About 30-60
   minutes after arrival on the floor, he complained of recurrent chest
   pain, nausea, back pain. SBP was initially in the 100s on arrival on
   the floor but then dropped to the 80s then 70s. Patient was given IVF
   bolus. He then vomitted, became unconscious, went into PEA arrest. CPR
   was started. Was given epinephrine 1 mg. Pulses returned. Patient
   regained consciousness, again vomited coffee-ground emesis. Was
   intubated. Started on dopamine and wide-open IVF. Transferred to CCU.
   ECG showed new ST depression in precordial leads and ST elevations in
   II, III. R-sided ECG showed ST elevations in lateral leads.

   occluded LAD and thrombus in LCX; now s/p BMS to LCX. RCA unable to be
   engaged. Pt received Plavix load and aspirin prior. Post-cath chest
   pain and new ECG findings of ST elevations in III>II and precordial ST
   depressions suggest RCA infarct.
   - start bivalirudin bolus and gtt given thrombocytopenia
   - re-activate cath lab; will attempt emergent catheterization again

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with known CAD, diastolic CHF, HTN, DM,
   dyslipidemia, presents to OSH ED complaining of SOB, arrived in
   extremus and respiratory failure requiring intubation, tachycardic with
   likely SVT with aberrancy, new reduced EF, leukocytosis, four quadrant
   air space opacities on CXR, and relative hypotension concerning for
   distributive vs. cardiogenic shock.
   .
   CORONARIES: Pt with known CAD, initial enzymes at OSH negative, though
   now rising with CK 1872
 7559, in setting of a single 150J shock at
   OSH and no clear ischemic EKG changes.  Pt also with new globally
   reduced EF on bedside echo at OSH and here which may be secondary to
   concurrent acidosis/extreme critical illness.  Most likely not ACS.
   - Can d/c heparin drip as ACS appears unlikely (low MB index, troponin
   rise not unexpected in setting of sepsis)
   - start SC heparin
   - Continue Aspirin daily
   - Continue statin
   - start BB once more hemodynamically stable
   - Trend cardiac enzymes to peak CK
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG in AM
   - Consider cardiac cath once more clinically stable for further
   evaluation
   .
   PUMP: Pt with history of diastolic CHF, now with reduced EF on bedside
   TTE as above, mixed picture ACS/sepsis and metabolic acidosis given
   lactate of 7.0 at OSH and rising cardiac enzymes. MAPs in mid 50's on
   arrival, but patient started on low dose levophed overnight for low
   blood pressures and nadir of 74/38 after initation of fentanyl/versed
   for sedation.  CVP on arrival 12.  Central venous O2 sat 87 on
   admission now 99.  Globally reduced EF [**1-20**] acidosis vs. acute aschemia
   (w/ rising troponins).
   - Formal TTE in AM
   - Responded well to fluid bolus, maintain CVP ~15.
   - Hold on further diuresis with Lasix for now given borderline blood
   pressures and CVP of 12 with low urine output on admission; unclear if
   patient responded to IV Lasix dose given at OSH
   - Hold all antihypertensives for now
   .
   RHYTHM: Currently in sinus rhythm, HR 70's. At OSH was found to be
   tachycardic with wide complex tachycardia felt to be SVT with aberrancy
   based on 12 lead EKG. Pt was shocked x 1 at OSH and loaded with
   amiodarone upon transfer.
   - d/c amiodarone drip
   - beta blockers as needed for rate control as BP tolerates.
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: CXR showing diffuse fluffly pulmonary infiltrates
   concerning for ARDS. Continue A/C mechanical ventilation with low tidal
   volume strategy and PEEP to support increased lung resistance.  Doing
   well with wean.
   - Goal pH >7.3
   - If oxygenation continues to improve with FiO2< 60%, wean down PEEP
   .
   ID: Possible sepsis given leukocytosis, with suspected urinary source,
   though pulmonary source could also be present given increased RLL
   infiltrate on CXR.  Urine legionella negative.
   - Fontinue broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro for
   double gram negative coverage.  Recent hospital and rehab stay makes
   hospital acquired organisms possible.
   - Abdominal ultrasound in AM to evaluate for abscess or other potential
   intraabdominal source of infection
   - F/U blood and urine cultures
   - f/u OSH cultures.
   .
   ACUTE on CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Pt with baseline cr of 1.7, 2.0 at OSH

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with known CAD, diastolic CHF, HTN, DM,
   dyslipidemia, presents to OSH ED complaining of SOB, arrived in
   extremus and respiratory failure requiring intubation, tachycardic with
   likely SVT with aberrancy, new reduced EF, leukocytosis, four quadrant
   air space opacities on CXR, and relative hypotension concerning for
   distributive vs. cardiogenic shock.
   .
   CORONARIES: Pt with known CAD, initial enzymes at OSH negative, though
   now rising with CK 1872
 7559, in setting of a single 150J shock at
   OSH and no clear ischemic EKG changes.  Pt also with new globally
   reduced EF on bedside echo at OSH and here which may be secondary to
   concurrent acidosis/extreme critical illness.  Most likely not ACS.
   - Can d/c heparin drip as ACS appears unlikely (low MB index, troponin
   rise not unexpected in setting of sepsis)
   - start SC heparin
   - Continue Aspirin daily
   - Continue statin
   - start BB once more hemodynamically stable
   - Trend cardiac enzymes to peak CK
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG in AM
   - Consider cardiac cath once more clinically stable for further
   evaluation
   .
   PUMP: Pt with history of diastolic CHF, now with reduced EF on bedside
   TTE as above, mixed picture ACS/sepsis and metabolic acidosis given
   lactate of 7.0 at OSH and rising cardiac enzymes. MAPs in mid 50's on
   arrival, but patient started on low dose levophed overnight for low
   blood pressures and nadir of 74/38 after initation of fentanyl/versed
   for sedation.  CVP on arrival 12.  Central venous O2 sat 87 on
   admission now 99.  Globally reduced EF [**1-20**] acidosis vs. acute aschemia
   (w/ rising troponins).
   - Formal TTE in AM
   - Responded well to fluid bolus, maintain CVP ~15.
   - Hold on further diuresis with Lasix for now given borderline blood
   pressures and CVP of 12 with low urine output on admission; unclear if
   patient responded to IV Lasix dose given at OSH
   - Hold all antihypertensives for now
   .
   RHYTHM: Currently in sinus rhythm, HR 70's. At OSH was found to be
   tachycardic with wide complex tachycardia felt to be SVT with aberrancy
   based on 12 lead EKG. Pt was shocked x 1 at OSH and loaded with
   amiodarone upon transfer.
   - d/c amiodarone drip
   - beta blockers as needed for rate control as BP tolerates.
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: CXR showing diffuse fluffly pulmonary infiltrates
   concerning for ARDS. Continue A/C mechanical ventilation with low tidal
   volume strategy and PEEP to support increased lung resistance.  Doing
   well with wean.
   - Goal pH >7.3
   - If oxygenation continues to improve with FiO2< 60%, wean down PEEP
   .
   ID: Possible sepsis given leukocytosis, with suspected urinary source,
   though pulmonary source could also be present given increased RLL
   infiltrate on CXR.  Urine legionella negative.
   - Fontinue broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro for
   double gram negative coverage.  Recent hospital and rehab stay makes
   hospital acquired organisms possible.
   - Abdominal ultrasound in AM to evaluate for abscess or other potential
   intraabdominal source of infection
   - F/U blood and urine cultures
   - f/u OSH cultures.
   .
   ACUTE on CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Pt with baseline cr of 1.7, 2.0 at OSH
   earlier today, now 2.5 and oliguric, likely related to pre-renal
   hypoperfusion in setting of severe systemic illness and reduced EF.
   UOP improved somewhat after small IVF bolus increasing to > 20 cc/hr
   overnight
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - Follow UOP and consider additional small volume IVF bolus
   - Image kidneys with abdominal ultrasound as above
   - f/u Urine lytes
   .
   DIABETES MELLITUS: Pt with significantly elevated blood sugars at OSH
   and on admission.  Patient with history of type II DM and at risk for
   hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia, though currently blood glucoses
   not ranging above 600.
   - f/u serum ketones
   - IV insulin drip following [**Last Name (un) 72**] protocol to keep serum glucose <150
   - monitor blood glucose q1 hour
   .
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Pt with large gap metabolic acidosis, initial
   lactate at OSH 7, on arrival here improved to 3.2.  Given elevated
   blood sugars, may also be in DKA, though patient with history of type
   II DM, and DKA less likely.   Serum ketones pending. Pt is s/p 1 amp
   sodium bicarb at OSH.  Gap closed this morning, appears to have largely
   resolved.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation and will slowly decrease
   hyperventilation for respiratory compensation.
   - Continue empiric treatment for sepsis as above with continued
   supportive care
   .
   TRANSAMINITIS: Pt with elevated transaminases on admission, likely
   consistent with global critical illness and possibly related to shock
   liver/hypoperfusion.
   - Continue trending LFTs and coags for now
   - Keep MAP > 65 to maintain end organ perfusion
   .

   with improvement after correction of hyperglycemia.  NPO for now.

   HPI:
   Please see CCU H&P for full details.  Briefly this is a 74 year old
   female with CAD s/p DES to LAD in [**2189**] and failed PCI to OM1 in [**2187**],
   dCHF, and CKD presented to an OSH via EMS w/ severe SOB.  There, she
   was found to have a wide complex tachycardia concerning for VT though
   has known LBBB at baseline.  She was emergently intubated for
   respiratory failure (81% per report.  In addition she was given one
   150J shock for presumed VT with unclear results (rhythm strips not

   bilateral pulmonary infiltrates so the patient was also given a dose of
   ceftriaxone/azithromycin for CAP as well as IV lasix for possible fluid
   overload (without effect).  Bedside TTE was performed which, per
   report, showed a reduced EF of approximately 30-35% at the OSH w/ gobal
   dysfunction (down from 60%).  Initial cardiac enzymes were negative. An
   ABG shortly after intubation was 7.15/45/66/16/86% and she remained
   difficult to ventilate requiring 100% FiO2 and PEEP 20. Given her
   continued acidosis on the vent, the patient was given 1 Amp of sodium
   bicarb while in the ED. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU for further
   management.
   .
   In the CCU, repeat TTE showed global LV systolic dysfunction w/ EF of
   30%.  Cardiac enzymes were trended and continued to rise, last trop of
   0.52, CK of 7559, MBI 1.6.  She was initially started on a heparin gtt
   due to concern for ACS, though this was later thought to be more
   consistent with a metabolic process/sepsis, and the heparin gtt was
   discontinued.  Also, on review, rhythm was most likely consistent with
   SVT w/ abberancy, not VT.  Amiodarone was discontinued.  The patient
   remained warm, though not febrile which was thought to be consistent
   distributive shock. She was continued on broadened antibiotics (vanc,
   zosyn, cipro).  She was initially hypotensive so was given levophed
   thought this was subsequently weaned off.  Amiodarone was also
   discontinued.  She rec'd a gentle fluid challenge of 500 cc due to
   decreased UOP and increased her output (up from 30 cc/hr to 60 cc/hr).
   .
   Of note, patient had worsening of her chronic kidney disease from a
   baseline creatinine of 1.5 up to 2.7 thought to be secondary to
   hypoperfusion.  She had a borderline UA at the OSH showing protein and
   blood without ketones or glucose.  Repeat UA here unremarkable. An
   abdominal US was performed to look at kidneys, though the read is still
   pending.
   .
   She was initially ventilated on ARDSnet protocol, though she has
   tolerated a rapid wean of ventilation and is currently on AC 24 40% 500
   w/ 12 of PEEP with a most recent ABG of 7.40/29/111.
   .
   She was also initiated on an insulin gtt due to persistently elevated
   BS in the 400s and significant AG acidosis on admission, now well
   controlled with a closed gap. No ketones or glucosuria.
   .
   Unable to obtain review of systems due to intubation, though on
   questioning, able to indicate that she has L knee pain unchanged from
   prior.

 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE I
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   74 year old female with known CAD, diastolic CHF, HTN, DM,
   dyslipidemia, presents to OSH ED complaining of SOB, arrived in
   extremus and respiratory failure requiring intubation, tachycardic with
   likely SVT with aberrancy, new reduced EF, leukocytosis, four quadrant
   air space opacities on CXR, and relative hypotension concerning for
   distributive shock.
   .
   # Repiratory failure: CXR initially concerning for ARDS, though no
   clear etiology.  CXR this morning appears to be mildly improved. No
   clear infiltrate, and patient denies any SOB prior.  Per son, patient
   is ""prone"" to pneumonia, so this is most likely source of possible
   septic/distributive shock. Also, with significant leukocytosis which
   may be from infection vs stress reaction. Requiring PEEPs >10 to
   maintain oxygenation, but has been able to wean significantly since
   admission.  Patient was alert and awake on transfer to MICU, denies
   fever prior to admission, though son states she was ""cold"" on the days
   leading up to admission. Urine legionella negative.
   - Continue A/C mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume strategy
   and PEEP to support increased lung resistance.
   - Goal pH >7.3
   - Continue to wean ventilation, will consider decreased PEEP now that
   FiO2 is at 40% and oxygenating well
   - Continue to treat for HCAP w/ zosyn, vanc, cipro as had been in house
   in [**Month (only) 8**] and rehab facility up until 3 weeks ago
   - Daily CXR
   - Trend WBC
   - Send sputum culture, follow up blood and urine cultures
   - Follow up cultures from OSH ([**Last Name (un) 2491**])
   - Consider CT torso if no improvement to assess for
   intraabdominal/thoracic source of infection
   # Coronary artery disease: Has history of CAD w/ DES to LAD, now with
   significant troponin leak in the setting of SVT w/ abberancy and shock
   at OSH.  Per cardiology, this is most likely not consistent w/ ACS and
   patient has completed 24H of heparin gtt. MBI not significantly
   elevated.  Likely myocardial stunning/ischemia in the setting of
   sepsis, critical illness and profound acidemia (lactate 7.0 at OSH).
   No clear new ischemic ECG changes.
   - Continue to trend CE until downtrending
   - Continue ASA daily
   - Continue statin
   - BB when HD stable
   - Cards consult prn
   - Repeat ECG in am
   - Consider pRBCs if decreased Hct (goal >25 given CAD and recent
   ischemia), will also improve intravascular volume
   # Global LV systolic HF: Patient now w/ globally reduced EF on TTE with
   elevated CE as above.  Has history of dCHF.  Has been weaned off of
   levophed while in the CCU and has not required fluids to maintain CVP.
   BPs now stable.  Likely [**1-20**] acidemia/critical illness as above. ScVO2
   in CCU was 99 on evening of admission up from 87.
   - Repeat TTE once patient stabilized and is improved from current
   illness to access for any residual deficit
   - Hold antihypertensives for now, restart prn
   .
   # SVT w/ abberancy: Currently in sinus rhythm, HR 70's. At OSH was
   found to be tachycardic with wide complex tachycardia felt to be SVT
   with aberrancy based on 12 lead EKG. Pt was shocked x 1 at OSH and
   loaded with amiodarone upon transfer, since dc'd.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blockers as needed for rate control as BP tolerates; if no blood
   pressure room, consider restarting amiodarone
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Baseline creatinine of around 1.4,
   now up to 2.7.  Patient had been oliguric, but now improved.  Likely in
   the setting of hypoperfusion given globally reduced EF and critical
   illness.
   - Continue to follow urine output, goal >20 cc/hr
   - Urine lytes/eos
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - IVF prn to maintain UOP
   - Consider renal ultrasound if no improvement in creatinine in the
   morning
   .
   # DM type 2:  BS significantly elevated at OSH and in CCU.  Has been on
   insulin gtt since admission with blood sugars now well controlled.
   Initially, was concern for HHS given gap acidosis and elevated FS,
   though no glucosuria.
   - Will transition to home insulin regimen if possible overnight; per
   patient, she takes 35/40 NPH and humalog SS.
   .
   # AG acidosis: GAP now resolved.  Initial lactate at OSH was 7, now
   wnl.  Concern for HHS, though no glucosuria or other metabolic
   derangements.  Serum B hydroxybuterate pending. Pt is s/p 1 amp sodium
   bicarb at OSH.
   - Continue empiric treatment for sepsis as above with continued
   supportive care
   - Continue to follow chem panel, gap/bicarb.  Will recheck now.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Pt with elevated transaminases on admission, likely
   consistent with global critical illness and possibly related to shock
   liver/hypoperfusion.
   - Continue trending LFTs and coags for now
   - Keep MAP > 65 to maintain end organ perfusion
   - Follow up final read of abd ultrasound done in CCU
   .
   # Leg pain: Patient had recent illness with negative work up. Per her
   son, has had significant pain not improved post rehab.  This had been a
   major concern of hers for the few days prior to this admission.  L knee
   was tapped during prior admission, consistent with arthritis.
   - Continue fentanyl while intubated for pain control
   - Consider repeat plain films, ?repeat tap given septic joint could be
   source of current infection
   - Will likely require additional PT, pain control once sedation
   wean/extubated
   .
   # FEN: Will initiate TF once available, nutrition recommendations
   appreciated. IVF boluses as needed as above.  Replete lytes prn
   .

   Initial visit, Cardiology service: CCU
   Presenting complaint: Arrhythmia, (Other: Respiratory failure, CHF)
   History of present illness: 74 year old female with CAD, dCHF, and CKD
   presented to an OSH today after calling EMS complaining of severe
   shortness of breath.  On arrival to the ED the patient was found to be
   tachycardic to 148, BP 140/58, 81% with EKG concerning for possible
   VTach.  Patient does have known LBBB at baselie.  Given tachycardia and
   VTach, the patient was given 150J shock x1 and bolused with
   Amiodarone.  She was also emergently intubated given her respiratory
   failure, and started on ceftriaxone/azithromycin and IV lasix for a CXR
   showing bilatateral pulmonary infiltrates.  An ABG shortly after
   intubation was 7.15/45/66/16/86% and she remained difficult to
   ventilate requiring 100% FiO2 and PEEP 20.  Given her acidosis, the
   patient was also given 1 Amp of sodium bicarb while in the ED.  A
   bedside TTE was performed which, per report, showed a reduced EF of
   ~30-35%, and initial cardiac enzymes were negative.  Given the
   patient's reduced EF, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for further
   management.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with known CAD, diastolic CHF, HTN, DM,
   dyslipidemia, presents to OSH ED complaining of SOB, arrived in
   extremus and respiratory failure requiring intubation, tachycardic with
   likely SVT with aberrancy, new reduced EF, leukocytosis, four quadrant
   air space opacities on CXR, and relative hypotension concerning for
   distributive vs. cardiogenic shock.
   .
   CORONARIES: Pt with known CAD, initial enzymes at OSH negative, though
   now rising, in setting of 150J shock at OSH and no clear ischemic EKG
   changes.  Pt also with globally reduced EF on bedside echo at OSH and
   here which may be secondary to acidosis/extreme critical illness.
   - Continue IV Heparin gtt for possible ACS for now
   - Continue Aspirin daily
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG in AM
   - Continue home dose statin
   - Consider cardiac cath once more clinically stable for further
   evaluation
   .
   PUMP: Pt with history of diastolic CHF, now with reduced EF on bedside
   TTE as above, ACS vs. sepsis/acidosis. MAPs in mid 50's, not currently
   on pressors. CVP 12 with borderline BPs while on sedation.
   - Formal TTE in AM
   - Small 500 IVF bolus given for relative hypotension in setting of CVP
   12; continue small IVF boluses if blood pressures worsens or consider
   presesors as needed
   - Hold on further diuresis with Lasix for now given borderline blood
   pressures and CVP of 12 with low urine output
   - Hold all antihypertensives for now
   - f/u SVo2 from IJ
   .
   RHYTHM: Currently in sinus rhythm, HR 70's. At OSH was found to be
   tachycardic with wide complex tachycardia felt to be SVT with aberrancy
   based on 12 lead EKG. Pt was shocked x 1 at OSH and loaded with
   amiodarone upon transfer.
   - d/c amiodarone drip
   - beta blockers as needed for rate control as BP tolerates; if no blood
   pressure room, consider additional amiodarone boluses at that time
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: CXR showing diffuse fluffly pulmonary infiltrates
   concerning for ARDS. Continue A/C mechanical ventilation with low tidal
   volume strategy and high PEEP given increased lung resistance.
   - Goal pH >7.3
   - Wean Fio2 as tolerated
   - If oxygenation continues to improved, wean down PEEP
   .
   ID: Possible sepsis given leukocytosis, with suspected urinary source,
   though pulmonary source could also be present.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro for
   double gram negative coverage
   - Abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for abscess or other potential
   intraabdominal source of infection
   - F/U blood and urine cultures
   - F/U urine legionella
   .
   ACUTE on CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Pt with baseline cr of 1.7, 2.0 at OSH
   earlier today, now 2.5 and oliguric, likely related to pre-renal
   hypoperfusion in setting of severe systemic illness and reduced EF
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - Follow UOP following small volume IVF bolus
   - Image kidneys with abdominal ultrasound as above
   - f/u Urine lytes
   .
   DIABETES MELLITUS: Pt with significantly elevated blood pressures at
   OSH and on admission, which may be contributing to metabolic gap
   acidosis
   - f/u serum ketones
   - IV insulin drip following [**Last Name (un) 72**] protocol to keep serum glucose <150
   - monitor blood glucose q1 hour
   .
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Pt with large gap metabolic acidosis, initial
   lactate at OSH 7, on arrival here improved to 3.2.  Given elevated
   blood sugars, may also be in DKA, though serum ketones pending. Pt is
   s/p 1 amp sodium bicarb at OSH.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation and increase respiratory rate to
   induce slight hyperventilation to compensate for met. acidosis
   - Continue empiric treatment for sepsis as above with continued
   supportive care
   .
   TRANSAMINITIS: Pt with elevated transaminases on admission, likely
   consistent with global critical illness and possibly related to shock
   liver/hypoperfusion.
   - Continue trending LFTs and coags for now
   .
   FEN: NPO for now.
   - F/u nutrition recs for TF
   .

   History of present illness: 74 year old female with CAD, dCHF, and CKD
   presented to an OSH today after calling EMS complaining of severe
   shortness of breath.  On arrival to the ED the patient was found to be
   tachycardic to 148, BP 140/58, 81% with EKG concerning for possible
   VTach.  Patient does have known LBBB at baselie.  The patient was
   emergently intubated for respiratory failure and was given a 150J shock
   x1 for possible Vtach though rhythm strips from the OSH were
   unavailable on transfer.  In addition, the patient was bolused with
   Amiodarone and started on an amiodarone drip.  A CXR showed diffuse
   bilateral pulmonary infiltrates so the patient was also given a dose of
   ceftriaxone/azithromycin as well as IV lasix for posisble fluid
   overload.  A bedside TTE was performed which, per report, showed a
   reduced EF of approximately 30-35% at the OSH as well.  Initial cardiac
   enzymes were negative.   An ABG shortly after intubation was
   7.15/45/66/16/86% and she remained difficult to ventilate requiring
   100% FiO2 and PEEP 20.  Given her continued acidosis on the vent, the
   patient was given 1 Amp of sodium bicarb while in the ED.  Given the
   patient's complicated presentation, newly reduced EF, and possible
   cardiogenic shock, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU for further
   management and possible intervention.

   Echocardiogram: (Date: [**2194-6-13**]), Moderate global left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction. Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
   Minimal aortic stenosis. Moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
   Mild pulmonary hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with known CAD, diastolic CHF, HTN, DM,
   dyslipidemia, presents to OSH ED complaining of SOB, arrived in
   extremus and respiratory failure requiring intubation, tachycardic with
   likely SVT with aberrancy, new reduced EF, leukocytosis, four quadrant
   air space opacities on CXR, and relative hypotension concerning for
   distributive vs. cardiogenic shock.
   .
   CORONARIES: Pt with known CAD, initial enzymes at OSH negative, though
   now rising with CK 1872
 7559, in setting of a single 150J shock at
   OSH and no clear ischemic EKG changes.  Pt also with new globally
   reduced EF on bedside echo at OSH and here which may be secondary to
   concurrent acidosis/extreme critical illness.
   - Continue IV Heparin gtt for likely ACS given rapidly rising cardiac
   enzymes
   - Continue Aspirin daily
   - Continue statin
   - start BB once more hemodynamically stable
   - Trend cardiac enzymes to peak CK
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG in AM
   - Consider cardiac cath once more clinically stable for further
   evaluation
   .
   PUMP: Pt with history of diastolic CHF, now with reduced EF on bedside
   TTE as above, mixed picture ACS/sepsis and metabolic acidosis given
   lactate of 7.0 at OSH and rising cardiac enzymes. MAPs in mid 50's on
   arrival, but patient started on low dose levophed overnight for low
   blood pressures and nadir of 74/38 after initation of fentanyl/versed
   for sedation.  CVP on arrival 12.  Central venous O2 sat 87 on
   admission now 99
   - Formal TTE in AM
   - Small 500 IVF bolus given for relative hypotension in setting of CVP
   12 with low urine output; CVP increased to 17 following 500 cc IVF;
   consider repeat  small IVF boluses to keep CVP >12 but <18
   - Hold on further diuresis with Lasix for now given borderline blood
   pressures and CVP of 12 with low urine output on admission; unclear if
   patient responded to IV Lasix dose given at OSH
   - Hold all antihypertensives for now
   - f/u SVo2 from IJ as surrogate given no swan
   .
   RHYTHM: Currently in sinus rhythm, HR 70's. At OSH was found to be
   tachycardic with wide complex tachycardia felt to be SVT with aberrancy
   based on 12 lead EKG. Pt was shocked x 1 at OSH and loaded with
   amiodarone upon transfer.
   - d/c amiodarone drip
   - beta blockers as needed for rate control as BP tolerates; if no blood
   pressure room, consider additional amiodarone boluses at that time
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: CXR showing diffuse fluffly pulmonary infiltrates
   concerning for ARDS. Continue A/C mechanical ventilation with low tidal
   volume strategy and PEEP to support increased lung resistance.
   - Goal pH >7.3
   - Wean Fio2 as tolerated to goal <60%
   - If oxygenation continues to improve with FiO2< 60%, wean down PEEP
   .
   ID: Possible sepsis given leukocytosis, with suspected urinary source,
   though pulmonary source could also be present given increased RLL
   infiltrate on CXR.  Urine legionella negative.
   - Fontinue broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro for
   double gram negative coverage
   - Abdominal ultrasound in AM to evaluate for abscess or other potential
   intraabdominal source of infection
   - F/U blood and urine cultures
   .
   ACUTE on CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Pt with baseline cr of 1.7, 2.0 at OSH
   earlier today, now 2.5 and oliguric, likely related to pre-renal
   hypoperfusion in setting of severe systemic illness and reduced EF.
   UOP improved somewhat after small IVF bolus increasing to > 20 cc/hr
   overnight
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - Follow UOP and consider additional small volume IVF bolus
   - Image kidneys with abdominal ultrasound as above
   - f/u Urine lytes
   .
   DIABETES MELLITUS: Pt with significantly elevated blood sugars at OSH
   and on admission.  Patient with history of type II DM and at risk for
   hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia, though currently blood glucoses
   not ranging above 600.
   - f/u serum ketones
   - IV insulin drip following [**Last Name (un) 72**] protocol to keep serum glucose <150
   - monitor blood glucose q1 hour
   .
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Pt with large gap metabolic acidosis, initial
   lactate at OSH 7, on arrival here improved to 3.2.  Given elevated
   blood sugars, may also be in DKA, though patient with history of type
   II DM, and DKA less likely.   Serum ketones pending. Pt is s/p 1 amp
   sodium bicarb at OSH.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation and increase respiratory rate to
   induce slight hyperventilation to compensate for met. acidosis
   - Continue empiric treatment for sepsis as above with continued
   supportive care
   .
   TRANSAMINITIS: Pt with elevated transaminases on admission, likely
   consistent with global critical illness and possibly related to shock
   liver/hypoperfusion.
   - Continue trending LFTs and coags for now
   - Keep MAP > 65 to maintain end organ perfusion
   .
   FEN: Hyponatremia: falsely low given elevated blood glucose on arrival
   with improvement after correction of hyperglycemia.  NPO for now.
   - F/u nutrition recs for TF

   Initial visit, Cardiology service: CCU
   Presenting complaint: Arrhythmia, (Other: Respiratory failure, CHF)
   History of present illness: 74 year old female with CAD, dCHF, and CKD
   presented to an OSH today after calling EMS complaining of severe
   shortness of breath.  On arrival to the ED the patient was found to be
   tachycardic to 148, BP 140/58, 81% with EKG concerning for possible
   VTach.  Patient does have known LBBB at baselie.  Given tachycardia and
   VTach, the patient was given 150J shock x1 and bolused with
   Amiodarone.  She was also emergently intubated given her respiratory
   failure, and started on ceftriaxone/azithromycin and IV lasix for a CXR
   showing bilatateral pulmonary infiltrates.  An ABG shortly after
   intubation was 7.15/45/66/16/86% and she remained difficult to
   ventilate requiring 100% FiO2 and PEEP 20.  Given her acidosis, the
   patient was also given 1 Amp of sodium bicarb while in the ED.  A
   bedside TTE was performed which, per report, showed a reduced EF of
   ~30-35%, and initial cardiac enzymes were negative.  Given the
   patient's reduced EF, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for further
   management.

"880",1897,61030,"Chief Complaint:  Respiratory failure/shock
   HPI:
   Please see CCU H&P for full details.  Briefly this is a 74 year old
   female with CAD s/p DES to LAD in [**2189**] and failed PCI to OM1 in [**2187**],
   dCHF, and CKD presented to an OSH via EMS w/ severe SOB.  There, she
   was found to have a wide complex tachycardia concerning for VT though
   has known LBBB at baseline.  She was emergently intubated for
   respiratory failure (81% per report.  In addition she was given one
   150J shock for presumed VT with unclear results (rhythm strips not
   available). She continued to have wide complex rhythm.  Also got 150mg
   of amio and was started on an amiodarone drip. A CXR showed diffuse
   bilateral pulmonary infiltrates so the patient was also given a dose of
   ceftriaxone/azithromycin for CAP as well as IV lasix for possible fluid
   overload (without effect).  Bedside TTE was performed which, per
   report, showed a reduced EF of approximately 30-35% at the OSH w/ gobal
   dysfunction (down from 60%).  Initial cardiac enzymes were negative. An
   ABG shortly after intubation was 7.15/45/66/16/86% and she remained
   difficult to ventilate requiring 100% FiO2 and PEEP 20. Given her
   continued acidosis on the vent, the patient was given 1 Amp of sodium
   bicarb while in the ED. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU for further
   management.
   .
   In the CCU, repeat TTE showed global LV systolic dysfunction w/ EF of
   30%.  Cardiac enzymes were trended and continued to rise, last trop of
   0.52, CK of 7559, MBI 1.6.  She was initially started on a heparin gtt
   due to concern for ACS, though this was later thought to be more
   consistent with a metabolic process/sepsis, and the heparin gtt was
   discontinued.  Also, on review, rhythm was most likely consistent with
   SVT w/ abberancy, not VT.  Amiodarone was discontinued.  The patient
   remained warm, though not febrile which was thought to be consistent
   distributive shock. She was continued on broadened antibiotics (vanc,
   zosyn, cipro).  She was initially hypotensive so was given levophed
   thought this was subsequently weaned off.  Amiodarone was also
   discontinued.  She rec'd a gentle fluid challenge of 500 cc due to
   decreased UOP and increased her output (up from 30 cc/hr to 60 cc/hr).
   .
   Of note, patient had worsening of her chronic kidney disease from a
   baseline creatinine of 1.5 up to 2.7 thought to be secondary to
   hypoperfusion.  She had a borderline UA at the OSH showing protein and
   blood without ketones or glucose.  Repeat UA here unremarkable. An
   abdominal US was performed to look at kidneys, though the read is still
   pending.
   .
   She was initially ventilated on ARDSnet protocol, though she has
   tolerated a rapid wean of ventilation and is currently on AC 24 40% 500
   w/ 12 of PEEP with a most recent ABG of 7.40/29/111.
   .
   She was also initiated on an insulin gtt due to persistently elevated
   BS in the 400s and significant AG acidosis on admission, now well
   controlled with a closed gap. No ketones or glucosuria.
   .
   Unable to obtain review of systems due to intubation, though on
   questioning, able to indicate that she has L knee pain unchanged from
   prior.

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS, UNSTABLE ANGINA, CORONARY ISCHEMIA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE I
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   74 year old female with known CAD, diastolic CHF, HTN, DM,
   dyslipidemia, presents to OSH ED complaining of SOB, arrived in
   extremus and respiratory failure requiring intubation, tachycardic with
   likely SVT with aberrancy, new reduced EF, leukocytosis, four quadrant
   air space opacities on CXR, and relative hypotension concerning for
   distributive shock.
   .
   # Repiratory failure: CXR initially concerning for ARDS, though no
   clear etiology.  CXR this morning appears to be mildly improved. No
   clear infiltrate, and patient denies any SOB prior.  Per son, patient
   is ""prone"" to pneumonia, so this is most likely source of possible
   septic/distributive shock. Also, with significant leukocytosis which
   may be from infection vs stress reaction. Requiring PEEPs >10 to
   maintain oxygenation, but has been able to wean significantly since
   admission.  Patient was alert and awake on transfer to MICU, denies
   fever prior to admission, though son states she was ""cold"" on the days
   leading up to admission. Urine legionella negative.
   - Continue A/C mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume strategy
   and PEEP to support increased lung resistance.
   - Goal pH >7.3
   - Continue to wean ventilation, will consider decreased PEEP now that
   FiO2 is at 40% and oxygenating well
   - Continue to treat for HCAP w/ zosyn, vanc, cipro as had been in house
   in [**Month (only) 8**] and rehab facility up until 3 weeks ago
   - Daily CXR
   - Trend WBC
   - Send sputum culture, follow up blood and urine cultures
   - Follow up cultures from OSH ([**Last Name (un) 2491**])
   - Consider CT torso if no improvement to assess for
   intraabdominal/thoracic source of infection
   # Coronary artery disease: Has history of CAD w/ DES to LAD, now with
   significant troponin leak in the setting of SVT w/ abberancy and shock
   at OSH.  Per cardiology, this is most likely not consistent w/ ACS and
   patient has completed 24H of heparin gtt. MBI not significantly
   elevated.  Likely myocardial stunning/ischemia in the setting of
   sepsis, critical illness and profound acidemia (lactate 7.0 at OSH).
   No clear new ischemic ECG changes.
   - Continue to trend CE until downtrending
   - Continue ASA daily
   - Continue statin
   - BB when HD stable
   - Cards consult prn
   - Repeat ECG in am
   - Consider pRBCs if decreased Hct (goal >25 given CAD and recent
   ischemia), will also improve intravascular volume
   # Global LV systolic HF: Patient now w/ globally reduced EF on TTE with
   elevated CE as above.  Has history of dCHF.  Has been weaned off of
   levophed while in the CCU and has not required fluids to maintain CVP.
   BPs now stable.  Likely [**1-20**] acidemia/critical illness as above. ScVO2
   in CCU was 99 on evening of admission up from 87.
   - Repeat TTE once patient stabilized and is improved from current
   illness to access for any residual deficit
   - Hold antihypertensives for now, restart prn
   .
   # SVT w/ abberancy: Currently in sinus rhythm, HR 70's. At OSH was
   found to be tachycardic with wide complex tachycardia felt to be SVT
   with aberrancy based on 12 lead EKG. Pt was shocked x 1 at OSH and
   loaded with amiodarone upon transfer, since dc'd.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blockers as needed for rate control as BP tolerates; if no blood
   pressure room, consider restarting amiodarone
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Baseline creatinine of around 1.4,
   now up to 2.7.  Patient had been oliguric, but now improved.  Likely in
   the setting of hypoperfusion given globally reduced EF and critical
   illness.
   - Continue to follow urine output, goal >20 cc/hr
   - Urine lytes/eos
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - IVF prn to maintain UOP
   - Consider renal ultrasound if no improvement in creatinine in the
   morning
   .
   # DM type 2:  BS significantly elevated at OSH and in CCU.  Has been on
   insulin gtt since admission with blood sugars now well controlled.
   Initially, was concern for HHS given gap acidosis and elevated FS,
   though no glucosuria.
   - Will transition to home insulin regimen if possible overnight; per
   patient, she takes 35/40 NPH and humalog SS.
   .
   # AG acidosis: GAP now resolved.  Initial lactate at OSH was 7, now
   wnl.  Concern for HHS, though no glucosuria or other metabolic
   derangements.  Serum B hydroxybuterate pending. Pt is s/p 1 amp sodium
   bicarb at OSH.
   - Continue empiric treatment for sepsis as above with continued
   supportive care
   - Continue to follow chem panel, gap/bicarb.  Will recheck now.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Pt with elevated transaminases on admission, likely
   consistent with global critical illness and possibly related to shock
   liver/hypoperfusion.
   - Continue trending LFTs and coags for now
   - Keep MAP > 65 to maintain end organ perfusion
   - Follow up final read of abd ultrasound done in CCU
   .
   # Leg pain: Patient had recent illness with negative work up. Per her
   son, has had significant pain not improved post rehab.  This had been a
   major concern of hers for the few days prior to this admission.  L knee
   was tapped during prior admission, consistent with arthritis.
   - Continue fentanyl while intubated for pain control
   - Consider repeat plain films, ?repeat tap given septic joint could be
   source of current infection
   - Will likely require additional PT, pain control once sedation
   wean/extubated
   .
   # FEN: Will initiate TF once available, nutrition recommendations
   appreciated. IVF boluses as needed as above.  Replete lytes prn
   .

   Critical Care Attending
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   resident for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with
   his/her note above, including the assessment and plan. I would
   add/emphasize the following:
   Briefly, Mrs. [**Known lastname 2576**] is 74 w/h/o DM, Br CA in distant past, OSA,
   CAD, diastolic chf, transferred from OSH for SOB, wide complex
   tachycardia ?VT vs SVT w/aberrancy and shock picture (?cardiogenic vs
   septic). At OSH intubated for hypoxemia/ shocked when tachycardic
   w/150J. Initially tx'd w/amio bolus and gtt, diffuse bilat pulm
   infiltrates tx for pna and tx for CHF w/lasix. Global LV dysfxn on
   ECHO, CK leak w/trop 3.5, hypoperfusion creat 2.5, Transferred to CCU
   at [**Hospital1 5**] for treatment of ?cardiogenic shock. In CCU, sense was of more
   septic physiology than cardiogenic problems. 7.4/29/111 - [**Name2 (NI) **]n gtt,
   anion gap closed. Turned off amio for svt w/aberrancy.
   Transferred to MICU from CCU for further vent management. Overnight
   intermittently tachy to 120's, broke from SVT with vagal maneuvers and
   / or iv metoprolol. Given U PRBC for HCT 23. On exam now, elderly woman
   in no distress. Tm 100.5, HR 70-132, RR 17-27, AC 500 x 18 Peep 12
   7.36/29/118. Intubated. Lungs CTA [**1-24**] syst murmur, nt abd +bs, 1+
   edema. WBC 13 HCT 24.7 K 4.5, BuN 53/2.7 Trop 2.0
   In summary, critically ill elderly woman with respiratory failure
   likely due to diastolic heart failure in setting of tachycardia.
   Initial injury unclear, but possibly infectious/septic etiology. We
   will decrease sedation, change to PSV, reduce PEEP and gently diurese
   as BP allows. Will try to resume beta blockade for diastolic
   dysfunction and SVT. If not tolerating beta blockers, consider amio.
   Continue broad spectrum antibiotics pending cultures. Renal failure
   improving and likely from hypoperfusion. BS control w/insulin. Full
   code.
   Patient remains critically ill.

"882",1898,61076,"Pt is a 67 year old man with PMH DM and HTN, who was found slumped over
   in his car by a police officer.  AED was hooked up and the patient was
   reportedly shocked for VF/VT arrest.   He was intubated in the field,
   started on lidocaine gtt, and taken to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 608**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 73**] where cooling protocol
   was initiated and he was changed to amiodarone.  His ECG showed sinus
   tachycardia, as well as a possible atrial tachycardia, without evidence
   of ST elevations or ischemia, and initial troponin was 0.03 with flat
   CK.  He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 19**] CCU for further care.  Currently,
   he is intubated and sedated, with his wife being directed to the CCU
   for more information about his history.  Plan to continue amiodarone
   gtt , observe overnight, trend enzymes, and continue cooling protocol.

                                 FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
 INDICATION:  67-year-old male status post ventricular fibrillation arrest,
 found down with unequal pupils.  Evaluate for acute process.

 COMPARISON:  No prior study available for comparison.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain.  No
 contrast was administered.

 FINDINGS:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, major vascular
 territorial infarction, mass effect, or edema.  The [**Doctor Last Name 181**]-white matter
 differentiation is preserved.  There are basal ganglia calcifications.  The
 ventricles and sulci are normal in size and appearance.  There is an air-fluid
 level in the right sphenoid sinus and mild mucosal thickening in the bilateral
 ethmoids.  The remainder of the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
 cells are well aerated. There is evidence of prior left lens surgery.  No
 osseous abnormality is identified.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  No acute intracranial abnormality.

 2.  Air-fluid level in the sphenoid sinus and mild ethmoid mucosal thickening.
 Clinical correlation recommended.

 Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 64803**] [**Name (STitle) **] at 11:55 p.m. on [**2148-1-16**].

 NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is some loss of the normal [**Doctor Last Name 181**]-white
 matter differentiation, diffusely, and likely sulcal effacement over the
 convexities (given the patient's age), suggestive of diffuse cerebral edema.
 The ventricles and cisterns are preserved, and there is no evidence of
 herniation. As above, there is no hemorrhage or sign of vascular territorial
 infarction.

 As discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6531**], the houseofficer caring for the patient (11
 AM, [**2148-1-17**]), repeat NECT (once warming treatment has been completed) may be
 warranted, given that the patient is paralyzed and sedated .

   witness to have a rear end collision by police who then found  him
   slumped over in his car by  police .  AED was hooked up and the patient
   was reportedly shocked for VF/VT arrest rhythm not confirmed.   He was
   intubated in the field, started on lidocaine gtt, and taken to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 608**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 73**] where cooling protocol was initiated and he was changed to
   amiodarone. They placed an I/O line in right knee.   His ECG showed
   sinus tachycardia, as well as a possible atrial tachycardia, without
   evidence of ST elevations or ischemia, and initial troponin was 0.03
   with flat CK.  He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 19**] CCU for further care.
   He was placed on Artic sun upon arrival and reached Goal cooling of 34
   degrees Celsius at ten PM [**2148-1-16**]. He was paralyzed at 9 pm for
   ventilator dysynchrony and likely shivering. Pt o2 sats were marginal
   however after paralytic was added his sats came up to 100 percent and
   we were able to wean FIO@ from 100 to 50 and PEEP is also being weaned
   was at 15 now 12.  Pt was restless and moving around at start of shift,

"896",1898,61076,"SOCIAL WORK:  Pt referred to SW as part of cardiac arrest response
   team.  Pt is a 67 year old man with PMH of DM and HTN, who was found
   slumped over in his car by a police officer with apparent cardiac
   arrest.  Pt is currently on CCU with Arctic Sun protocol.  SW met with
   pt
s wife, [**Name (NI) 2057**], and 2 sons in family waiting area.  Pt has 2 other
   children who stayed over night and returned home to bathe and have
   change of clothes, planning to return today.  Wife and sons verbalized
   good understanding of pt
s medical situation, and now awaiting further
   testing, etc.  They express understanding testing and observation takes
   time, and that they are challenged with having to wait to have more
   complete understanding of pt
s situation.  Family reports having very
   good communication with the team, and are very complimentary re; all
   aspects of pt
s care.  Wife states they are holding out hope, and feel
   pt
is in good hands.
      Family members are mutually supportive, and
   welcome visits from larger extended family.  Wife and children planning
   to stay in hospital again overnight.  SW educated re: importance of
   self care, but also normalized their feelings of wanting to be at
   bedside as much as possible.  Role of SW explained.
   SW will continue to follow with team to support family coping.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 CARDIAC ARREST
   Assessment: 67 M s/p VF arrest, intubated and unresponsive.
   Recommendations for Neuroprotection:
   1. Therapeutic Hypothermia: Pt appears to be eligible for cooling with
   Arctic Sun, as he is comatose post-arrest, with stable hemodynamics and
   no evidence of active hemorrhage.
   - Initiate TH with Arctic Sun goal temp 34 degrees C x 24 hours then
   rewarm as per protocol
   -
   2. Avoid elevated ICP: Keep HOB elevated greater than 30 degrees at all
   times; maintain goal pCO2 35-40.
   3. Monitor for seizure activity via continuous 48h EEG monitoring
   Will continue to follow along, please call/page with any questions.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo M with DM, HTN presents following VF-arrest s/p shock x1 with
   conversion to sinus tach and initiated on arctic sun cooling protocol.
   .
   # RHYTHM: pt found in VF arrest, down time was brief for a few minutes.
   He was shocked x1 with conversion to sinus tach.   He was started on
   amiodarone and initiated on artic sun cooling.  He reached cooling temp
   at 10pm last night.  No clear h/o ischemia, heart failure, LVH,
   structural heart disease or prior arrhythmia that might have caused his
   VF arrest.  However, given cardiac risk factors pt likely with
   underlying cardiac disease.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 CARDIAC ARREST
   Assessment: 67 M s/p VF arrest, intubated and unresponsive.
   Investigation of the etiology of arrest as per primary team.
   Recommendations for Neuroprotection:
   1. Therapeutic Hypothermia: Pt appears to be eligible for cooling with
   Arctic Sun, as he is comatose post-arrest, with stable hemodynamics and
   no evidence of active hemorrhage.
   - Initiate TH with Arctic Sun goal temp 34 degrees C x 18 hours then
   rewarm as per protocol over next 6 hrs
   - While cooled, monitor coags and lytes q8 hours
   - Hypothermia can cause bradycardia so monitor for this
   - If having difficulty reaching goal temp, can utilize sedation, and if
   needed can use paralytic (try bolus dosing first, then gtt if needed)
   - Given slight pupil asymmetry noted on initial exam, would consider
   stat head CT as discussed at time of initial evaluation with residents
   2. Avoid elevated ICP: Keep HOB elevated greater than 30 degrees at all
   times; maintain goal pCO2 35-40.
   3. Monitor for seizure activity via continuous 48h EEG monitoring:
   Order protocol for EEG via POE; contact Neuro Epilepsy ICU fellow for
   EEG interpretation and formal consult.  If sz activity is identified,
   we advocate aggressive seizure control with benzodiazepines and
   antiepileptic medications which will be guided by the Neurology
   consultants.
   4. Avoid hyperglycemia
   5.  Once rewarmed, would aim for normothermia, as some patients may
   spike fevers post-hypothermia, and hyperthermia is clearly associated
   with poorer outcomes in neuro patients; the Arctic Sun pads can be used
   to facilitate normothermia as well if needed
   Will continue to follow along, please call/page 24/7 with any questions

   Imaging: CXR: Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.9 cm
   from the carina. Nasogastric tube tip terminates within the stomach.
   There are low inspiratory lung volumes. The heart size appears mildly
   enlarged. Patchy opacities are noted within the perihilar regions as
   well as in the retrocardiac regions, which are nonspecific and may
   relate to pulmonary edema or infection. There is no pleural effusion or
   pneumothorax.  Mediastinum is apparently widened, but again this may be
   secondary to supine positioning and low inspiratory volumes.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Satisfactory placement of endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube.
   2. Patchy ill-defined opacities within the perihilar regions and left
   retrocardiac region, which may be due to pulmonary edema or infection.
   ECG: NSR, 88 bpm, no ST elevations and Q waves in III and aVF.
   Assessment and Plan
   66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
   .
   * Cardiac Arrest:  Differential diagnosis for sudden arrest includes
   MI, massive PE, cardiac tampenade, arrhythmia, metabolic derrangement,
   toxicosis.  Given ST elevations in inferior distribution on EKGs by EMS
   and elevated CKMB, MI causing V fib arrest seems most likely etiology.
   PE causing PEA arrest and subsequent hypoperfusion leading to V fib
   aslo a possibility, but lack of right heart strain on echo does not
   support this.
   -- Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin, and heparin gtt
   -- obtain am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   -- follow cardiac biomarkers
   -- Formal Echo in am
   -- Initiate cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr, cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1580**])
      *start paralytics with Cisatracurium Besylate for shivering,
   continue fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   -- Chem 7, CBC, INR, tox screen - pending
   -- chest x ray
   -- will hold on obtaining CTA chest to r/o PE, given would not change
   current management
   -- obtain arterial line for BP monitoring - done in ED
   -- will consider central venous line if hemodynamically unstable
   -- Will consider catheterization if neurologically improves
   .
   * Status post intubation for respiratory protection:  Initially
   intubated for airway protection.  Found to have unclear opacities on
   CXR which may be blood, sputum, or edema.
   -- ventalation weaned to FiO2 50%, will recheck ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   -- fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
   -- continue antibiotics with unasyn for aspiration coverage, consider
   stopping vanc
   -- Q 6 mouth care
   .
   * Hypertension: Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250.
   Has known hypertension, per wife but not on any antihypertensive
   medications at home.  Unusual to have hypertension in the setting of
   MI, but may have increased catecholamines after resucitation.
   -- continue nitro gtt as needed
   -- 5 mg IV lopressor Q 6 Hr
   -- will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under
   better control and taking POs
   .
   * Neurologic unresponsiveness:  Found to have decorticate posturing at
   OSH.  Did not have pupillary or gag reflexes in ED.
   -- continue cooling protocol with 48 hr EEG
   -- f/u with neurology
   -- continue sedation and paralysis
   .
   * UTI: moderate bacteria seen on UA
   -- f/u culture
   -- continue unasyn as above
   .
   * FEN/GI:  Has OG tube in place but will be NPO while on paralytics
   -- famotidine IV Q 12

   Chief Complaint:
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 YOM with no past medical history who has not sought
   medical care, who was in his usual state of health until this evening
   when he had an unwitnessed arrest.  He was last heard walking down the
   stairs to do some work in the basement and about 5 minutes later, his
   wife heard moaning but no fall or crash and found him lying on floor
   unresponsive.  She called 911 and called her son and friend who
   provided CPR until the police arrived and placed an AED on the patient
   (who may have been pulseless at that time).  The AED detected a
   shockable rhythm and fired two shocks.  Estimated time from arrest to
   shock was 10 minutes.  EMS arrived and found that the patient had a
   pulse and stable vital signs but he was breathing shallow breaths on
   his own.  An initial EKG showed ST elevations in the inferior leads,
   most prominent in III and depressions in V1 through V6.  The patient
   was taken to [**Hospital3 1618**] and received 100 mg lidocane in transport.
   At [**Hospital1 **] he was still unresponsive and had posturing.  He was intubated
   for airway protection.  There were no ST elevations seen on EKG at that
   time, but there were depressions in V1 and V2 and evolving Q waves in
   III and AVf.  He had a positive CKMB of 8.  He underwent head and neck
   CT which were negative.  He was given dilantin and ativan.  He was then
   med-flighted to [**Hospital1 5**].
   .
   Upon arrival to the ED he was hemodynamically stable with T 98.4 HR 99
   and BP 117/70 100% O2sat intubated with fio2 100%.  He was intubated
   with peak 14, peep 5, on 100% fio2, and sedated on benzodiazepines
   without pain medication.  His EKG showed NSR, 88 bpm, no ST elevations
   and Q waves in III and aVF.  He had a bedside echo, which showed
   hypokinesis of the mid and basal inferioseptal and inferolateral walls
   with EF 45%.  Cardiology did not feel that he needed an urgent cath
   given the resolution of ST elevations and he was started on a heparin
   gtt and given aspirin and plavix 300 mg.   Blood pressure was found to
   be elevated at 202/105.  Neurological exam revealed cortical posturing
   and lack of gag and pupilary reflexes.
   .
   ROS unable to be obtained due to unresponsiveness/ sedation/
   intubation. But by report from his wife he has been feeling fatigued
   today.  Also has had ? left sided chest pain and shortness of breath
   with exertion for a while, but never had it checked out.  Denied
   knowledge of fever, chills, HA.

   Imaging: CXR: Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.9 cm
   from the carina. Nasogastric tube tip terminates within the stomach.
   There are low inspiratory lung volumes. The heart size appears mildly
   enlarged. Patchy opacities are noted within the perihilar regions as
   well as in the retrocardiac regions, which are nonspecific and may
   relate to pulmonary edema or infection. There is no pleural effusion or
   pneumothorax.  Mediastinum is apparently widened, but again this may be
   secondary to supine positioning and low inspiratory volumes.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Satisfactory placement of endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube.
   2. Patchy ill-defined opacities within the perihilar regions and left
   retrocardiac region, which may be due to pulmonary edema or infection.
   ECG: NSR, 88 bpm, no ST elevations and Q waves in III and aVF.
   Assessment and Plan
   66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
   .
   * Cardiac Arrest:  Differential diagnosis for sudden arrest includes
   MI, massive PE, cardiac tampenade, arrhythmia, metabolic derrangement,
   toxicosis.  Given ST elevations in inferior distribution on EKGs by EMS
   and elevated CKMB, MI causing V fib arrest seems most likely etiology.
   PE causing PEA arrest and subsequent hypoperfusion leading to V fib
   aslo a possibility, but lack of right heart strain on echo does not
   support this.
   -- Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin, and heparin gtt
   -- obtain am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   -- follow cardiac biomarkers
   -- Formal Echo in am
   -- Initiate cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr, cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1580**])
      *start paralytics with Cisatracurium Besylate for shivering,
   continue fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   -- Chem 7, CBC, INR, tox screen - pending
   -- chest x ray
   -- will hold on obtaining CTA chest to r/o PE, given would not change
   current management
   -- obtain arterial line for BP monitoring - done in ED
   -- will consider central venous line if hemodynamically unstable
   -- Will consider catheterization if neurologically improves
   .
   * Status post intubation for respiratory protection:  Initially
   intubated for airway protection.  Found to have unclear opacities on
   CXR which may be blood, sputum, or edema.
   -- ventalation weaned to FiO2 50%, will recheck ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   -- fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
   -- continue antibiotics with unasyn and vanc for aspiration coverage
   -- Q 6 mouth care
   .
   * Hypertension: Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250.
   Has known hypertension, per wife but not on any antihypertensive
   medications at home.  Unusual to have hypertension in the setting of
   MI, but may have increased catecholamines after resucitation.
   -- continue nitro gtt as needed
   -- 5 mg IV lopressor Q 6 Hr
   -- will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under
   better control and taking POs
   .
   * Neurologic unresponsiveness:  Found to have decorticate posturing at
   OSH.  Did not have pupillary or gag reflexes in ED.
   -- continue cooling protocol with 48 hr EEG
   -- f/u with neurology
   -- continue sedation and paralysis
   .
   * UTI: moderate bacteria seen on UA
   -- f/u culture
   -- continue unasyn as above

 AP CHEST 9:40 P.M. ON [**5-30**]

 HISTORY:  Cardiac arrest, requiring defibrillation.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 1:14 a.m.:

 Endotracheal tube is in standard placement.  Transesophageal probe ends in the
 upper stomach and a nasogastric tube passes beyond the mid stomach and out of
 view.  Lung volumes have improved, moderate cardiomegaly has not.  Right
 perihilar haze is probably edema.  Left infrahilar consolidation is probably
 atelectasis but pneumonia is not excluded in either location.  No
 pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fracture.

   walking down the stairs to do some work in the basement and about 5
   minutes later, his wife heard moaning but no fall or crash and found
   him lying on floor unresponsive.  She called 911 and called her son and
   friend who provided CPR until the police arrived and placed an AED on
   the patient (who may have been pulseless at that time).  The AED
   detected a shockable rhythm and fired two shocks.  Estimated time from
   arrest to shock was 10 minutes.  EMS arrived and found that the patient
   had a pulse and stable vital signs but he was breathing shallow breaths
   on his own.  An initial EKG showed ST elevations in the inferior leads,
   most prominent in III and depressions in V1 through V6.  The patient
   was taken to [**Hospital3 1618**] and received 100 mg lidocane in transport.

   Imaging: CXR: Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.9 cm
   from the carina. Nasogastric tube tip terminates within the stomach.
   There are low inspiratory lung volumes. The heart size appears mildly
   enlarged. Patchy opacities are noted within the perihilar regions as
   well as in the retrocardiac regions, which are nonspecific and may
   relate to pulmonary edema or infection. There is no pleural effusion or
   pneumothorax.  Mediastinum is apparently widened, but again this may be
   secondary to supine positioning and low inspiratory volumes.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Satisfactory placement of endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube.
   2. Patchy ill-defined opacities within the perihilar regions and left
   retrocardiac region, which may be due to pulmonary edema or infection.
   ECG: NSR, 88 bpm, no ST elevations and Q waves in III and aVF.
   Assessment and Plan
   66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
   .
   * Cardiac Arrest:  Differential diagnosis for sudden arrest includes
   MI, massive PE, cardiac tampenade, arrhythmia, metabolic derrangement,
   toxicosis.  Given ST elevations in inferior distribution on EKGs by EMS
   and elevated CKMB, MI causing V fib arrest seems most likely etiology.
   PE causing PEA arrest and subsequent hypoperfusion leading to V fib
   aslo a possibility, but lack of right heart strain on echo does not
   support this.
   -- Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin, and heparin gtt
   -- obtain am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   -- follow cardiac biomarkers
   -- Formal Echo in am
   -- Initiate cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr, cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1580**])
      *start paralytics with Cisatracurium Besylate for shivering,
   continue fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   -- Chem 7, CBC, INR, tox screen - pending
   -- chest x ray
   -- will hold on obtaining CTA chest to r/o PE, given would not change
   current management
   -- obtain arterial line for BP monitoring - done in ED
   -- will consider central venous line if hemodynamically unstable
   -- Will consider catheterization if neurologically improves
   .
   * Status post intubation for respiratory protection:  Initially
   intubated for airway protection.  Found to have unclear opacities on
   CXR which may be blood, sputum, or edema.
   -- ventalation weaned to FiO2 50%, will recheck ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   -- fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
   -- continue antibiotics with unasyn for aspiration coverage, consider
   stopping vanc
   -- Q 6 mouth care
   .
   * Hypertension: Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250.
   Has known hypertension, per wife but not on any antihypertensive
   medications at home.  Unusual to have hypertension in the setting of
   MI, but may have increased catecholamines after resucitation.
   -- continue nitro gtt as needed
   -- 5 mg IV lopressor Q 6 Hr
   -- will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under
   better control and taking POs
   .
   * Neurologic unresponsiveness:  Found to have decorticate posturing at
   OSH.  Did not have pupillary or gag reflexes in ED.
   -- continue cooling protocol with 48 hr EEG
   -- f/u with neurology
   -- continue sedation and paralysis

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Unwittnessed cardiac arrest but patient observed minutes before and
   mayhave had pulse when first found; History suggests rapid response and
   defibrillation; Initial ECG showed inferior ST elevation with
   subsequent resolution; No prior history.
   Physical Examination
   sedated and pharmacologic paralysis;
   JVP flat;
   Lungs: clear
   Heart: Regular rhythm; No murmur or gallop;
   Medical Decision Making
   Ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest now on cooling protocol;
   cardiac cath considered but given no emergent indication (active
   ischemia, hemodynamic instability) will follow for evidence of
   neurologic recovery;
   Critical care 45 minutes due to severity of illness, assessment  and
   monitoring.

   not sought medical care, who was in his usual state of health until
   this evening when he had an unwitnessed arrest.  He was last heard
   walking down the stairs to do some work in the basement and about 5
   minutes later, his wife heard moaning but no fall or crash and found
   him lying on floor unresponsive.  She called 911 and called her son and
   friend who provided CPR until the police arrived and placed an AED on
   the patient (who may have been pulseless at that time).  The AED
   detected a shockable rhythm and fired two shocks.  Estimated time from
   arrest to shock was 10 minutes.  EMS arrived and found that the patient
   had a pulse and stable vital signs but he was breathing shallow breaths
   on his own.  An initial EKG showed ST elevations in the inferior leads,
   most prominent in III and depressions in V1 through V6.  The patient
   was taken to [**Hospital3 1618**] and received 100 mg lidocane in transport.
   At [**Hospital1 **] he was still unresponsive and had posturing.  He was intubated
   for airway protection.  There were no ST elevations seen on EKG at that
   time, but there were depressions in V1 and V2 and evolving Q waves in
   III and AVf.  He had a positive CKMB of 8.  He underwent head and neck
   CT which were negative.  He was given dilantin and ativan.  He was then

   while out walking with sister (witnessed). By report, CPR was initiated
   by EMS s/p shock and was tx with atropine , epinephrine. Question of
   downtime prior to CPR.  In ER, pt had pulse then arrested( PEA /VF
   arrest) for which he received another defib/shock, more CPR and
   Epi/Atropine as well as Heparin bolus to r/o ACS, ASA and Amiodorone
   bolus 300 mg as well as Dopa gtt.
   In cath lab, no new occlusions were found- only chronic occlusion of
   RCA/LAD so no intervention was done at that time. Pt had
multiple VF
   arrests
 in lab again with hyperkalemia and increased creatinine noted.
   Pt was treated for hyperkalemia with insulin/D50/kexilate and
   ventilator was adjusted to accommodate for acidosis. Pt was also
   started on Amiodorone gtt 1 mg, levo gtt, epi gtt- as well as bolused
   with atropine, CaCl, HCO3. Travenous wire and IABP were
   inserted/placed. On arrival to CCU cont to have VT without a pulse
   requiring CPR and shocks, multiple rounds of meds, finally went into
   NSR.

"916",1902,61282,"Chief Complaint:  Cardiac arrest
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6050**] is a 62 yo man with h/o CAD s/p early MI, hypertension,
   hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, smoking who [**Last Name (un) **] at 11:45 he was
   walking with his sisters after getting a cup of coffe and he collapsed
   on his face approximately at 11:50 (wife spoke with patient at 11:45 on
   cell phone).  911 was called; per the family approximately 5-10 minutes
   elapsed prior to the arrival of 1st responders and initiation of CPR.
   EMS arrived shortly thereafter and he was found to be in VT.  First EMS
   strip is 11:54 and appears to be sinus bradycardia with very wide QRS
   and PR.  Subsequent strips by EMS show VT at 12:01, 12:04, 12:05,
   12:06.  Multiple VT morphologies and cycle lengths.  He was shocked 4
   times; ""post shock"" rythm shows resoration of sinus rhythma with very
   prolonged intervals.  There are numerous rhythm strips showing VT at
   variable cycle lengths and morphologies.  He also received 3mg epi, 2mg
   atropine, and lidocaine.
   .
   Upon further history taking, he was in his usual state of health until
   a few days ago when he began complaining of feeling generally unwell.
   As per wife, no specific complaints of chest pain, palpitations,
   dyspnea.  Speaking with his primary care doctor Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6051**] Mr.
   [**Known lastname 6050**] had not seen [**Name8 (MD) **] MD in over 1 year.  He was seen mid-[**Month (only) 1530**]
   where his Hgb A1c was found to be 10, his Cr 2.4, and K 5.9 on
   lisinopril 5mg po daily.  His hyperkalemia was managed by holding his
   ACE inhibitor.  He was seen in clinic on [**4-25**] and he was started on
   lisinopril 10mg po daily + lasix 40mg po daily without repeating a
   potassium measurement.
   .
   At [**Hospital1 5**] ED he was found to be in VT again, received 2 shocks and 300mg
   amiodarone bolus, heparin bolus, 1mg epi x 2, 1mg atropine, aspirin,
   versed, and dopamine drip.  In the cath lab he was found to have what
   appeared to be chronic occlusions of his LAD and RCA.  He had no PCI
   but did have an IABP placed.  In the cath lab he had inumerable
   episodes of VT and was probably shocked 30 times.  He received 2g
   calcium chloride, 4mg atropine, amiodarone 1mg drip, epinephrine 4mg
   bolus and epinephrine 3mcg/min bolus, levophed drip at 1mg/min,
   lidocaine 200mg bolus, 2g magnesium, 150mEq bicarbonate, 2mg versed,
   insulin + bicarbonate.  Peri-code it was discovered that his K was 6.9;
   the VT appeared to respond most favorably to insulin/dextrose &
   bicarbonate.  Upon arriving to the CCU he immediately went into VT
   again and was coded for about 15 minutes with numerous shocks, several
   rounds of epi/atropine, amio bolus.  He returned to NSR.
   .
   Around 5pm he was noted to have rhythmic tongue twitching.  slightly
   decreased with ativan.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 6047**] is a 62 yo man with CAD, CKD, DM who presents with
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest. [**Month (only) 8**] be a primary arrhythmic event versus related to
   ischemia vs post-ischemic cardiomyopathy.  More likely however seems to
   be VT from metabolic derangement/hyperkalemia given the numerous
   morphologies of his VT from the EMS & the wide intervals of his sinus
   rhythm EKG.  Unfortunately he has very poor neurologic prognosis given
   - no cooling given his instability unless becomes febrile
   - neuro consult
   - q 4 hour neuro checks
   .
   # Refractory ventricular tachycardia: may be secondary to either
   hyperkalemia or ischemia.
   - q 4 hours K+ and ABG
   - continue lidocaine drip at 2
   - continue amiodarone drip at 1mg/min
   - echo in AM to eval for WMA/ischemia
   - ACLS & amio if recurrs
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: may be related to VT versus ischemia
   - wean EPI, then levophed, then dopamine
   - IABP.  Re-evaluate need for baloon in AM.
   - Echo in AM
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: LAD and RCA occlusions appeared to be old
   - consider viability study/MIBI and revascularization if survives.
   - aspirin, statin
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: unclear if this is primary from ARF & ACE versus
   secondary to acidosis
   - monitor K q 4 hours.
   - insulin drip
   - s/p kayexalate
   .
   # Mental status: has signs of severe CNS injury with bleak prognosis
   (decerebrate posturing; babinski, dilated pupils, oculocephalics not
   intact); likely anoxic brain injury.  Given h/o fall on head and
   anticoagulation (heparin & aspirin) in the lab, CNS bleed should be
   ruled out.
   - CT head if stabilized in AM
   - EEG in AM
   - propofol for sedation, will try to avoid sedation to monitor neuro
   status.
   .
   # Tongue twitching: neurology c/s feels this is likely myoclonus.
   Seizure also on ddx
   - EEG in AM
   .
   # Acute renal failure: likely due to ACE & lasix.  [**Month (only) 8**] develop ATN
   post-code.  Still urinating
   - monitor I/O
   - appreciate renal recs
   - hold nephrotoxins

  1.  Complete collapse of the left lower lobe and partial collapse of the right
  lower lobe, likely secondary to secretions.  Small bilateral pleural
  effusions.

  2.  Diffuse stranding around the body and tail of the pancreas which is
  concerning for pancreatitis.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  If there

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CT OF THE CHEST, [**2160-5-7**].

 HISTORY:  62-year-old man with bradycardia/V-fib arrest on day prior status
 post code, now vented with hypoxia.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 FINDINGS:  Contiguous helical acquisition through the chest was performed.
 1.5- and 5-mm axially and 5-mm sagittally and coronally reformatted images
 were created.

 FINDINGS:  The heart is top normal in size with left ventricular enlargement.
 There is calcification within the coronary arteries and aorta.  There is no
 mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  There is a central venous catheter from
 an inferior approach terminating in the main pulmonary artery, likely
 representing a Swan-Ganz catheter.  An ET tube is in place terminating in
 standard position.  An NG tube terminates within the proximal stomach.  No
 pericardial effusion is identified.

 There is mild emphysema.  The central airways are patent.  There is complete
 collapse of the left lower lobe and partial collapse/atelectasis of the right
 lower lobe.  There is mild emphysema in the lungs.  There are small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  No pulmonary vascular congestion or nodules are
                                                             (Over)

 identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are acute fractures of the
 first, third, fourth, and fifth ribs anteriorly and a possible fracture of the
 ninth rib posteriorly which is attributed to CPR.

 Although the study was not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, bilateral
 low-density lesions within the visualized kidneys are identified, likely
 representing cysts.  There is diffuse stranding noted around the pancreatic
 body and tail.  The pancreatic head is not visualized.  The visualized liver
 and spleen are unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Complete collapse of the left lower lobe and partial collapse of the right
 lower lobe, likely secondary to secretions.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions.

 2.  Diffuse stranding around the body and tail of the pancreas which is
 concerning for pancreatitis.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  If there
 is clinical concern for pancreatitis, a CT of the abdomen may be obtained for
 further characterization.

 3.  Bilateral indeterminate low-density lesions within the kidneys bilaterally
 which statistically most likely represent renal cysts.  An ultrasound may be
 obtained for further characterization.

 4.  Multiple right-sided rib fractures involving ribs one through five
 anteriorly and possible fracture of rib nine posteriorly which are attributed
 to recent CPR.

 These findings were communicated to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2160-5-7**] at 3:00 p.m.

   62 yo man suffered cardiac arrest today.  Apparently with prior history
   of CAD and family history of premature CAD.  Uncertain time from
   collapse to CPR
 arrived in [**Hospital1 5**] ED apparently receiving CPR.  One
   reported downtime ~ 20 minutes
 but was receiving CPR for at least
   some of that time.  Urgently cathed with showed apparently chronically
   occluded RCA and LAD.  I have personally reviewed the cath films and
   discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4235**].  There is no indication for acute
   intervention in cath lab or surgically at this time.
   The patient has suffered from recurrent ventricular arrhythmias
   requiring multiple shocks.  He is being maintained on an IABP and
   multiple pressors.  Currently his oxygen saturation on 100% FiO2 is
   94-95%, BP is 128/80 on IABP, lungs are ronchorous with decreased air
   movement, cardiac exam is RRR (tachy) with s1s2 II/VI SEM, abd is soft
   with masses or apparent tenderness, ext no C/C/E.  The pt is intubated
   and was moving prior to sedation.
   ECG shows ST with LBBB (earlier) now LBBB appears resolved (on
   telelmetry).
   Impression: Infarct related cardiomyopathy s/p cardiac arrest.  Given
   hemodynamic and arrhythmia instability, he is not a good candidate for
   cooling at this time.  He is receiving Amiodarone and lidocaine
   intravenously as well as pressor support.  We will attempt to correct
   metabolic derangements.  We have consulted the renal service for
   assistance.
   I have reviewed his status in detail with the patient
s family
   including his wife and son.  They are aware that he is critically ill
   with a poor prognosis.  I have also reviewed his case in detail with
   the CCU team.  Total time spent on patient critical care 120 minutes.
   ICU level care due to recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, IABP, and
   intubation.

 STUDY:  CT head without contrast.

 INDICATION:  Cardiac arrest, altered mental status.

 COMPARISON:  None available.

 FINDINGS:  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass lesion, shift of
 midline structures, hydrocephalus or acute major territorial infarct.  The
 normal [**Doctor Last Name 34**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.  The major intracranial
 cisterns are preserved.

 Diffuse sinus opacification is demonstrated involving the maxillary, ethmoid
 and sphenoid sinuses.  The mastoid air cells are clear.  Dense calcified
 atheromatous plaque within the carotid siphons bilaterally.

 The orbital regions and extracalvarial soft tissues are unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or major territorial infarct
 is apparent.  Of note, MRI with diffusion-weighted sequences are more
 sensitive for evaluation of acute ischemia.

 2.  Extensive sinus disease.

 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of a patient with cardiac arrest.

 No prior studies are available for comparison.

 The ET tube tip is  at the origin of the right main bronchus and should be
 pulled back for 4 cm.  The intra-aortic balloon pump tip is at the distance of
 6.5 cm from the top of the ascending aorta.  The Swan-Ganz catheter inserted
 through the right femoral approach is at the level of main pulmonary artery.
 Cardiomegaly is noted.  The mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable.
 Questionable nodule is seen in the right upper lung that also might represent
 summation of shadows and should be reevaluated on the subsequent studies. Mild
 pulmonary edema is present.

 The ET tube position was discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3574**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 48254**] over the phone by
 Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 115**] at approximately at 4:50 p.m. on [**2160-5-6**].

"924",1902,61282,"This is a 62 yr old pt with Hx MI, DM, CAD who collapsed/had CV arrest
   while out walking with sister (witnessed). By report, CPR was initiated
   by EMS after AED advised shock and he was tx with atropine ,
   epinephrine. There is a question as to how long pt was down without
   CPR  or with
 inadequate circulation
  PTA to ER- ? 20-25 minutes by
   one report. On arrival to ER, pt had pulse then arrested( PEA /VF
   arrest) for which he received another defib/shock, more CPR and
   Epi/Atropine as well as Heparin bolus to r/o ACS, ASA and Amiodorone
   bolus 300 mg as well as Dopa gtt.
   In cath lab, no new occlusions were found- only chronic occlusion of
   RCA/LAD so no intervention was done at that time. Pt had
multiple VF
   arrests
 in lab again with hyperkalemia and increased creatinine noted.
   Pt was treated for hyperkalemia with insulin/D50/kexilate and
   ventilator was adjusted to accommodate for acidosis. Pt was also
   started on Amiodorone gtt 1 mg, levo gtt, epi gtt- as well as bolused
   with atropine, CaCl, HCO3. Travenous wire and IABP were
   inserted/placed.
   Upon arrival to CCU pt coded again- defib/shocked several times,
   rebolused with Amiodorone and Lido and HCO3 and started on 2mg  Lido
   gtt as well as insulin gtt for hyperglycemia.
   By early evenings, able to wean off EPI gtt, wean down Levo gtt as MAPS
   stayed -68-74.(remaining on same 15 mcg/kg Dopa gtt). The  Amiodorone
   was kept at 1mg, Lido kept at 2mg with stable heart rhythym. His
   Heparin gtt was d/c as were his sedations meds for better monitoring of
   neuro status. Pupils remains nonreactive, MAE very minimally, posturing
   and reflexive movements only.
   Neuro and Renal both consulted on the pt- [**Name (NI) 6043**] [**Name (NI) **] was deferred d/t
   unstable  hemodynamic situation with the pt. He remains attached to TV
   wire on standby and to Defib/Lifepack.
   Plan is for pt to stabilize overnite and go for head CT/start EEG
   monitoring in AM.
   Family has met with/spoken with  Social work, CCU team-RN and MD, Neuro
   Team re: overall prognosis, situation and have stayed overnite ( wife,
   daughter, son, 2 sisters).
   Hyperkalemia (high Potassium, Hyperpotassemia)
   Assessment:
   Pt admitted s/p CV arrest in setting of hyperkalemia currently
   correcting to 5.2-4.3
   Action:
   Given one dose Kexilate 30gm. Remains on insulin gtt 10u-6u per BS.
   Checking K q 2 hours until overnite- dropping lab check to q 4 hour d/t
   stabilization of lab.
   Response:
   Pt correcting K level to 4.3-4.7.
   Plan:
   Continue to check k level q 4 hour and watch trend.
   Altered mental status (not Delirium)
   Assessment:
   Pt s/p CV arrest perhaps anoxic injury arrived and remains
   nonresponsive to verbal command.
   Action:
   Neuro checks q 1 hour. Neuro consult this shift. D/C heparin gtt- to
   check re: d/c ASA in case of bleed s/p witnessed fall in field. D/C
   sedation at 7:30 pm to better assess neuro status. Initiated [**Location (un) 408**] J
   collar s/p fall as well for neck protection. Using log roll with
   moving, providing collar care. Keeping temperature normal
 Tylenol q 6
   hours prn initiated.
   Response:
    Within 2 hours of d/c sedation, pt moving slightly more but reflex
   movements only- moving tongue, jaw; moving right and left arm and very
   slightly the rt and left legs- appearing to be more posturing  in
   nature. Please refer to extensive neurological flow sheet for details.
   No seizure felt to be occurring per neuro consult.
   Plan:
   Hold kepra per neuro as movements of tongue/mouth not thought to be
   seizure in nature but myoclonic. Once pt
s hemodynamics more
   stabilized, off Levo gtt and overall less unstable- plan to send for
   head CT and start EEG monitoring. Discuss with neuro ? need to d/c ASA
   as well as heparin pending CT scan to r/o bleed/other processes. Keep
   temp normal to decrease metabolic requirements of brain/heart. Tylenol
   for low grade temp and cooling blkt as needed. Add back Propofol gtt
   for sedation if pt requires it instead of versed/Fentanyl to provide
   for easier neuro exams.
   Ventricular fibrillation (VF)
   Assessment:
   Pt admitted to CCU s/p VF arrest possibly d/t hyperkalemia.
   Action:
   Pt remains on amiodorone 1 mg and lido 2mg gtt. Pacer on standby (
   transvenous)-not currently being used. Defib in place and on standby as
   well.
   Response:
   Pt remains free of arrythmias this shift. No pacing as well. (+)
   sensing and pacing( tested) . VVI pacer set at 60 for rate and 10 mA.
   Plan:
   Continue amio/lido gtt. Keep lytes WNL. Continue to have defib in
   place, on standby.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 6047**] is a 62 yo man with CAD, CKD, DM who presents with
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest. [**Month (only) 8**] be a primary arrhythmic event versus related to
   ischemia vs post-ischemic cardiomyopathy.  More likely however seems to
   be VT from metabolic derangement/hyperkalemia given the numerous
   morphologies of his VT from the EMS & the wide intervals of his sinus
   rhythm EKG.  Unfortunately he has very poor neurologic prognosis given
   - no cooling given his instability unless becomes febrile
   - neuro consult
   - q 4 hour neuro checks
   .
   # Refractory ventricular tachycardia: may be secondary to either
   hyperkalemia or ischemia.
   - q 4 hours K+ and ABG
   - continue lidocaine drip at 2
   - continue amiodarone drip at 1mg/min
   - echo in AM to eval for WMA/ischemia
   - ACLS & amio if recurrs
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: may be related to VT versus ischemia
   - wean EPI, then levophed, then dopamine
   - IABP.  Re-evaluate need for baloon in AM.
   - Echo in AM
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: LAD and RCA occlusions appeared to be old
   - consider viability study/MIBI and revascularization if survives.
   - aspirin, statin
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: unclear if this is primary from ARF & ACE versus
   secondary to acidosis
   - monitor K q 4 hours.
   - insulin drip
   - s/p kayexalate
   .
   # Mental status: has signs of severe CNS injury with bleak prognosis
   (decerebrate posturing; babinski, dilated pupils, oculocephalics not
   intact); likely anoxic brain injury.  Given h/o fall on head and
   anticoagulation (heparin & aspirin) in the lab, CNS bleed should be
   ruled out.
   - CT head if stabilized in AM
   - EEG in AM
   - propofol for sedation, will try to avoid sedation to monitor neuro
   status.
   .
   # Tongue twitching: neurology c/s feels this is likely myoclonus.
   Seizure also on ddx
   - EEG in AM
   .
   # Acute renal failure: likely due to ACE & lasix.  [**Month (only) 8**] develop ATN
   post-code.  Still urinating
   - monitor I/O
   - appreciate renal recs
   - hold nephrotoxins
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: statin
   .
   # Diabetes: insulin gtt
   .
   # PPX: heparin SQ, PPI

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiac arrest with subsequent intubation.

 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.

 FINDINGS:  Single bedside AP supine chest radiograph shows an endotracheal
 tube, with the tip positioned at the ostium of the right main stem bronchus.
 This tube should be retracted.  Otherwise, the study is notable for bilateral
 low lung volumes and enlarged cardiac silhouette.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  A retrocardiac pulmonary opacity is equivocal and
 should be evaluated with a PA and lateral chest radiograph when the patient is
 able to tolerate this.  The visualized soft tissue and osseous structures are
 unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube positioned at the right main stem bronchus,
 which should be retracted.

 Finding was discussed over the telephone by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 602**] with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 6047**] is a 62 yo man with CAD, CKD, DM who presents with
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest. [**Month (only) 8**] be a primary arrhythmic event versus related to
   ischemia vs post-ischemic cardiomyopathy.  More likely however seems to
   be VT from metabolic derangement/hyperkalemia given the numerous
   morphologies of his VT from the EMS & the wide intervals of his sinus
   rhythm EKG.  Unfortunately he has very poor neurologic prognosis given
   - no cooling given his instability unless becomes febrile
   - neuro consult
   - q 4 hour neuro checks
   .
   # Refractory ventricular tachycardia: may be secondary to either
   hyperkalemia or ischemia.
   - q 4 hours K+ and ABG
   - continue lidocaine drip at 2
   - continue amiodarone drip at 1mg/min
   - echo in AM to eval for WMA/ischemia
   - ACLS & amio if recurrs
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: may be related to VT versus ischemia
   - wean EPI, then levophed, then dopamine
   - IABP.  Re-evaluate need for baloon in AM.
   - Echo in AM
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: LAD and RCA occlusions appeared to be old
   - consider viability study/MIBI and revascularization if survives.
   - aspirin, statin
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: unclear if this is primary from ARF & ACE versus
   secondary to acidosis
   - monitor K q 4 hours.
   - insulin drip
   - s/p kayexalate
   .
   # Mental status: has signs of severe CNS injury with bleak prognosis
   (decerebrate posturing; babinski, dilated pupils, oculocephalics not
   intact); likely anoxic brain injury.  Given h/o fall on head and
   anticoagulation (heparin & aspirin) in the lab, CNS bleed should be
   ruled out.
   - CT head if stabilized in AM
   - EEG in AM
   - propofol for sedation, will try to avoid sedation to monitor neuro
   status.
   .
   # Tongue twitching: neurology c/s feels this is likely myoclonus.
   Seizure also on ddx
   - EEG in AM
   .
   # Acute renal failure: likely due to ACE & lasix.  [**Month (only) 8**] develop ATN
   post-code.  Still urinating
   - monitor I/O
   - appreciate renal recs
   - hold nephrotoxins
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: statin
   .
   # Diabetes: insulin gtt
   .
   # PPX: heparin SQ, PPI
   .
   # Code: full.  Family meeting planned in AM

   Pt came to EW [**9-29**] with palpitations and weakness and was found to be
   in rapid a-fib with RVR. She was cardioverted into NSR, but became
   bradycardic to the 30s and cyanotic and was intubated and started on
   dopamine. She was also started on IV amiodarone after bolus.[**9-30**] she
   went into juctional rhythm and amiodarone was d/c. [**10-4**] she was loaded
   with digoxin. [**10-5**] she went back into AF with rate in 70-90s and was
   tolerating it. She is presumed to have a community aquired PNA and is
   on levoquin. She was extubated at -09:30 [**10-6**] and was sating in low
   90s on 35% ventimask. She was still somnulent, but rouseable and will
   follow commands. She is on heparin at 2500 units/hr, heparin at 5
   mic/kilo and TPN at 42cc/hr. It is unclear why she is receiving TPN and
   not tube feedings. She is being transfered to be evaluated for valve
   replacement. She is full code.
   She arrived in CCU at 1745 with bp in 80s, minimally responsive,
   intermittently gurgling. She was in A-fib with HR in 1-teens to 130s
   with occasional PVCs. She was on heparin at 250 units/hr and 5mic/kilo
   dopamine. Dopamine was increased and then changed to levophed. It was
   decided to intubate her and then cardiovert her. She was fully
   cultured.
   Airway, Inability to Protect (Risk for Aspiration, Altered Gag, Airway
   Clearance, Cough)
   Assessment:
   Pt arrived solmnulent. She would rouse to stimulation by barely opening
   her eyes, but did not talk or follow any commands. Although sating 100%
   she seemed unable to protect her airway, particularly in setting of
   planned cardioversion.  Her gas on NRB was 7.46/40/306/5/29.
   Action:
   Anesthesia gave her 12mg etomidate and 110mg succinylcholine and easily
   intubated her.
   Response:
   She was put on ventilator at AC 400 X 16 with no overbreathing 5 PEEP
   and 100%. She was suctioned for thin froathy white sputum. VAP care
   done.
   Plan:
   CXR after OG tube placement. Continue with VAP care. Decrease FIO2 with
   gas.
   Atrial fibrillation (Afib)
   Assessment:
   Pt arrived in a-fib and hypotensive on dopamine and heparin.
   Action:
   Anesthesia was called and she was intubated and then cardioverted with
   200J. It was decided not to use amiodarone due to hx of junctional
   rhythm after this drug.
   Response:
   She went into NSR with rate initially in low 100s then down to mid 80s
   with both frequent PVCs and PACs.
   Plan:
   Monitor Rhythm and notify team with change.
   Hypotension (not Shock)
   Assessment:
   Pt arrived with bp in the 80s down to the 50s. BP was being taken on
   the left arm. She was on dopamine at 5mic/kilo in afib in 1-teens. BP
   was being taken on L side. After intubation bp dropped further to 60s
   and dopamine was changed to levophed at .09 mic/kilo. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5279**] spoke to
   OSH attending who said she had L subclavian stenosis and blood pressure
   could only be auscultated on the R.
   Action:
   BP auscultated on R and it ranged 130-140s/palp. Dinamap did not

 change.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the latest from [**2153-1-25**].

 ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST:

 The lungs show bilateral lower lobe opacities with multifocal mild
 interstitial opacities.  These are associated with moderate bilateral
 effusions.  The cardiac silhouette is normal.  The mediastinal silhouette is
 not widened.  A NG tube terminates with its tip in the stomach appropriately.
 A right internal jugular approach pacemaker lead terminates in the expected
 location of the right ventricle.  The ET tube terminates 5 cm above the carina
 appropriately.

 IMPRESSION:

 Lower lobe atelectasis with associated moderate effusions.  Mild interstitial
 edema.

   Patient seen and plan discussed with CCU housestaff.  For details, see
   CCU resident H&P.  Briefly, the patient is a 73 year old woman with PMH
   of COPD and recently diagnosed hyperthyroidism in the setting of new
   [**Hospital 13715**] transferred from [**Hospital3 364**] Hospital after arresting at home.
   The patient had recently been discharged from [**Hospital1 19**], and was seen
   earlier in the [**Hospital3 **] ED for a COPD exacerbation, which was treated
   and the patient was discharged home from the ED.  While at home, per
   reports, she became unconscious in front of her family, and had been
   down for several minutes before EMS arrived (unclear if CPR
   performed).  Per EMS reports, she was found to have a ventricular
   escape rhythm, and upon pacing had recovery of radial pulses, although
   soon after she lost her pressures, was intubated and taken to the [**Hospital **] ED.  She was found to have inferior ST elevations, and was taken
   emergently to the cath lab where she was found to have no obstructive
   CAD with a wedge of 36 mmHg and cardiac output of over 8 on neo and
   dopamine.  An IABP had been placed prior to the left heart cath, and
   was left in place for transfer.  Upon arrival, she was hypertensive
   with systolics in the 200s on pressors.  Neo and dopamine were
   discontinued.  She was noted to have purple toes in her right foot,
   with non-dopplerable pulses, and after d/c of heparin, the IABP was
   pulled with 50 minutes of pressure.  She had a triphasic popliteal
   pulse in the right leg, and a uniphasic PT pulse in her foot.  The
   color was beginning to improve in the foot after venostasis had been
   achieved, and so a pressure dressing was placed with plan to restart
   heparin and monitor clinically as well as CKs.  As far as her arrest,
   she will be instituted on the cooling protocol, and monitored for signs
   of neurological recovery.

   Chief Complaint:  s/p cardiac arrest requiring balloon pump for
   pressure support
   HPI:
   Ms [**Known lastname 13709**] is a 73 year-old female with pmh of dementia, newly
   diagnosed hyperthyroidism on methimizole, and atrial fibrillation s/p
   cardiac arrest being transferred from [**Hospital3 364**] Hospital due to
   hypotension requiring a balloon pump.
   She had presented to the [**Hospital3 **] ED the night prior to admission with
   shortness of breath and was treated with combivent and discharged
   home.  The night of admissison she collapsed in the presence of her
   family with a reported down time of about 5-10 minutes.  Her family
   called 911 (at 22:23) and CPR was initiated by the fire department
   while awaiting EMS.  An AED advised no shock as her initial rhythm
   showed a ventricular escape which was paced externally.  Reportedly she
   had pulses for about 10 minutes, then went asystolic while still in the
   field.  Chest compressions were started and she was intubated by EMS.
   She underwent 2 rounds of epi, atropine, and bicarb.  CPR continued
   into her arrival in the ED for another 15 minutes with more rounds of
   epi, atropine, and bicarb.  She eventually developed a sinus
   tachycardia with SBPs in the 80s on neo.
   EKG showed new ST elevations in her inferior leads.  She was loaded
   with 600 mg of plavix, given 325 mg of ASA.  She was also given 125 mg
   of solumedrol in the ED.  She was sent to the cath lab emergently.  She
   again lost a pulse with bradycardia to the 40s while being prepped on
   the cath lab table and underwent an additional round of CPR with epi,
   bicarb, and atropine.  Her HR increased with this treatment to the 90's
   and her pulse returned.
   Of note she was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 19**] from [**2-20**] to [**2-24**] when she
   presented with chest discomfort and was found to have new atrial
   fibrillation and hyperthyroidism.  At that hospitalization she was
   started on methimazole and propanolol for her hyperthyroidism and
   propanolol and aspirin for atrial fibrillation.  Her course was
   complicated by delirium on chronic dementia and psychiatry was
   consulted and made medication changes to her psych meds.
   On arrival to the CCU her SBP were in the 180's to 200's.  Her dopa and
   neo were turned off and she was given 10 mg IV labetalol for
   persistently elevated blood pressures.

   Assessment and Plan Ms [**Known lastname 13709**] is a 73 year-old female with dementia,
   newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism on methimizole, and atrial fibrillation
   s/p cardiac arrest being transferred from [**Hospital3 364**] Hospital due
   to hypotension requiring a balloon pump.
   # Hypotension:  The patient developed hypotension in the post arrest
   setting.  However she was hypertensive on arrival to the CCU.  Pressors
   were weaned and she was given 10 mg IV labetalol for persistently
   elevated SBPs in the 180's to 200;'s.  The IABP was removed.
   - Monitor pressures and add dopamine back if needed for MAP > 65.
   # S/p cardiac arrest:  The differential for cardiac arrest includes
   ischemic heart disease (unlikely given clean coronaries on cath),
   arrhythmia (bradycardias vs long QT syndrome vs idiopathic V.fib),
   valvular heart disease (she did have mitral regurgitation noted on her
   previous TTE), electrolyte abnormality, myocarditis, drug-induced,
   pulmonary embolism.  She is on quetiapine prn which can prolong the QT
   segment and trazadone which can be proarrhythmic.  Thyroid storm has
   been associated with cardiac arrest, however she had been on the
   methimazole so this is less likely.
   - Cooling with artic sun protocol as she was within the 6 hour time
   limit.
   - TTE to evaluate for change in valvular disease.
   - Neuro consult in the am
   - Continuous EEG per artic sun protocol
   - Pending clinical improvement, will need an ICD placed prior to
   discharge.
   - Will check TSH and free T4 as thyroid toxicosis is on the
   differential.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Head CT when stable
   # Pulseless right foot in the setting of IABP:  A known complication of
   IABP is distal limb ischemia.  Per report she had no had pulses in her
   right foot since IABP placement.  This is concerning for limb ischemia
   vs cholesterol emboli.
   - IABP was removed on arrival to the CCU.
   - Will trend CK's and clinically monitor with serial limb exams.
   - Heparin gtt
   - Consider angiography if her exam changes or CKs continue to rise.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient was found to have no occlusive coronary
   artery disease on cardiac catheterization.  Cholesterol had been
   checked in [**2-11**]: total cholesterol 134, LDL 55, HDL 61, and TG 88.
   # PUMP:  The patient had a recent TTE during her last admission which
   showed a normal EF of > 55%.  She currently appears euvolemic.
   - As above, TTE tomorrow to evaluate for change in valvular disease or
   heart function.
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation.    She
   had been started on propanolol for rate control during her last
   hospitalization.
   -  Holding propanolol due to hypotension.
   -  Continue ASA 325 mg daily.
   -  Monitor on telemetry
   # s/p intubation/History of asthma/COPD:  The patient was intubated in
   the setting of cardiac arrest and remains hypotensive, dependent on
   pressors and a balloon pump.
   - Continue ventilator support while being cooled.
   - Hold sedation to assess neurologic status.  Can restart fentanyl and
   versed if she appears uncomfortable.
   - Portable chest X-ray to confirm ETT placement.
   - Continue atrovent MDI qid.  As patient is intubated, will change
   advair to flovent 200 [**Hospital1 **].
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to shock liver from hypotension.
   - Trend LFTs.
   # Lactic acidosis:  Likely secondary to hypoperfusion due to recent
   hypotension.  BP support for MAPs > 65 as needed.
   - Trend lactate.
   #  Hyperthyroidism:
   -  Continue methimazole.
   -  Holding proranolol due to hypotension.
   -  Will check TSH and free T4.
   #  Anxiety/Dementia:  She is on mirtazapine, trazodone, and quetiapine
   -  Hold home medications while intubated.

   On arrival to the floor, the patient was continued on the Artic Sun
   cooling blanket, and fentanyl and versed were increased to keep patient
   from biting the ET tube. Approximately 20 mins after arrival, the
   patient became bradycardic and was found to be pulseless, a PEA code
   blue protocol was initiated. Chest compressions were started, cooling
   protocol was discontinued, and she received epinephrine x3, atropine
   x4, 2 amps bicarb, 1 amp calcium chloride, 1 amp glucagon, and an
   epinephrine gtt. She also received 1 amp D50 and 10 units regular
   insulin for hyperkalemia. After 15 mins of CPR, a pulse returned at 125
   and BP of 200/100. An EKG and CXR showing no pneumothorax were obtained
   and 10 mins later PEA returned. Again the epinephrine drip and CPR were
   resumed. She received atropine x1, calcium chloride x2. A dopamine gtt
   was started at 10mcg/kg/hr and an epinephrine gtt changed to rate of
   0.05 and a bicarb drip was started. At this time, her family was
   present and updated on the events of the night. The poor prognosis
   given the length of the code blue, and now significant hypoxia of 80%
   on 100% FiO2 after CPR were communicated. The family (pt's son and
   daughter) did not want ventilatory support withdrawn but agreed
   escalating care would not change the poor prognosis. Approximately 1
   hour later with the family at the bedside, the patient became
   bradycardic and hypotensive and died at 6:38 am.

   Imaging: [**10/2180**] TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Color-flow imaging of the
   interatrial septum raises the suspicion of an atrial septal
   defect, but this could not be confirmed on the basis of this
   study. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
   normal. There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis
   (LVEF = 30-35 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Moderate global left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction. Preserved right ventricular systolic function. Mild
   mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension. Possible
   small atrial septal defect.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo F with h/o idiopathic dialated cardiomyopathy, EF 35%, DM, HTN
   presents after being found down at home by family s/p PEA arrest in the
   field and concern for carvedilol overdose and now repeated PEA arrests.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Per EMS reports (strip not available) was found in complete
   heart block and transcutaneously paced in the field. She did received
   4mg IB glucagon. Wide complex tachycardia was noted on presentation to
   ED which resolved with bicarb drip. On arrival to the CCU, she quickly
   developed PEA arrest. CODE BLUE PROTOCL per PEA algorithm carried out
   with successful resumption of spontaneous circulation twice. After
   discussion with family goals of care given poor prognosis plan was for
   no further escalation of care. Patient expired at 6:38 am after
   becoming bradycardic/hypotensive with family at bedside. Awaiting
   family decision on autopsy, medical examiner declined case. PCP

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 08:32 P.M., [**3-7**]

 HISTORY:  Cardiac arrest, intubated.  Newly placed orogastric tube.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 01:53 p.m.:

 Mild pulmonary edema has improved, including the more seriously involve right
 upper lobe.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal vasculature is mildly
 engorged, but also decreased.  ET tube in standard placement.  Ascending
 Swan-Ganz catheter tip projects over the right pulmonary artery.  Left
 ventricular assist device is unchanged in position.  Orogastric tube can be
 traced only as far as the retrocardiac esophagus, but could go beyond that,
 though obscured by cardiac motion.  If it is necessary to localize this tube
 with certainty, repeat chest radiograph should be obtained, centered to
 include the upper stomach.

   Chief Complaint:  STEMI/Vfib arrest
   HPI:
   51 yo M with 3V CAD, previously stented to LAD at OSH in setting of MI,
   presents from [**Location (un) 196**] with CP, nausea and SOB similar (but worse) to
   prior MI. Initially EKG within normal limits, but was having ectopy,
   eventually EKG showed anterior ST elevations and he was given aspirin,
   heparin, plavix and IIb/IIIA, his BP dropped to the 100s he was given
   neosynpephrine.
   .
   Pt was then transfered to [**Hospital1 **] for catheterization. He was taken
   immediately to the cath lab, already in cardiogenic shock with BP
   dropping to 80s. Pt vomited but no clear aspiration noted. An IABP pump
   was placed. He was found to have an acute in-stent thrombosis of LAD,
   successfully cleared, chronically occluded RCA and 80% LCX. Pt
   developed VF arrest, CPR was initiated, he was shocked to brady rhythm
   for which he was given 3mg of atropine. Nadir ABG revealed 6.96/52/236,
   HCO3 13, Lactate 10. He was intubated and
   initially there was some small amounts of red frothy return from
   the ETT. IABP was replaced by Impella and required high doses of
   levophed and dopamine. Oxygenation worsened down to 70s and PEEP
   increased to 18 with improvement of O2 to 80s. Did not respond to
   increased tidal volumes to 750 and RR to 28, so pt paralyzed. After
   total of 400mg IV lasix and began improving oxygenation with urine
   output.  Pt started on amio with reduction of ectopy.

   Studies:
   CXR:
   Catheter projecting over the thoracic aorta, left ventricular outflow
   tract and cavity is probably a ventricular assist device. Ascending
   Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the right pulmonary artery. ET tube is
   approximately 3 cm above the carina and could not be advanced.
   Interstitial pulmonary edema is generally mild throughout the lungs,
   but there is greater opacification in the right upper lobe, which could
   be asymmetric edema (a finding seen with acute mitral regurgitation)
   or, alternatively concurrent pneumonia or aspiration or pulmonary
   hemorrhage. At the apex, small lucencies are probably due to emphysema,
   but should be considered in clinical context to exclude tuberculosis.
   Mediastinal widening is symmetric, from the carina to the thoracic
   inlet, probably due to combination of fat and mediastinal vascular
   engorgement but adenopathy is not excluded by this examination and if
   there is clinical concern for aortic dissection, I could explain the
   widening in the region of the aortic knob
   .
   EKG:
   ST elevations in Anterolateral leads I, AVL, V2-V5. . Inferior ST
   depressions. Lots of ventricular ectopy .
   .
   Emergency TTE:
   No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. LV systolic
   function appears depressed, but not severely so. A catheter is present
   in the left ventriculoar cavity. There is no ventricular septal defect.
   The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall
   hypokinesis. There is no pericardial effusion.
   .
   TEE:
   No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 % with
   relative preservation of the lateral, inferolateral and inferior
   walls). The distal tip of the Impella device appears to be in good
   position at approximately 5 centimeters from the aortic root. There is
   no ventricular septal defect. with moderate global free wall
   hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta
   to 40 centimeters from the incisors. No thoracic aortic dissection is
   seen. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion. The extent (if any) of aortic regurgitation
   cannot be characterized in the presence of an Impella device which
   crosses the aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   .
   IMPRESSION: Moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function
   with relative preservation of the lateral, inferolateral, and inferior
   walls. Severe right ventricular hypokinesis. Appropriate positioning of
   an Impella device in the left ventricle.

   CARDIAC CATH:
   Found to have occluded RCA and 80% LCX and Occluded LAD stent with
   thrombus, underwent PTCA and thrombectomy, restored slow flow with
   residual mild thrombus and no reflow despite adenosine.
   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo M with 3V CAD, s/p instent thrombosis of LAD, VF arrest.
   # CORONARIES: 3VD, s/p LAD in stent thrombosis. CEs prior to cath:
   CK258 MB17 MBI6.6 TropT0.07.
   - ASA, Plavix, statin
   - if except recovery, can discuss CABG given age and diffuse disease.
   - continue aggrastat for 6 hrs
   - consider heparin drip
   # PUMP:  EF ~30%. Impella, swan, aline in place.
   - Pressor support (Levophed and dopamine), avoiding dobutamine due to
   tachycardia/arrhythmia
   - Continue to uptitrate if necessary, with addition of vasopressin as
   next [**Doctor Last Name **].
   - monitor for volume given large volume diuresis, concern for
   hypotension, poor kidney perfusion.
   - IVF prn hypotension once forward flow improved.
   - ECHO Monday to assess effect of ischemia on function
   - consider Tandem heart if RV worsens
   - MV02 70%, CI 5 (3.5 of his own)
   - watching BP, tachycardia, UOP
   # RHYTHM: s/p V fib arrest, now loaded with Amio and Mg. Now sinus
   tachy, likely due to poor EF and acidosis.
   - Lidocaine gtt if break thought arrhythmias
   - consider BB for improved HR control and ectopy.
   - aggressive repletion of lytes
   # HYPOXIA: Improved, initially thought to be severe pulm edema due to
   cardiogenic shock. Differential also included superimposed [**Doctor Last Name 76**] from
   aspiration, possible pulmonary hemorrhage or contusion in the setting
   very elevated wedge and multiple anticoagulants. Complicated by morbid
   obesity.
   - Hold aggressive diuresis with lasix drip. Given initial euvolemia
   expect pt to become hypovolemic quickly and may require returned IVF
   given impella and pressors improving forward flow.
   - For continued desaturation, can consider recruitment with short
   course of increased PEEP.
   - Vent settings with tidal volumes 8cc/kg
   - frequent ABGs
   - f/u pulm recs, appreciate input
   #  ACIDOSIS: Predominantly due to lactate accumulation and poor
   ventilation. Improving with Impella and pressors.
   - continue frequent ABGs
   - paralysis to improve ventilation
   - bicarb prn
   # MYDRIASIS: Likely secondary to atropine/paralysis.
   -Once respiratory and hemodyanamic status stabilized would obtain head
   CT toevaluate for any evidence of hypoxic injury.
   #  LEUKOCYTOSIS: Likely stress reaction. No evidence of infection
   although high risk for aspiration.
   #  ACUTE RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: To be expected with arrest and poor
   forward flow. Also possible component of dye load (240ml omnipaque).
   - Monitor I/Os, IVF prn
   #  DIABETES:
   - insulin drip with goal BS <200
   #  HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Lipids pending
   #  WIDENED MEDIASTINUM: Given discrepancy of noninvasive BPs on arms
   concerning for dissection but reassured by congruent invasive BP
   measurements at femoral and aortic locations.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiac arrest.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain.  No
 intravenous contrast was administered.

 COMPARISON:  CT head [**2176-12-18**] and reference CT from an outside
 hospital uploaded in PACS.

 FINDINGS:  There is slight loss of [**Doctor Last Name 34**]-white matter differentiation.  There
 are bilateral subcortical hypodensities likely small vessel ischemic changes.
 There is a subtle hyperdense line in the right sylvian fissure, 2:18 and
 401B:62, cannot exclude a very subtle focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage;
 however, could also represent an artifact.  There is no shift of midline
 structures.  There is no hydrocephalus.  There is no intraventricular
 hemorrhage.  Ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration.  No
 fracture.  There is mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Question subtle loss of [**Doctor Last Name 34**]-white differentiation.
 2.  Small vessel ischemic changes.
 3.  Subtle hyperdense line in right sylvian fissure can be artifact, cannot
 exclude subtle focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage.

 NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is severe and uniform loss of grey white
 differentiation, and sulcal effacement. These findings are most compatible
 with global hypoperfusion and infarction.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  78-year-old man with cardiac arrest status post endotracheal tube
 placement.

 COMPARISONS:  None at this institution.

 FINDINGS:  A single supine portable radiograph was obtained.  The film is
 obscured by the presence of a trauma board and overlying monitoring devices.
 The lungs are hypoinflated.  Patchy opacity are seen at the right lung base
 and in the left upper lobe.  Widening of the cardiac silhouette and
 mediastinum is accentuated by low lung volumes.  The endotracheal tube
 terminates appropriate location.  Cardiac device is implanted in the right
 side of the chest with a single lead following the inferior margin of the
 heart.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Limited portable radiograph.
 2.  Bilateral consolidations.  Given context, contusions, aspirations, or
 confluent edema are primary diagnostic considerations.
 3.  Right-sided effusion.
 4.  Widened mediastinum, likely accentuated by technique and positioning.
 Baseline morphology unknown.

   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, patient is currently re-warming. TTE
   performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of the
   LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium.
   - Complete Artic sun protocol
   - Wean sedation as tolerates
   - CT head w/o contrast today per Neurology recs
   - EP will see today, likely ICD placement on this admission
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off dopamine
   .
   #. Pump - Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   .
   #. Coronaries - Pt with troponin T
s of 0.08 to 0.11 yesterday,
   secondary to arrrest. No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and
   negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation, now improved with gentle IVF
s & on
   Dopamine.
   - Infectious work up as below
   - IVF
   - Wean pressors as tolerated with target MAP >60
   .
   #. Leukocytosis
 Stable at 17.3 today from 18.0 on [**2131-12-29**]. Pt w/
   grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload, diarrhea at rehab
   though none here.  Cardiac arrest itself could also cause leukocytosis.
   - F/U Ucx
   - F/U BC
   - Levofloxacin given CXR and UA for 5 days
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic kidney disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5,
   admitted with Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone and dirty U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal
   etiology. Received gentle IVF
s on [**2131-12-29**] with good UOP. U/A grossly
   positive, receiving Levofloxacin, day 2. Cr improved to 2.5 this AM.
   - Hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   - Continue Levaquin 500mg IV q24H, day [**2-1**]
   .
   #. Anemia -Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2.
   - B12 & Folate pending
   - Can consider transfusion if mixed central venous O2 is low
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt s/p arrest now requiring pressors.
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   .
   #. Mitral regurgitation
 Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared
   to prior.
   .
   #. Asthma - No wheezes or signs of exacerbation. Will continue home
   medications.

   76F with CAD s/p CABG, recent NSTEMI and prolonged hospital course
   complicated by heart block requiring a pacemaker and PNA, ischemic
   cardiomyopathy (EF 35-40%) who presents after vfib arrest.  Per her
   nurse [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 714**] rehab, where she had been since her recent discharge,
   she was found slumped on the toilet at 9:30 p.m.  She did respond to
   caregivers and had a pulse at that time but lost it shortly
   thereafter.  The initial rhythm was noted to be vfib and she was
   shocked twice with return of spontaneous circulation.  By report,
   though not noted in the EMS paperwork, she again lost her pulse and was
   shocked an additional time and received a lidocaine bolus.  She was
   taken to an OSH where she was intubated and started on dopamine and
   transferred to the [**Hospital1 5**] ED.  A head CT in the ED showed no evidence of
   bleed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, patient is currently re-warming. TTE
   performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of the
   LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium.
   - Complete Artic sun protocol
   - Wean sedation as tolerates
   - CT head w/o contrast today per Neurology recs
   - ICD this admission
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off dopamine
   .
   #. Pump - Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   .
   #. Coronaries - Pt with troponin T
s of 0.08 to 0.11 yesterday,
   secondary to arrrest. No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and
   negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation, now improved with gentle IVF
s & on
   Dopamine.
   - Infectious work up as below
   - IVF
   - Wean pressors as tolerated with target MAP >60
   .
   #. Leukocytosis
 Stable at 17.3 today from 18.0 on [**2131-12-29**]. Pt w/
   grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload, diarrhea at rehab
   though none here.  Cardiac arrest itself could also cause leukocytosis.
   - F/U Ucx
   - F/U BC
   - Levofloxacin given CXR and UA for 5 days
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic kidney disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5,
   admitted with Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone and dirty U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal
   etiology. Received gentle IVF
s on [**2131-12-29**] with good UOP. U/A grossly
   positive, receiving Levofloxacin, day 2. Cr improved to 2.5 this AM.
   - Hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   - Continue Levaquin 500mg IV q24H, day [**2-1**]
   .
   #. Anemia -Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2.
   - B12 & Folate pending
   - Can consider transfusion if mixed central venous O2 is low
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt s/p arrest now requiring pressors.
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   .
   #. Mitral regurgitation
 Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared
   to prior.
   .
   #. Asthma - No wheezes or signs of exacerbation. Will continue home
   medications.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, patient is currently re-warming. TTE
   performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of the
   LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium.
   - Complete Artic sun protocol
   - Wean sedation as tolerates
   - CT head w/o contrast today per Neurology recs
   - ICD this admission
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off dopamine
   .
   #. Pump - Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   .
   #. Coronaries - Pt with troponin T
s of 0.08 to 0.11 yesterday,
   secondary to arrrest. No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and
   negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation. Patient also dehydrated given diarrhea.
   - Infectious work up as below
   - IVF
   - Wean pressors as tolerated with target MAP >60
   .
   #. Leukocytosis - Unclear etiology at this time. Pt has dirty UA, clean
   CXR, diarrhea at rehab. She is also after cardiac arrest, that itself
   could cause leukocytosis
   - UA & UC
   - BC
   - C diff
   - Trend WBC and fever
   - F/u micro
   - Levofloxacin given CXR and UA for 5 days
   .
   #. Anemia - MCV 96, MCH 30 and RDW 17.3; normocytic normochromic anemia
   with high RDW. Ferritin of 1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09
   suggesting iron deficiency. Folate and B12 not done at the time.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production.
   - B12
   - Folate
   - Reticulocyte count
   - LDH
   - Transfuse goal HCT >30 given CAD
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic kidney disease - Patient with diarrhea at home,
   poor PO intake on lisinopril and spironolactone, admitted with Cr 3.3.
   Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology. Received gentle IVF
s on
   [**2131-12-29**]
   - UA
   - F/u UOP
   - Hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   - Treat infection as above
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt s/p arrest now requiring pressors.
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   .
   #. Mitral regurgitation
 Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared
   to prior.
   .
   #. Asthma - No wheezes or signs of exacerbation. Will continue home
   medications.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  19-year-old female with history of intubation
 post-cardiac arrest.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.
 Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately the 3.3 cm above the
 level of the carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the
 diaphragm, distal aspect not included on the image.  Right perihilar opacity
 may relate to atelectasis or consolidation from aspiration, less likely
 infection.  The left lung is clear.  No large pleural effusion is seen,
 although a trace effusion may be difficult to exclude.  The cardiac silhouette
 is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  32-year-old male found down; question intracranial
 hemorrhage.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 FINDINGS:  There is no acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage or collection.
 The [**Doctor Last Name 34**]-white matter differentiation is poor, diffusely, which can be seen in
 global hypoxic-ischemic insult.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in size
 and configuration, and there is no mass effect.

 The orbits appear normal.  There is a large occipital scalp subgaleal
 hematoma, with a 1.5 x 10.8 cm fluid component.  There is mucosal thickening
 of the left maxillary sinus, and mottled contents are seen within the
 posterior nares and nasopharynx.  The ethmoid air cells, right maxillary
 sinus, and sphenoid sinuses are clear.  The mastoid air cells are clear
 bilaterally.  There is no fracture.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Poor [**Doctor Last Name 34**]-white differentiation, diffusely, which, in the setting of
 cardiac arrest, is very concerning for global hypoxic-ischemic injury.

 2.  No hemorrhage.

 3.  Large occipital scalp subgaleal hematoma, with diffuse edema in the
 extracranial soft tissues.

 NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: If warranted on clinical grounds, the diffuse
 cerebral process might be further characterized by MRI with DWI.

 COMPARISON:  [**2161-4-23**].

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH, PORTABLE VIEW:  A new right PICC line tip terminates in the
 right atrium.

 An endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5 cm above the carina.  A
 nasogastric tube tip is seen within the stomach.

 Again noted is an extensive consolidation and opacity involving the right
 middle lobe, without significant change from prior study(approximately two
 hours prior).  The cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  The left lung is
 clear.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  New right PICC line tip terminates in the right atrium.

 2.  Unchanged right middle lobe opacity likely represents atelectasis,
 aspiration or pneumonia.

 INDICATION:  33-year-old female, status post cardiac arrest, increasing
 hypoxia, intubated.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph available from [**2111-11-26**].

 SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:
 The cardiac silhouette is enlarged and increasingly obscured by hazy
 opacification of the hila with fluffy opacities extending to the bilateral
 lung peripheries, concerning for worsening cardiac failure. In addition, the
 left lung is much more opacified, there is a left retrocardiac opacity with
 air bronchograms, and the left border of the aorta is no longer seen. These
 findings are concerning for worsening pulmonary edema but also for a new large
 left-sided pneumonia.

 There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

 An endotracheal tube terminates 3.7 cm above the level of the carina.  There
 is an enteric tube terminating beyond the view of the study; however, a side
 port is located within the stomach.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. Worsing pulmonary edema with enlarged heart, concerning for severe failure.

 2. Significantly increased left opacity concerning for a large left-sided
 pneumonia.

"986",1991,72644,"Chief Complaint:  cardiac arrest
   HPI:
   33 yo female with history of depression/anxiety, alcoholism presented
   after collapsing in her home. Event was witnessed by [** 10318**]'s aunt who
   helped the patient to the ground. No head injury. Per the patient's
   [** 10318**] she has felt unwell for for several months, but did not have
   insurance so did not go to see the doctor.  She has been nauseated and
   intermittently vomiting.  She has not eaten anything for the last 4
   days.  Her friend had not noticed that her skin is yellow.  She reports
   the patient has been very depressed lately but does not think the
   patient ingested anything.  She did not notice any confusion, but
   stated that she has been very weak and fatigued.
   .
   The patient was estimated to be down for approx 15 min prior to EMS
   arrival. There are some reports of bystander CPR but that is not
   confirmed. When EMS arrived the patient was pulseless and apneic and
   found to be in V Fib. She was shocked then asystolic and then developed
   PEA arrest. She was given Epi x4 and atropinex3 per ACLS and eventually
   regained pulse shortly after arrival to OSH ED. She was intubated in
   the field. At OSH ED, the patient had SBP to 70/palp. Patient had a Fem
   line placed. Preliminary report of Head CT & CT A/P from OSH were
   negative. She was started on 3 pressors and medflighted to [**Hospital1 5**].
   During transfer she received 2 unit of PRBCs.
   .
   In the ED, initial vs were: 102, 82/19, RR 34, 100% on vent. Pressors
   were increased to max dose. She was given Calcium gluconate 1 amp,
   NaHCO3 2 amps, and started on 1 L NaHCO3, thiamine 100mg IV, The ED was
   unable to place either a radial or a femoral arterial line for BP
   monitoring. Pressors were increased to Dopamine 20, levo 0.5 &
   vasopressin 1.2 drip. Pt was bronched in the ED for concern re:
   misplaced ET tube due to air leak. ET was found to be in right main
   stem and was properly positioned. Bloody secretions were noted in
   bronchi and trachea. In our ED, she was given 1 unit of PRBCs, 1 unit
   FFP & 1 unit Platelets. Her vitals prior to transfer to the floor were:
   102/69, 110, RR 21 at 100% on vent.

   Assessment and Plan:  33 yo female presents after cardiac arrest of
   uncertain eitology.  The patient is  with hypotension, acute
   respiratory failure and multisystem organ failure.  The patient is
   critically ill and her prognosis is extremely poor.
   .
   #  Shock - hypovolemic s/p cardiac arrest. Initial rhythm noted by EMS
   was VFIB. Unclear cause of arrest.  CE, EKG & ECHO not consistent with
   MI.  I feel most likely cause of arrhythmia possibly secondary to
   electrolyte abnormalities or acidosis from toxic ingestion
   - levofed, dopa and vasopressin to keep MAP >65
   - stat ECHO
   - empiric vanco/zosyn for possible sepsis.
   - monitor labs for DIC, hemolysis.
   - arctic sun goal temp 34.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure - continue mechanical ventilation. With maximal
   support patient continues to be hypoxic at this time with high peak
   plateu pressures.  unable to place A line.
   - serial VBGs
   - sedation with fentanyl & midaz
   - t/c paralysis if pressures continue to be high.
   .
   #  Acute Renal Failure - Pt without any urine output since arrival to
   ICU.  Likely dense ATN due to prolonged hypoperfusions of kidneys.
   - renal consult appreciated
   - will place fem HD line & start urgent CVVH
   .
   #  Liver failure - Patient with large increase in LFTs since they were
   done at OSH.  Most likely acute on chronic.  Likely with some
   cirrohosis given EtOH abuse history.
   - trend LFTs coags.

   performed, in v-tach on EMS arrival.  Shock x1 converted to PEA with
   eventual establishment of pulse.  Has required 3 pressors
 dopamine,
   levophed, vaspressin
 since event.  pH 6.8 and lactate > 20 at OSH
   ED.  LifeFlight transport to [**Hospital1 5**] ED.  Continued to require 3
   pressors.  HCO3 drip started.  Cooling initiated.  pH increased
   slightly to 7.0.  Transferred to ICU for further management.
   A/P:  Prognosis poor given prolonged shock.  Her degree of neurologic
   insult from this is not entirely clear but has the potential to be
   severe.  For now we will only plan to cool with target temp of 34-35
   given hemodynamic instability.  Continue current pressor management and
   bicarb gtt. Attempt to place a-line
 multiple attempt at fem a-line
   unsuccessful in ED.  Thiamine given in ED.  Will follow pH and lactate
   closely.  Will obtain echo.
   Pt is critically ill.  Time spent 60 min.

 INDICATION:  Patient with cardiac arrest and fall, please evaluate for
 intracranial hemorrhage.

 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.

 TECHNIQUE:  Helical axial images were obtained through the brain.  No contrast
 was administered.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed.

 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, large masses, mass
 effect, or acute infarct. Bilateral basal ganglia calcifications present. The
 sulci and ventricles are normal in size and configuration.  Vascular
 calcifications are identified in the carotid siphons as well as within the
 bilateral vertebral arteries.  No fracture identified.  A 10 mm ossified
 structure is noted along the inner table of the left frontal bone, of doubtful
 clinical significance. Mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are clear.
 Mucous retention cysts are identified within the bilateral maxillary sinuses,
 and mild mucosal thickening also noted in the ethmoid air cells and sphenoid
 sinus.  No soft tissue swelling noted.

   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12604**] is a 70-year-old man with dyslipidemia, hypertension,
   diabetes, overweight, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation,
   COPD, presenting after cardiorespiratory arrest at home.
   .
   Mr [**Known lastname 12604**] felt unwell yesterday, short of breath and out of sorts.
   This resolved somewhat, but today he again became even more short of
   breath before collapsing at home. His daughter was at home with him and
   began chest compressions after calling 911. AED pads were placed on him
   en route and it his rhythm was shocked, purportedly while in VF,
   although we cannot confirm. He then became asystolic, given
   epinephrine, atropine, defibrillated again twice, given amiodarone and
   intubated in the field. Went to [**Hospital3 519**], by which time he was
   in sinus rhythm with normal blood pressure. Significant labs from that
   admission include D-dimer in 2400s. Cooling commenced and he was
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for further management.
   .
   Upon arrival in the ED his HR was noted to be in the 80s, blood
   pressure in 140s/80s. Oxygen saturation was 98%. He was having
   irregular myoclonic jerks in the ED. Cooling was continued and he was
   sent to the cath. lab. In the cath. lab. his right dominant system
   revealed some diffuse, non-flow-limiting disease, that did not warrant
   intervention (see summary of cath findings below).
   .
   He was transferred to the CCU, already intubated and sedated. Vital
   signs on arrival were 94.8 F, 117 BPM, 142/85 mmHg, RR 21 and 100% O2
   saturation (ventilated on CMV, 22 x 500, PEEP 5, FiO2 100%).

   Microbiology: None. Blood and urine cultures sent.
   ECG: EKG:
   Initially atrial flutter with artifact from myoclonus, with rate in

   normal QRS. Borderline normal/left axis.
   TELEMETRY:
   Sinus rhythm in CCU with numerous ventricular ectopy, including
   ventricular bigeminy. Short runs of ventricular tachycardia.
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2119-4-4**]):
   The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral
   hypokinesis/akinesis. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
   depressed free wall contractility with preservation of apical wall
   motion (consistent with [**Last Name (un) 3596**] sign; raises question of possible
   pulmonary embolus (or other cause of pulmonary hypertension or right
   ventricular dysfunction). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
   regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion.
   .
   ETT:
   None.

   CARDIAC CATH ([**2119-4-4**]):
   1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system demonstrated
   two-vessel disease. The LMCA was short and had no angiographically
   apparent stenosis. The LAD had minimal disease. The LCx had serial
   stenoses, with the distal lesion appearing ulcerated. Neither were
   hemodynamically significant. The ramus intermedius had mild disease.
   The RCA was chronically occluded proximally and filled via left-to
   right collaterals.
   2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial blood
   pressure.
   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report.

   - Add to VF arrest hypothermia study and randomize to receive
   hydrocortisone 100 q8h IV for 7 days post-arrest.
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID
   - Defer digoxin until a.m.
   - Diltiazem 30 mg PO q6h
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Warfarin 5 mg PO QD
   .
   Coma
     Likely hypoxic injury given non-responsiveness and myoclonus.
   Difficult to determine outcome at present, particularly given sedation,
   cooling, paralysis, other medications. Nonetheless, neurologic
   examination shows no reflex activity whatever. Myoclonus can sometimes
   represent post-hypoxic myoclonic epilepsy. EEG at present shows
   near-isoelectric potentials interupted by bursts of slow activity with
   superimposed faster rhythm at similar intervals to which myoclonus was
   observed before paralysis. Seizure possible and will treat if
   indicated.
   - EEG overnight or 48 hours
   - Appreciate Neurology input with respect to EEG
   - Continue cooling for 12 - 24 hours, per protocol, then re-evaluate
   neurologic status as rewarmed, sedation and paralysis weaned.
   .
   Hypotension (and hypertension)
     Improved with some fluid and brief phenylephrine. Will follow,
   particularly now giving back some diltiazem. Was transient after
   catheterization, sedation, cooling.
   - Fluids and pressors to support pressure (phenylephrine)
   - Hold antihypertensives (enalapril, atenolol)
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Active disease that is not thought to be sufficiently flow-limiting
   to produce symptomatic disease. Troponin/enzyme leak not surprising
   given DC cardioversion x 2 or 3 (unclear) and chest compressions, along
   with hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Trend enzymes
   - EKG
   - Telemetry
   - Continue rosuvastatin 20 mg
   - ASA 325 mg
   .
   Question of Gastrointestinal Bleeding
     Some likely clot as cast within OG tube and then removed retaining
   shape. No other blood or concerning output. Could not suction stomach -
   think may be against wall. Low suspicion at present and Hct stable.
   - Continue ASA 325 given CAD
   - Heparin SC TID
   - Warfarin to continue
   - Follow hematocrit
   .
   Diabetes
     Insulin IV for now, given hyperglycemia on arrival. Will convert to
   sliding scale when re-warmed.
   - Insulin IV sliding scale gtt
   - Hold metformin and glipizide while inpatient
   .
   Critical Care and Ventilator

   - Intubation - change endotracheal tube for larger size in a.m. if any
   difficulties suctioning (only a 6)
   - CMV while paralysed and on Artic Sun

   Head Injury
     Head CT clears for bleed and facture. Neck CT/spine CT not performed.
   - Keep in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar until discuss in a.m.

   Liver Enzyme Abnormalities
     Likely early shock liver, but may be medication induced or other.
   Will rise rapidly if shock liver.
   - Follow in a.m.

   Acidosis
     Lactic acidosis, along with respiratory acidosis. Has gap that is
   closing and tracking lactate. Will check blood and urine cultures also,
   but likely secondary to hypoxia. Trending down.

 INDICATION:  70-year-old man, on Coumadin, status post fall with VF arrest,
 now GCS 4.  Evaluate for intracranial bleed.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axially acquired images were obtained through the head without
 contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also displayed.

 FINDINGS:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, large mass or mass
 effect.  There may be a subtle loss of [**Doctor Last Name 107**]-white matter differentiation,
 although the ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration given
 the patient's age.  There is extensive periventricular white matter
 hypodensity, likely representing sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic
 disease; however, given patient's history, infarct cannot be excluded. There
 is extensive atherosclerotic mural calcification involving the cavernous and
 supraclinoid carotid arteries, bilaterally.

 The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  No fracture is
 identified.

 IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Extensive periventricular white
 matter hypodensities which may represent sequelae of chronic small vessel
 ischemic disease; however, given patient's history, infarct cannot be
 excluded.

 NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: As above, there is no intracranial hemorrhage.
 Allowing for the evidence of severe sequelae of chronic microvascular
 infarction, there is no finding to suggest acute vascular territorial
 infarction. There is disproportionate 3rd and lateral ventriculomegaly, which
 may represent central atrophy.

 HISTORY:  70-year-old male with Afib and likely VFib arrest, TTE demonstrated
 strain, elevated D-dimer at OSH.  CTA to evaluate for PE.

 COMPARISON:  Concurrent chest radiograph.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT helical acquisition was performed through the chest before
 and after the uneventful administration of IV contrast.  Multiplanar
 reformations were provided.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is satisfactory opacification of the
 pulmonary artery and its branches.  There is no pulmonary embolus.  There are
 homogenous, dependent, well perfused bibasilar consolidations consistent with
 atelectasis causing near-total collapse but no evidence of infectious
 consolidation or pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.

 Interstitial septal thickening highlights the secondary pulmonary lobules
 throughout, indicative of interstitial fluid overload.  There is mild
 bronchial wall thickening in the lower lobes, right greater than left, which
 is indicative of some degree of airway disease.  There is a small amount of
 endotracheal secretion, likely mucous(3:15).

 There is moderate cardiomegaly including right heart enlargement.  The
 coronary arteries demonstrate abundant calcification.  A nasogastric tube
 extending below axial images is seen on the scout to terminate in the stomach.
 Limited axial imaging of the upper abdomen is otherwise unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  No pulmonary embolus.
 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly including left/right heart.
 3.  Moderate interstitial fluid edema.
 4.  Extensive bilateral lower lobe atelectasis/near lobar collapse.

   setting of a recent increase in lasix dose for fluid retention. The
   underlying substrate is CM. There is concern that some of his ICD
   therapies (ie ATP) actually accelerated VT and led to VF.   Will
   continue with cooling protocol and continue supportive care until his
   mental status can be assessed and we are able to maintain electrical
   stability.
   Critical care time 40 minutes to manage life threatening arrhythmia,
   respiratory failure requiring intubation and cardiac arrest on cooling
   protocol.

   HPI:
   73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD ([**2115**]),  afib
   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA, who was found unresponsive on
   park bench s/p cardiac arrest and loss of pulse during EMS transport on
   way to [**Hospital1 5**] ED.
   .
   Complex story pieced together with family report, ED records, OMR, and
   info from ICD interrogation. Per OMR note, patient had increasing LE
   edema since 6 days PTA, called Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and was told to restart lasix
   20mg [**Hospital1 **]. Per family report, patient had not been feeling well for 2
   days PTA with fatigue, vague symptoms. On AM of admission, pt had ICD
   firing for sensed VT at 11am with LOC prior to shock, with  episode of
   incontinence. Pt called Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at 2pm who thought that patient may
   be hypokalemic, told to take 40meq KCL with planned f/u in [**Hospital 2509**]
   clinic. Patient then went to park to meet friends with possible
   marijuana use (?laced with cocaine) and was found unresponsive on park
   bench for unknown amt of time and EMS called.
   .
   No EMS records, but per ED report, pt had loss of pulse in transport,
   was given seconds of chest compressions, and on arrival in ED at
   5:20pm, was in pulseless wide complex tachycardia concerning for
   polymorphic VT. CPR commenced and pt given epi 1mg x 1, atropine 1mg x
   1, and intubated (initial gas 7/16/32/189), femoral line placed. During
   course in ED, patient went in and out of pulseless VT/WCT (loss of
   pulse for minutes at a time) requiring intermittent shocks by ICD (x 5
   shocks per ICD interrogation between 4:46pm and 5:39pm), external
   defibrillation, and medications (amiodarone, epi, vasopressin,
   atropine). When regained pulse, pt hypotensive (SBP 36-67/26-29) so pt
   started on Neosynephrine and Levophed. Labs significant for INR 4.4,
   Hct 28.2, Cr 1.2, K 2.8. Given 30mg IV KCL, 2mg Mag sulfate, and given
   Hct drop from b/l of 32-35, sent for CT head for concern of bleed in
   setting of elevated INR. Wet read of CT head with no bleed, mass
   effect, or shift. Also given 4amps of Digibind after labs drawn.
   Patient lost pulse while down at CT scan, required one round of
   epi/atropine/CPR and regained pulse after 3 min, and was sent up to CCU
   directly on Neosynephrine at 4.8 and Levophed at 2.6.
   .
   On arrival to CCU, patient was intubated, sedated with fentanyl and
   versed. Met with family for update, identification, and confirmed full
   code. Overnight, Arctic sun cooling protocol initiated, reached goal
   temperature at 8:30pm. Started on dopamine, levophed and neosynephrine
   weaned off. ICD interrogated showing 6 episodes of ATP/shock for sensed
   VT/VF. Bedside ECHO done showing no large change from prior. ECG showed
   v-pacing and resolution of global WCT in limb leads, continued to have
   ACT in precordial leads with changed morphology from old ECG. Repeat
   ABG was 7/22/45/70, PEEP increased to 10. Cr increased from 1.2-> 1.9,
   INR decreased to 3.3, K was 5, lactate was 5.6. Given 20mg IV lasix
   with no response, then 40mg IV x 1 for volume overload by exam, CXR and

   1.The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is elongated.
   The right atrium is moderately dilated.
   2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
   ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global left
   ventricular hypokinesis. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities
   include akinesis of the mid and distal septum, mid and distal inferior
   wall and apex. The remaining segments are severely hypokinetic. The
   remaining left ventricular segments are hypokinetic.
   3. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed. There is an
   echogenic density in the RV consistent with a pacemaker lead.
   4.The aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
   5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
   leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 6.The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a
   restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
   7.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   8.There is no pericardial effusion.

   CARDIAC CATH:  [**6-8**]
     1. Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant system
   without evidence for angiographically significant stenoses.
     2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate pulmonary
   hypertension (PA mean 39 mmHg). The right and left sided filling
   pressures were elevated (RA mean 18 mmHg, RVEDP 20 mmHg, PCW mean 24
   mmHg). Cardiac output and index were reduced (CO 3.5 l/min, CI 1.7
   l/min/m2).
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Coronary arteries are normal.
   2. Elevated left and right sided filling pressures
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now on cooling protocol and pressor support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.
   - Cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - formal EP consult in AM
   - bedside ECHO overnight showed same as prior (mod to severe MR, global
   HK, EF 15%, mod TR, pleural effusion, no pericardial effusion), f/u
   final read
   - Continue cooling protocol with time of goal temperature reached at
   8:30pm. Cool for 18-24hrs, then rewarm slowly), then after patient
   warmed do thorough neuro exam to assess residual functional status
   - Q4hr lytes on cooling protocol, including coags (next at 2am, 6am)
   and closely follow K
   - order for continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - f/u Utox screen, dig level - hold digoxin in meantime
   - f/u CT head final read
   - continue pressors to keep MAP>55, wean down as tolerated (Wean down
   Neo first, then Dopamine)
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - EP consult in AM
   - IV amio bolus prn return to fast VT
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K, Mg
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and pts become

   CT Head [**6-20**]: No acute intracranial process.
   ECHO [**6-20**]: The right atrium is moderately dilated. The left ventricular
   cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15%). Moderate to severe (3+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen.
   CXR [**6-20**]: Marked cardiomegaly, with patchy perihilar opacities most

   Assessment and Plan
   73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD ([**2115**]),  afib
   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, on cooling protocol and pressor
   support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - start Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope (and stop dopamine when start
   milrinone)
   - add neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q4hr lytes on cooling protocol, including coags and closely follow K
   (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - formal EP consult today, will follow on their recs
   - ECHO
   - Continue cooling protocol with time of goal temperature reached at
   8:30pm. Cool for 18-24hrs, then rewarm slowly), then after patient
   warmed do thorough neuro exam to assess residual functional status
   - order for continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - f/u Utox screen
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - EP consult in AM
   - IV amio bolus prn return to fast VT
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and pts become
   coagulopathic on cooling protocol
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Start milrinone/neo/lasix as above
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   with PH 7.32/41/104. FI02 decreased to 70 %
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as noted above.
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 3.3 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.
   - When patient
s INR decreases, will change to different access

   Assessment and Plan
   73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD ([**2115**]),  afib
   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, on cooling protocol and pressor
   support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.
   - Cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - formal EP consult in AM
   - bedside ECHO overnight showed same as prior (mod to severe MR, global
   HK, EF 15%, mod TR, pleural effusion, no pericardial effusion), f/u
   final read
   - Continue cooling protocol with time of goal temperature reached at
   8:30pm. Cool for 18-24hrs, then rewarm slowly), then after patient
   warmed do thorough neuro exam to assess residual functional status
   - Q4hr lytes on cooling protocol, including coags (next 6am) and
   closely follow K
   - order for continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - f/u Utox screen
   - Wean Dopamine as tolerated MAP>55
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - EP consult in AM
   - IV amio bolus prn return to fast VT
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>4), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and pts become
   coagulopathic on cooling protocol
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.

   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - f/u final ECHO report
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   with PH 7.32/41/104. FI02 decreased to 70 %
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as noted above.
   -          follow ABGs, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF

   Cardiac Arrest Consult service Note:
   73 year old male with baseline severe cardiomyopathy (EF 10-15%) who
   suffered cardiac arrest with underlying etiology possibly related to
   hypokalemia with underlying poor substrate.  He was initially very
   hemodynamically unstable in the ED with multiple re-arrests which had
   improved somewhat on admission to CCU though still very
   vasopressor-dependent.  We had initially advised holding off aggressive
   cooling in ED because of recurrent arrests and to begin when patient
   reaches a stable steady state (ie., no re-arrests for 30 minute
   interval or so)
 thus, cooling began with Artic sun in the CCU though
   patient baseline post-arrest temperature was cool so effectively has
   been hypothermic since admission.  At this point, he is on the induced
   hypothermia and continuous EEG pathway.  His vasopressor dependence is
   improving and he is on inotropic support.  He has been entered into the
   post-arrest shock steroids vs. placebo research protocol.
   A: Post-cardiac arrest likely secondary hypokalemia with baseline
   cardiomyopathy
   Plan:
   1)       Neuroprotective Strategies
   a.       Continue cooling for 24 hours and then begin re-warming
   monitor for electrolyte shifts particularly in re-warming phase.  Given
   that the initial suspected reason for arrest in this case was related
   to K+, particular attention should be given to close monitoring during
   re-warming.
   b.       If patient bleeds significantly during cooling protocol would
   re-warm to low-normal temperature (36 degrees)
 should be ok to cool
   with coagulopathy but just monitor coags as you are doing
   c.        Continuous EEG pathway
 neuron/EEG team following
 will
   treat seizure aggressively if present
   d.       Minimize intra-cranial hypertension through simple means
   including elevation of the head of bead and maintenance of normocarbia
   (pCO2 35-40 mmHg) if possible
   e.       Avoid hyperglycemia
   2)       Hemodynamic Support
   a.       Patient receiving pressors and inotropes
   b.       Note that patient is in the post-arrest shock steroid study
   with the endpoint being resolution of vasopressor-dependence.  He will
   receive study drug (hydrocortisone 100 mg) or placebo every 8 hours
   until 24 hours post resolution of vasopressor-dependence.  Note that
   inotropic support (ie., milrinone) is not considered a vasopressor and
   does not effect study protocol.
   3)       Underlying Etiology

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD, anoxic brain injury after
   asystolic cardiac arrest, currently ventilator dependent, presents from
   [**Hospital3 **] with bradycardia, hypotension and hyperkalemia.
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt was initially hypotensive in the ED with BP of
   70/30's.  Pt with known systolic CHF, with EF ~ 30%.  However, BP
   improved after receiving atropine and treatment for his hyperkalemia
   while in the ED up to 120's. BP on arrival to CCU 92/43, HR 53.  Pt is
   s/p ~3L IVF in ED.  Possible that hypotension is related to
   distributive shock physiology given fever in ED, or related to on-going
   bradycardia/junctional rhythm.
   - Hold Carvedilol
   - Hold Lasix
   - Goal MAP >55
   .
   # Bradycardia:  The patient was noted to be bradycardic in the ED tp
   the 40's on arrival.  12-lead EKG showed slow atrial fib vs. a
   junctional rhythm, however his bradycardia improved after treatment of
   his hyperkalemia.  The etiology of this patient's bradycardia is likely
   related to his metabolic derangements in the setting of conduction
   system disease, or an active infection as the patient did spike a fever
   to 102 on arrival.  A temporary pacer was considered but felt to be not
   ideal for this patient at this time given his fevers and likely
   infection.
   - Hold Carvedilol for now
   - EP consult in AM to evaluate for possible PPM placement
   - Pacer pads in place as needed
   - Atropine prn
   .
   # Fevers: Up to 102 in ED. Lactate of 2.3.  UA with mod leuks, several
   WBCs, and many bacteria, with possible source of infection being
   urine.  CXR on [**4-30**] at [**Hospital3 **] suspicious for LLL infiltrate
   and patient was started on Vanc 1gm IV daily on [**5-1**] for MRSA positive
   sputum.
   - Continue empiric ABx coverage for now with Vanc/Zosyn until better
   idea of source given hypotension in ED
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u Blood, Urine cultures
   - pt with no indwelling lines on admission; dirty fem line placed in ED
   to be pulled
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: s/p Kayexalate, IVF and calcium gluconate in ED. Repeat
   K still 5.5, treat as needed w/Kayexalate and insulin, d50, and calcium
   gluconate. Elevated K+ may be related to rising creatnine and worsening
   renal function.
   - f/u K+
   - Kayexalate PRN
   .
   # Type II Resp Failure: Patient is ventilatory dependent, likely due to
   his poor neurologic status. Tracheostomy in place, and patient
   comfortable on CIMV.
   - Continue vent
   - Wean O2 to 40% if possible today
   .
   # CKD: Cr 2.3 on admission within range of prior renal function.
   However, pt with rising Cr (was 1.0 at [**Hospital3 **] several days
   ago), and although Cr within range of previous Creatinines here, pt may
   be in ARF.  BUN noted to be elevated to 160 on admission labs, elevated
   out of proportion to Creatinine.
   - monitor Cr after IVF
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR:  Patient on coumadin for history of St. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 1930**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as well as AFib with INR on admission of 5.6 and PTT of 65.5.  INR
   was 2.0 on [**4-26**] at [**Hospital3 **].  Hct of 25 on admission within
   range of prior Hct's/anemia with no signs of active bleeding other than
   hematuria.
   - Hold coumadin
   - 2mg oral Vitamin K for now
   - FFP if more signs of active bleeding, though not ideal given
   patient's history of CHF and [**Hospital3 **]
   - Follow INR closely with goal 2.5-3.5
   .
   # Hematuria: Supratherapeutic INR on admission as above. Possible
   traumatic foley placement given history of difficult foley placement in
   the past.
   - [**Hospital3 227**] if hematuria continues
   - Reversal of supratherapeutic INR as above
   .
   # CAD: Troponin 0.15 in ED, CK-MB 3. EKG with no ischemic changes.
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: Patient previously on Keppra but no longer on
   anti-epileptic medication while at [**Hospital1 997**].
   - Monitor off anti-epileptics
   .
   # DM2:
   - Lantus, Lispro insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now in case of EP procedure
   # ACCESS: RIJ
   # PROPHYLAXIS: Pneumoboots; hold on SQ Heparin for now given
   supratherapeutic INR
   # CODE: Full.

   in [**3-8**] with subsequent PEG/trach placement, now presents from nursing
   home with hypotension, bradycardia and hyperkalemia.  Patient was found
   to have large b/l pleural effusions.  Patient is tube feed dependent at
   baseline; usual tube feed regimen provides 2304kcals & 115g protein,
   which is grossly overfeeding calories and providing excess protein,
   especially in the setting of acute on CKD.  Given patient
s elevated
   lytes, recommend using a renal formula until patient
s renal function
   improves.
   Medical Nutrition Therapy Plan - Recommend the Following
   1)       Recommend tube feeding goal of Novasource Renal @ 35cc/hr +
   20g Beneprotein (1751kcals, 79g protein).  Start at 15cc/hr, advance
   rate by 10cc q4-6hrs as tolerated to goal.
   2)       H20 flushes per team given renal function.
   3)       Monitor lytes and renal function, patient may be able to
   change to a more standard formula if renal function improves.

 INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male status post cardiac arrest.

 SINGLE SUPINE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Patient is intubated, with an endotracheal
 tube terminating approximately 4.5 cm from the carina. There is no
 pneumothorax.  There is blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles,
 consistent with small pleural effusions.   Increased retrocardiac opacity may
 represent atelectasis, although aspiration and pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 No other focal consolidations are identified. Heart size and mediastinal
 contours are normal. There is no cephalization of pulmonary vasculature or
 pulmonary edema to suggest volume overload or congestive failure.

 Patient is status post median sternotomy, with surgical clips identified in
 the upper mediastinum. There is a minimally displaced posterolateral rib
 fracture of the right fourth rib. A second equivocal fracture is seen in the
 posterior right ninth rib. There are no other fractures identified.
 Surrounding soft tissues are unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube in adequate position.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3.  Retrocardiac opacity could represent atelectasis, aspiration, or
 pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male, found down.  Status post cardiac arrest.  INR of
 21.5.

 COMPARISON:  None available.

 NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:  There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or acute
 large vascular territorial infarction.  Periventricular white matter
 hypodensity likely reflects sequela of small vessel ischemic disease.
 Additional area of low attenuation is identified in the right corona radiata,
 likely a mild lacunar infarct or dilated perivascular space.  [**Doctor Last Name **]-white
 matter differentiation is otherwise preserved.  There is no shift of normally
 midline structures, and the ventricles, sulci, and basal cisterns are normal
 appearance, accounting for prominence secondary to global parenchymal atrphy.
 There is no evidence for fracture, no other suspicious lytic or sclerotic
 osseous lesions. There is minimal mucosal thickening in the bilateral
 maxillary and sphenoid sinuses, the visualized mastoid air cells are normally
 pneumatized and clear.  ET tube is noted.

 IMPRESSION:  Small vessel ischemic disease and global parenchymal atrophy.  No
 evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or acute large vascular
 territorial infarction.

   with BP down to 70 systolic.  He received treated for hyperkalemia
   (Calcium, insulin/d50) and his blood pressure improved, as did his

   unresponsive at baseline who presents with slow af/junctional rhythm,
   hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities and fever.
   1. slow afib/junctional rhythm: Likely secondary to electrolyte
   abnormalities in patient with likely underlying conduction system
   disease.  Unclear reason for hyperkalemia- cr 2.3, but at baseline.
   Will discontinue any hyperk inducing medications (?ace inhibitor,
   spironolactone).  Temporary pacer wire not indicated at this time.  EP
   evaluation for possible pacemaker once infectious issues are resolved.
   IF becomes bradycardic and hypotensive, would first start dopamine for
   chronotropy/inotropy.
   2. Fever:  Patient with positive urinalysis.  Would treat empirically
   for UTI/sepsis and send blood and urine cultures, follow up chest xray.
   Check lipase, lfts. Repeat CXR.
   3. Family unable to be reached from ED. Will continue to try and

   ECHO
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %)
   secondary to extensive akinesis involving the apex and anterior septum;
   there is severe hypkinesis of the anterior free wall, inferior septum,
   and inferior free wall. The basal half of the posterior and lateral
   walls contracts normally. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. A bileaflet aortic
   valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
   seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
   acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: extensive anteroseptal-apical myocardial infarct of unknown
   acuity; inferior hypokinesis; findings consistent with multivessel
   obstructive coronary [**Last Name (un) **] disease
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea prior
   to presentation. Nevertheless no evidence of hypoxia on initial
   presentation. Alternatively, the evidence of systolic failure and
   hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent ischemic event (but no q
   waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination of these two. Less likely
   tamponade, acidosis, PE.
   - needed pressor support overnight, with effective weaning.
   - cte ventilation, decrease FiO2 as able
   - try to ween propofol to better assess brain/seizure activity and f/u
   neuro recs today
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin for AVR and
   PTT 60-90.
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Overnight with decreased u/o.
   Most likely decreased forward flow in the setting of poor EF. No
   evidence of crackles on exam or LE edema, but exam is limited. If blood
   pressure normalizes then may try furosemide to improve forward flow and
   increase renal perfusion. Ionotropic support was briefly necessary.
   Alternative etiology is decreased volume but PCWP is elevated on ECHO.
   BUN/Cre is too high to suggest intrinsic renal cause such as ATN, but
   given his HypoTN this is a possibility.
   # Possible Cardiogenic shock: Has edema and uop now down to almost zero
   - BPs stable and appearts fluid overloaded on exam so will try lasix
   today to increase uop (bolus X 1) follow UOP today
   #
twitching
 movements noted with weaning sedation: concern for
   seizure, but no coordinated movements were noted. His neuro exam was
   unchanged, i.e. fixed/dialated pupils, no doll
s eye.  EEG was
   recording so it should provide clear information. Resolved with
   restarting of sedation. Propofol was chosen for its shorter
 life in
   case need to wean again.
   - F/u neurology recs and wean down propofol prior to their exam to
   allow them to assess seizures.
   # Anemia: HCT this am at 27 down from 31 on admission. VS stable. Will
   monitor, if continues to decrease may need scan for bleeding.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: NPO overnight
   # ACCESS: L femoral line, may need to be d/c
d as placed in the ED but
   will reassess for PIVs prior to d/c
ing.. Add PiVs for more access.
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin ggt
   # CODE: Full. Had long discussion with daughters regarding [**Name2 (NI) **]
   prognosis. They are actively consulting their rabbi [**First Name (Titles) 1986**] [**Last Name (Titles) 6677**] of
   care. Family may not want to increase care but may not be comfortable
   withdrawing care.

   ECHO
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %)
   secondary to extensive akinesis involving the apex and anterior septum;
   there is severe hypkinesis of the anterior free wall, inferior septum,
   and inferior free wall. The basal half of the posterior and lateral
   walls contracts normally. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. A bileaflet aortic
   valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
   seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
   acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: extensive anteroseptal-apical myocardial infarct of unknown
   acuity; inferior hypokinesis; findings consistent with multivessel
   obstructive coronary [**Last Name (un) **] disease
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea prior
   to presentation. Nevertheless no evidence of hypoxia on initial
   presentation. Alternatively, the evidence of systolic failure and
   hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent ischemic event (but no q
   waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination of these two. Less likely
   tamponade, acidosis, PE.
   - needed pressor support overnight, with effective weaning.
   - cte ventilation, decrease FiO2 as able
   - try to ween propofol to better assess brain/seizure activity and f/u
   neuro recs today
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin for AVR and
   PTT 60-90.
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Overnight with decreased u/o.
   Most likely decreased forward flow in the setting of poor EF. No
   evidence of crackles on exam or LE edema, but exam is limited. If blood
   pressure normalizes then may try furosemide to improve forward flow and
   increase renal perfusion. Ionotropic support was briefly necessary.
   Alternative etiology is decreased volume but PCWP is elevated on ECHO.
   BUN/Cre is too high to suggest intrinsic renal cause such as ATN, but
   given his HypoTN this is a possibility.
   # Possible Cardiogenic shock: Has edema and uop now down to almost zero
   - BPs stable and appearts fluid overloaded on exam so will try lasix
   today to increase uop (bolus X 1) follow UOP today
   #
twitching
 movements noted with weaning sedation: concern for
   seizure, but no coordinated movements were noted. His neuro exam was
   unchanged, i.e. fixed/dialated pupils, no doll
s eye.  EEG was
   recording so it should provide clear information. Resolved with
   restarting of sedation. Propofol was chosen for its shorter
 life in
   case need to wean again.
   - F/u neurology recs and wean down propofol prior to their exam to
   allow them to assess seizures.
   # Anemia: HCT this am at 27 down from 31 on admission. VS stable. Will
   monitor, if continues to decrease may need scan for bleeding.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: NPO overnight
   # ACCESS: L femoral line, may need to be d/c
d as placed in the ED but
   will reassess for PIVs prior to d/c
ing.. Add PiVs for more access.
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin ggt
   # CODE: Full. Had long discussion with daughters regarding [**Name2 (NI) **]
   prognosis. They are actively consulting their rabbi [**First Name (Titles) 1986**] [**Last Name (Titles) 6677**] of
   care. Family may not want to increase care but may not be comfortable
   withdrawing care.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 6668**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health care proxy. Above discussed
   with primary care physician: [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 6684**]. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). CCU taem.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Doing poorly, with seizures off sedation by EEG, few reflexes.
   Plan:
   1. Neurology consult for seizure meds
   2. Diuresis given CXR findings, oliguria
   3. Continue close contact with the family - poor prognosis explained to
   them today

   Chief Complaint:  Bradycardia, Hypotension, Hyperkalemia
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 2262**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, h/o aortic valve replacement (St.
   [**Male First Name (un) **]), PAD s/p bypass surgery and recurrent LE ulcers who recently was
   admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] in [**2108-1-29**] following a cardiac arrest at
   home.  The patient was resuscitated within 5 minutes of arresting after
   being found to be pulseless and apneic by the EMS team.  Upon arrival
   to [**Hospital1 19**], he was cooled per protocol following his cardiac arrest.  The
   patient developed seizure activity in the setting of anoxic brain
   injury, and neurologically was felt to have a very grim pronosis.
   Despite this, the patient eventually underwent trach and peg as his
   family wished to keep him full code and he was eventually weaned off
   the ventilator.  He was then discharged to a long term care facility on
   XXX following a prolonged hospitalization with minimal responsiveness
   at baseline.  This evening the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from
   his nursing home after being found to be hypotensive to 86/44 and
   bradycardic to the 40's.  There are notes stating the patient had last
   recieved a dose of carvediolol and lasix approx 12 hours prior to
   arrival in the ED, and a CXR obtained on [**2108-4-30**] at [**Hospital3 **]
   showed bilateral large pleural effusions and a possible LUL infiltrate.
   .
   In the ED, the patient's V/S were: Tm: 102 (rectal) HR 40, BP 90/40 RR
   20 O2 100% on Vent.  The patient's BP was noted to drop down to 75/18
   in ED.
   He received: Vancomycin, Zosyn, 1mg Atropine, 60grams of Kayexalate, 1
   gram of Calcium gluconate, Insulin/D50, and 2.0L of IVF.  A central
   venous line was placed.  HR improved to 60's and SBP improved to 126/42
   after receiving treatment for his hyperkalemia.

   Assessment and Plan
 BRADYCARDIA
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD, anoxic brain injury after
   asystolic cardiac arrest, currently ventilator dependent, presents from
   [**Hospital3 **] with bradycardia, hypotension and hyperkalemia.
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt was initially hypotensive in the ED with BP of
   70/30's.  Pt with known systolic CHF, with EF ~ 30%.  However, BP
   improved after receiving atropine and treatment for his hyperkalemia
   while in the ED up to 120's. BP on arrival to CCU 92/43, HR 53.  Pt is
   s/p ~3L IVF in ED.  Possible that hypotension is related to
   distributive shock physiology given fever in ED, or related to on-going
   bradycardia/junctional rhythm.
   - Hold Carvedilol
   - Hold Lasix
   - Goal MAP >55
   .
   # Bradycardia:  The patient was noted to be bradycardic in the ED tp
   the 40's on arrival.  12-lead EKG showed slow atrial fib vs. a
   junctional rhythm, however his bradycardia improved after treatment of
   his hyperkalemia.  The etiology of this patient's bradycardia is likely
   related to his metabolic derangements in the setting of conduction
   system disease, or an active infection as the patient did spike a fever
   to 102 on arrival.  A temporary pacer was considered but felt to be not
   ideal for this patient at this time given his fevers and likely
   infection.
   - Hold Carvedilol for now
   - EP consult in AM to evaluate for possible PPM placement
   - Pacer pads in place as needed
   - Atropine prn
   .
   # Fevers: Up to 102 in ED. Lactate of 2.3.  UA with mod leuks, several
   WBCs, and many bacteria, with possible source of infection being
   urine.  CXR on [**4-30**] at [**Hospital3 **] suspicious for LLL infiltrate
   and patient was started on Vanc 1gm IV daily on [**5-1**] for MRSA positive
   sputum.
   - Continue empiric ABx coverage for now with Vanc/Zosyn until better
   idea of source given hypotension in ED
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u Blood, Urine cultures
   - pt with no indwelling lines on admission; dirty fem line placed in ED
   to be pulled
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: s/p Kayexalate, IVF and calcium gluconate in ED. Repeat
   K still 5.5, treat as needed w/Kayexalate and insulin, d50, and calcium
   gluconate. Elevated K+ may be related to rising creatnine and worsening
   renal function.
   - f/u K+
   - Kayexalate PRN
   .
   # Type II Resp Failure: Patient is ventilatory dependent, likely due to
   his poor neurologic status. Tracheostomy in place, and patient
   comfortable on CIMV.
   - Continue vent
   - Wean O2 to 40% if possible today
   .
   # CKD: Cr 2.3 on admission within range of prior renal function.
   However, pt with rising Cr (was 1.0 at [**Hospital3 **] several days
   ago), and although Cr within range of previous Creatinines here, pt may
   be in ARF.  BUN noted to be elevated to 160 on admission labs, elevated
   out of proportion to Creatinine.
   - monitor Cr after IVF
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR:  Patient on coumadin for history of St. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 1930**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as well as AFib with INR on admission of 5.6 and PTT of 65.5.  INR
   was 2.0 on [**4-26**] at [**Hospital3 **].  Hct of 25 on admission within
   range of prior Hct's/anemia with no signs of active bleeding other than
   hematuria.
   - Hold coumadin
   - 2mg oral Vitamin K for now
   - FFP if more signs of active bleeding, though not ideal given
   patient's history of CHF and [**Hospital3 **]
   - Follow INR closely with goal 2.5-3.5
   .
   # Hematuria: Supratherapeutic INR on admission as above. Possible
   traumatic foley placement given history of difficult foley placement in
   the past.
   - CBI if hematuria continues
   - Reversal of supratherapeutic INR as above
   .
   # CAD: Troponin 0.15 in ED, CK-MB 3. EKG with no ischemic changes.
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: Patient previously on Keppra but no longer on
   anti-epileptic medication while at [**Hospital1 997**].
   - Monitor off anti-epileptics
   .
   # DM2:
   - Lantus, Lispro insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now in case of EP procedure
   .
   # ACCESS: RIJ
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS: Pneumoboots; hold on SQ Heparin for now given
   supratherapeutic INR

   Chief Complaint:  Bradycardia, Hypotension, Hyperkalemia
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 2262**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, h/o aortic valve replacement (St.
   [**Male First Name (un) **]), PAD s/p bypass surgery and recurrent LE ulcers who recently was
   admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] in [**2108-1-29**] following a cardiac arrest at
   home.  The patient was resuscitated within 5 minutes of arresting after
   being found to be pulseless and apneic by the EMS team.  Upon arrival
   to [**Hospital1 19**], he was cooled per protocol following his cardiac arrest.  The
   patient developed seizure activity in the setting of anoxic brain
   injury, and neurologically was felt to have a very grim pronosis.
   Despite this, the patient eventually underwent trach and peg as his
   family wished to keep him full code and he was eventually weaned off
   the ventilator.  He was then discharged to a long term care facility on
   XXX following a prolonged hospitalization with minimal responsiveness
   at baseline.  This evening the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from
   his nursing home after being found to be hypotensive to 86/44 and
   bradycardic to the 40's.  There are notes stating the patient had last
   recieved a dose of carvediolol and lasix approx 12 hours prior to
   arrival in the ED, and a CXR obtained on [**2108-4-30**] at [**Hospital3 **]
   showed bilateral large pleural effusions and a possible LUL infiltrate.
   .
   In the ED, the patient's V/S were: Tm: 102 (rectal) HR 40, BP 90/40 RR
   20 O2 100% on Vent.  The patient's BP was noted to drop down to 75/18
   in ED.
   He received: Vancomycin, Zosyn, 1mg Atropine, 60grams of Kayexalate, 1
   gram of Calcium gluconate, Insulin/D50, and 2.0L of IVF.  A central
   venous line was placed.  HR improved to 60's and SBP improved to 126/42
   after receiving treatment for his hyperkalemia.

   Assessment and Plan
 BRADYCARDIA
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD, anoxic brain injury after
   asystolic cardiac arrest, currently ventilator dependent, presents from
   [**Hospital3 **] with bradycardia, hypotension and hyperkalemia.
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt was initially hypotensive in the ED with BP of
   70/30's.  Pt with known systolic CHF, with EF ~ 30%.  However, BP
   improved after receiving atropine and treatment for his hyperkalemia
   while in the ED up to 120's. BP on arrival to CCU 92/43, HR 53.  Pt is
   s/p ~3L IVF in ED.  Possible that hypotension is related to
   distributive shock physiology given fever in ED, or related to on-going
   bradycardia/junctional rhythm.
   - Hold Carvedilol
   - Hold Lasix
   - Goal MAP >55
   .
   # Bradycardia:  The patient was noted to be bradycardic in the ED tp
   the 40's on arrival.  12-lead EKG showed slow atrial fib vs. a
   junctional rhythm, however his bradycardia improved after treatment of
   his hyperkalemia.  The etiology of this patient's bradycardia is likely
   related to his metabolic derangements in the setting of conduction
   system disease, or an active infection as the patient did spike a fever
   to 102 on arrival.  A temporary pacer was considered but felt to be not
   ideal for this patient at this time given his fevers and likely
   infection.
   - Hold Carvedilol for now
   - EP consult in AM to evaluate for possible PPM placement
   - Pacer pads in place as needed
   - Atropine prn
   .
   # Fevers: Up to 102 in ED. Lactate of 2.3.  UA with mod leuks, several
   WBCs, and many bacteria, with possible source of infection being
   urine.  CXR on [**4-30**] at [**Hospital3 **] suspicious for LLL infiltrate
   and patient was started on Vanc 1gm IV daily on [**5-1**] for MRSA positive
   sputum.
   - Continue empiric ABx coverage for now with Vanc/Zosyn until better
   idea of source given hypotension in ED
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u Blood, Urine cultures
   - pt with no indwelling lines on admission; dirty fem line placed in ED
   to be pulled
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: s/p Kayexalate, IVF and calcium gluconate in ED. Repeat
   K still 5.5, treat as needed w/Kayexalate and insulin, d50, and calcium
   gluconate. Elevated K+ may be related to rising creatnine and worsening
   renal function.
   - f/u K+
   - Kayexalate PRN
   .
   # Type II Resp Failure: Patient is ventilatory dependent, likely due to
   his poor neurologic status. Tracheostomy in place, and patient
   comfortable on CIMV.
   - Continue vent
   - Wean O2 to 40% if possible today
   .
   # CKD: Cr 2.3 on admission within range of prior renal function.
   However, pt with rising Cr (was 1.0 at [**Hospital3 **] several days
   ago), and although Cr within range of previous Creatinines here, pt may
   be in ARF.  BUN noted to be elevated to 160 on admission labs, elevated
   out of proportion to Creatinine.
   - monitor Cr after IVF
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR:  Patient on coumadin for history of St. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 1930**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as well as AFib with INR on admission of 5.6 and PTT of 65.5.  INR
   was 2.0 on [**4-26**] at [**Hospital3 **].  Hct of 25 on admission within
   range of prior Hct's/anemia with no signs of active bleeding other than
   hematuria.
   - Hold coumadin
   - 2mg oral Vitamin K for now
   - FFP if more signs of active bleeding, though not ideal given
   patient's history of CHF and [**Hospital3 **]
   - Follow INR closely with goal 2.5-3.5
   .
   # Hematuria: Supratherapeutic INR on admission as above. Possible
   traumatic foley placement given history of difficult foley placement in
   the past.
   - CBI if hematuria continues
   - Reversal of supratherapeutic INR as above
   .
   # CAD: Troponin 0.15 in ED, CK-MB 3. EKG with no ischemic changes.
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: Patient previously on Keppra but no longer on
   anti-epileptic medication while at [**Hospital1 997**].
   - Monitor off anti-epileptics
   .
   # DM2:
   - Lantus, Lispro insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now in case of EP procedure
   .
   # ACCESS: RIJ
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS: Pneumoboots; hold on SQ Heparin for now given
   supratherapeutic INR
   .
   # CODE: Full.
   .
   # COMMUNICATION: [**Doctor First Name **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7956**]; unable to be reached from ED.

   hypotension and bradycardia.  In the ED, EKGs showed slow atrial
   fibrillation and junctional bradycardia.  He was initially hypotensive
   with BP down to 70 systolic.  He received treated for hyperkalemia
   (Calcium, insulin/d50) and his blood pressure improved, as did his
   heart rate.  In the ED, he was also found to have a fever to 101/102.

   A/P: 91M with recent cardiac arrest, trach/peg dependent at baseline,
   unresponsive at baseline who presents with slow af/junctional rhythm,
   hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities and fever.
   1. slow afib/junctional rhythm: Likely secondary to electrolyte
   abnormalities in patient with likely underlying conduction system
   disease.  Unclear reason for hyperkalemia- cr 2.3, but at baseline.
   Will discontinue any hyperk inducing medications (?ace inhibitor,
   spironolactone).  Temporary pacer wire not indicated at this time.  EP
   evaluation for possible pacemaker once infectious issues are resolved.
   IF becomes bradycardic and hypotensive, would first start dopamine for
   chronotropy/inotropy.
   2. Fever:  Patient with positive urinalysis.  Would treat empirically
   for UTI/sepsis and send blood and urine cultures, follow up chest xray.
   Check lipase, lfts. Repeat CXR.
   3. Family unable to be reached from ED. Will continue to try and
   contact them to update.

   (aspiration; no evidence of PE) leading to cardiac arrest. No evidence
   of ischemia. Now intubated. Rhythm now in sinus.  CT head negative for
   acute process.  EEG showed seizure activity/burst suppression pattern
   requiring propofol to suppress.

 INDICATION:  A 63-year-old woman with cardiac arrest, to rule out intracranial
 hemorrhage.

 COMPARISON:  No prior studies for comparison.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were acquired through the brain.  No
 contrast was administered.

 FINDINGS:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or
 acute major vascular territorial infarction.  The [**Doctor Last Name 107**]-white matter
 differentiation is well preserved.  The ventricles and sulcal spaces appear
 slightly prominent, related to mild atrophic changes.  The basal cisterns are
 widely patent.

 Soft tissue opacification of the nasopharynx is noted, secondary to the
 intubated status of the patient.  The visualized paranasal sinuses appear
 clear.

 IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute major vascular
 territorial infarction detected.

   Assessment and Plan
 63-year-old woman with history of atrial fibrillation/flutter
   presented after v-fib arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: unclear precipitant for initial v-fib. Might have
   been atrial arrhythmias degenerating into v-fib, or a pulmonary process
   (aspiration; no evidence of PE) leading to cardiac arrest. No evidence
   of ischemia. Now intubated. Rhythm now in sinus.  CT head negative for
   acute process.  EEG showed seizure activity/burst suppression pattern
   requiring propofol to suppress.
   - Artic Sun protocol; re-warm beginning this morning
   - Continue ventilatory support; f/u ABG this morning
   - 48h continuous EEG; f/u Neuro recs
   - HOB > 30
   - f/u chest CTA final read
   .
   # ?Aspiration PNA vs. Pneumonitis:  CT chest showed LUL and LLL
   findings consistent with atelectasis vs. PNA, also with leukocytosis
   and unable to be maintained at 34C yesterday without continual decrease
   of water temp for arctic sun.  Received one dose of Vanc/Zosyn, then
   switched to Levo/Flagyl to cover for aspiration PNA.
   - Continue Levo/Flagyl, consider broadening coverage if no improvement
   - Trend leukocytosis
   - f/u Sputum cx, Bcx
   - f/u final read Chest CT
   .
   # CORONARIES: no evidence of ischemia on ECG. Elevated trop and CK most
   likely from cardiac arrest and CPR. S/p RCA DES in [**2161-7-22**].  TTE this
   morning did not show inferior wall hypokinesis, unlikely ischemic event
   which triggered V fib arrest.
   - f/u TTE final read
   - Continue ASA, clopidogrel
   .
   # PUMP: BP stable with SBP in 100s-120s on minimal Levophed. EF >55% in
   [**2161-7-22**].  Does not appear volume overloaded, though difficult to
   assess.
   - f/u TTE results
   - Wean Levophed
   .
   # RHYTHM: h/o afib, now in sinus. Was initially in V fib then asystole,
   unclear precipitant.  Has been intermittently in a fib/flutter based on
   telemetry overnight.
   - Continue warfarin
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:   Continue levothyroxine

   CCU ATTENDING DAILY PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the comprehensive daily progress note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] today
   and I agree with the history, physical examination, assessment and
   plan.  I was present during the physical examination and concur with
   its findings.
   Addendum to the History:  Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]

   unresponsive.
   Addendum to Physical Examination:  Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
s Note.
   Medical Decision Making.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 8754**] is 53 year old woman with a
   prior AFib with RVR (simulating ventricular tachycardia) in [**2161-7-22**]
   which was treated with a CYPHER DES.   She also had a large ASD with
   significant left to right shunt.   She underwent as is an atrial
   flutter ablation but was pending for a atrial fibrillation ablation
   after 3-6 months of dual antiplatelet therapy for her DES.    She had a
   witnessed cardiac arrest yesterday with ultimately responded to CPR
   although there was question of cerebral anoxia.   Her EKG showed stable
   changes without evidence of stent thrombosis.
   She was cooled for > 18 hours and has not been rewarmed without return
   of cerebral function to date.  She is off pressors and hemodynamically
   stable. We will continue supportive care for her cerebral injury.
   The total time for this visit was 40 minutes and over 50% of the time
   was spent coordinating care.

   (aspiration; no evidence of PE) leading to cardiac arrest. No evidence
   of ischemia. Now intubated. Rhythm now in sinus.  CT head negative for
   acute process.  EEG showed seizure activity/burst suppression pattern
   requiring propofol to suppress.

   Initial visit, Cardiology service: CCU
   Presenting complaint: Arrhythmia
   History of present illness: 53-year-old woman with history of atrial
   fibrillation presented after having v-fib arrest. At her nursing home
   this morning she was found down. EMS was called, finding her to be in
   v-fib. She received shocks x 3, 6 mg total of epinephrine, 300 mg
   loading dose of amiodarone then drip. Intubated in the field. She was
   transported to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], where she was given 1 unit of pRBCs. Guaiac
   reportedly negative. Got a total of 2.5 L of NS. Started on Artic Sun
   before med flight to [**Hospital1 1**].
   .
   On arrival to the [**Hospital1 1**] ED, she was found cold with 8mm fixed pupils
   bilaterally and no response to stimuli. SBP was in the 140s-160s
   without pressor, HR 50s-60s. ECG showed... She got a head CT and chest
   CTA. Transferred to CCU for further management.
   .
   Of note, patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2161-8-12**] to [**2161-8-17**] for
   syncope and runs of VT. Prior to this admission, OSH ETT had shown
   possible mild basal inferior ischemia vs. attenuation artifact with
   overall normal systolic function. She underwent cardiac
   catheterization, which showed a 90% distal RCA stenosis, and a DES was
   placed in the RCA. TTE and TEE showed a large (21 mm) secundum atrial
   septal defect with LVEF>55%. Review of her strip rhythm suggested that
   her arrhythmia may be atrial in origin rather than ventricular
   tachycardia. For that reason, she underwent an EP study on [**2161-8-14**],
   which included ventricular stimulation as well as assessment for atrial
   arrhythmias.  She was found to have inducible atrial flutter, that was
   typical counter clockwise flutter and she had a successful isthmus
   ablation. She had no sustained ventricular tachycardia with ventricular
   stimulation protocol. She was evaluated by the cardiac surgeons as well
   as the interventional cardiologists for percutaneous surgical closure
   of her large secundum ASD, and it was deemed that this should be done
   as an outpatient. In addition, with her history of significant atrial
   arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation, it was thought that a pulmonary
   vein isolation procedure would be beneficial prior to any closure of
   her secundum ASD.

   ECG: (Date: [**2161-11-5**]), sinus with 1-1 AV conduction, rate 73 bpm, nl
   axis, left atrial enlargement, RBBB, no ST/T changes, no Q
   Echocardiogram: (Date: [**2161-8-13**]), The left atrium is dilated. The right
   atrium is moderately dilated. A right-to-left shunt across the
   interatrial septum is seen at rest. A secundum type atrial septal
   defect is present. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no
   ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is markedly
   dilated with borderline normal free wall function. There is abnormal
   septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
   mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Secundum ASD with significant right to left shunting at
   rest. The right ventricle is dilated, borderline hypokinetic with
   evidence of pressure/volume overload. Moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension.
   Cardiac Cath: (Date: [**2161-8-13**]), 1. Coronary angiography in this right
   dominant system demonstrated single vessel disease.  The LMCA had no
   angiographically apparent
   disease.  The LAD and LCx had minor lumenal irregularities.  The large
   RCA had a 90% stenosis of the distal vessel.
   2. Resting hemodynamics revealed a significant atrial shunt, consistent
   with either a patent foramen ovale or an atiral septal defect, with
   Qp/Qs=2.7.  There were elevated right and left sided filling pressures
   with RVEDP of 13 mmHg and LVEDP of 27 mmHg.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension wwith PASP of 50mmHg.  There
   was mild systolic arterial hypertension wiht SBP of 158 mmHg and DBP
   72mmHg. There was no evidence of aortic or mitral stenosis.
   3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the RCA with a 2.5x13mm Cypher stent
   that was postdilated to 3.0. Final angiography revealed no residual
   stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow
   (see PTCA comments).
   4. Successful deployment of 6F Perclose Proglide closure device.

   Medical Decision Making.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 8754**] is 53 year old woman with a
   prior AFib with RVR (simulating ventricular tachycardia) in [**2161-7-22**]
   which was treated with a CYPHER DES.   She also had a large ASD with
   significant left to right shunt.   She underwent as is an atrial
   flutter ablation but was pending for a atrial fibrillation ablation
   after 3-6 months of dual antiplatelet therapy for her DES.    She had a
   witnessed cardiac arrest yesterday with ultimately responded to CPR
   although there was question of cerebral anoxia.   Her EKG showed stable
   changes without evidence of stent thrombosis.
   We will initiate cooling therapy for cerebral protection and maintain
   her hemodynamics as outline by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 785**].
   The total time for this visit was 40 minutes and over 50% of the time
   was spent coordinating care.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  A 63-year-old woman with, status post endotracheal intubation for
 cardiac arrest.
 To asses for ET tube placement.

 COMPARISON:  No prior studies for comparison.

 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is in position and is about 4 cm above the
 carina.  Also noted is a nasogastric tube, which is seen coursing below the
 diaphragms, the distal tip is not visualized in the current study, but likely
 within the stomach.

 There is moderate cardiomegaly with tortuous thoracic aorta.  Hilar contours
 are not clearly visualized on the left.  There is prominence of the right
 hilum, could be related to a dilated pulmonary artery from chronic pulmonary
 hypertension. The left hilum is not well assessed, due to a left upper lobe
 opacity. There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature in both lungs,
 likely accentuated due to low inspiratory lung volumes. Opacities are noted in
 the left upper lobe and left lung base, possibly due to atelectasis or
 aspiration. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

 Multiple rib fractures are noted bilaterally.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  The endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in standard position.
 2.  Left upper lobe and left basilar opacities, possibly due to atelectasis or
 aspiration.
 3.  Prominent right pulmonary artery, could be related to chronic pulmonary
 hypertension.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  A 63-year-old woman status post cardiac arrest, to rule out
 pulmonary embolism.

 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT of the chest was performed prior to and following the
 administration of nonionic intravenous contrast media as per PE protocol.
 Sagittal and coronal reformats were generated and reviewed.

 FINDINGS:  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is no pericardial effusion.
 There is calcification of the coronary arteries.  Thoracic aorta has a normal
 course and caliber, with scattered atherosclerotic calcifications.

 Dilatation of the main, right and left pulmonary arteries is compatible with
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.  No evidence of filling defects in the
 pulmonary arteries, to suggest pulmonary embolism.  No significant
 mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy detected.

 The airways are patent up to the subsegmental levels. There are airspace
 opacities noted in the dependent portions of both lung, including the
 posterior aspects of the right and left upper lobes and the posterior basal
 segment of the left lower lobe, secondary to aspiration. There is
 isoattenuating material noted in the left main bronchus, related to aspirated
 secretions. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

 Osseous structures and soft tissues: Multiple rib fractures are noted
 involving the anterior left second,third,fourth,fifth and sixth ribs, of which
 3,5 and 6 are displaced fractures. Undisplaced rib fractures are noted in the
 anterior right second, third, fourth and fifth ribs.  The nasogastric tube is
 seen terminating in the proximal stomach.  The endotracheal tube is in good
 position.

 Visualized portion of the liver, spleen, in the non-contrast study appears
 unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute pulmonary embolism or acute thoracic aortic pathology detected.

 Ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration.  Periventricular
 white matter hypodensities are most notable posteriorly, but are consistent
 with chronic small vessel ischemic change.  The [**Doctor Last Name 107**]-white matter
 differentiation is preserved.  Basilar cisterns are symmetric.  There is no
 fracture.  Mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses demonstrate mild mucosal
 thickening of left sphenoid air cell, and aerosolized material within the
 nasal cavity and visualized nasopharynx, consistent with intubation.

 IMPRESSIONS:  No acute intracranial abnormality.  No intracranial hemorrhage
 or loss of [**Doctor Last Name 107**]-white matter differentiation.

   Cardiac Arrest Consult Note:
   71 year old male history of end-stage heart failure on coumadin who
   suffered v. fib arrest.  Downtime remains somewhat unclear but likely
   6-8 minutes.  Initially at OSH where he was started on dopamine for
   hypotension and transferred to [**Hospital1 19**].  His BP worsened and now
   requiring two vasopressors (norepinephrine and phenylephrine).  On
   exam, he is [**Age over 90 **] degrees rectally, P 70, BP 90s/60s on vasopressors,
   mechanically ventilated (Vt 600, RR 20, Fio2 1.0, PEEP 5) with oxygen
   saturation of 95%.  His exam is notable for intermittent posturing.
   Extremities cool.
   Data: HCT is negative, lactate 2.4, BUN/Cr = 98/5.3, CXR
   infiltrates
   Assessment:
   1)       S/P v. fib cardiac arrest in comatose state with posturing
   2)       Shock (vasopressor-dependent)
   3)       Acute Respiratory Failure
   4)       Renal Failure
   Plan:
   1)       Given comatose with posturing, patient is appropriate for
   induced hypothermia from a neurologic standpoint.  His cooling at this
   point has been appropriately delayed because of hemodynamic
   instability.  Given that BP relatively stabilized on vasopressors,
   would initiate cooling with arterial line for BP monitoring.
   2)       Though patient coagulopathic, still ok for cooling but if
   develops any life-threatening bleed then would set temperature to 36-37
   and abort further cooling
   3)       Continuous EEG in the morning to evaluate for sub-clinical
   seizures
   4)       Avoid hypercarbia and hyperglycemia
   5)       Keep head of the bed elevated > 30 degrees to mitigate
   intra-cranial hypertension
   6)       Underlying etiology evaluation per primary team though likely
   arrhythmia secondary to poor underlying cardiac function
   7)       Please page with questions ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1219**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1526**] [**Numeric Identifier 7916**]).  Automatic
   consult has been made to neurology (EEG team) and they will read EEG
   tomorrow and follow patient.

   IMAGING:
   [**2148-11-29**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
   ventricular cavity size is borderline dilated. There is severe regional
   left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral
   akinesis. There is moderate to severe hypokinesis of the remaining
   segments (LVEF <20%). The estimated cardiac index is depressed
   (<2.0L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
   The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global
   free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic septal
   motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload, as
   well as a conduction abnormality or RV apical pacing. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
   no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is at
   least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, athough this may be
   underestimated given severity of TR. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe regional and global
   systolic dysfunction, c/w prior extensive inferior myocardial
   infarction and a superimposed process (or multivessel CAD). Markedly
   dilated right ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction. Mild
   aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
   Depressed cardiac index and at least mild pulmonary hypertension.
   CXR: ETT balloon hyperinflated. Low lung volumes, with possible mild
   vascular congestion. Moderate cardiomegaly.
   CT head: No acute intracranial abnormality. No intracranial hemorrhage
   or loss of [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation.

   #. VF Arrest: Pt reportly found in VF arrest with ROSC after 2 shocks
   by EMS. On ECG rhythm shows likely sinus tach with LBBB. Unclear as to
   whether patient was actually in VF arrest given no rhythm strips with
   records. The patient reportly has had episodes of VT in the past and is
   on Mexiletine. He also has a AICD that did not fire per report. The
   patient was started on lidocaine gtt and cooling was initiated.  Likely
   arrhythmia in the setting of severe cardiomyopathy (likely ischemic)
   given history. Unlikely ACS given ECG and prior cath 3 months prior.
   CE mildly elevated, but likely combination of demand and and CKD.

   occluded grafts, but no intervention per wife. ECG shows LBBB, no old
   to compare. CE elevated with Trop 0.16 and CK 521, MB: 13. Given
   patient's comorbidities including severe CHF, CKD and poor functional
   status and recent cath the patient would likely benefit from medical
   management at this time.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Pt remains sedated and intubated. No spontaneous movements yet but he
   remains on Fentanyl and Versed. EEG and post-arrest study drug
   continue. He is now warming as cooling has completed. Volume status is
   + 4.7L per 24 hours and CXR shows CHF. Fio2 has increased to 50% as
   well. WBC improving, creat fluctuating around 4.8. CK peak is 520 with
   MB 13. LFTs are slightly lower than yesterday. Echo shows global hypo
   with EF 20% (down from 35% from outside cardiologist). ICD
   interrogation demonstrates multiple episodes of VT treated by ATP and
   no shocks but no events to corrospond to 7pm Friday when the patient
   arrested per his family. Today we will lighten or discontinue the
   sedation and assess underlying neuro function. Continue amio and
   mexilitine per neuro for VT. Increase Dobuta to 5 mcg/kg/min to augment
   CI (1.1 by echo) as well as lasix drip.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health
   care proxy. I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 7045**] and [**Doctor Last Name 2351**].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.

 INDICATION:  CAD, status post left IJ line.

 COMPARISON:  [**2148-11-29**].

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, an IJ line has been
 inserted over the left side.  The tip of the line visually projects over the
 aortic knob.  It is likely to be located in the very proximal part of the
 brachiocephalic vein.  For proper positioning within the superior vena cava,
 the line should be advanced by at least 8 cm.

 No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.  Otherwise, unchanged
 to previous examination.

   home this evening when he told his wife he was having another heart
   attack. He then had a witnessed collapse and was down for ~6 minutes
   before EMS arrived and found him to be in an arrhythmia which required
   a shock. One defib was dekivered on site by medics per patient's
   daughter. They did see CPR administered at the s cene but the patient
   left his home with a spontaneous rhythm and HR.  At that time he was

   ""down time"" was more than 5 minutes but no more than 10 minutes. Creat
   was 6.0 and the patient has a history of CRI and his family thinks his
   baseline creat is 3.0. He was brought to CCU afetr a code STEMI was

   Lido and Levofed. We will get the results of the patient's recent cath.
   Cont ASA, Plavix, BB ACEI. We will speak with the neuro service
   regarding the patient's chance for meaningful recovery after 3 days. I
   have spoken in detail with the patient's wife, son and daughter.

   71 yo M with PMH significant for CHF (EF: 20-25%), CAD s/p CABG, CKD,
   a-fib on coumadin, s/p ICD, presents after VF arrest.  Per the family
   the patient had been complaing of dizziness over the last few months.
   He does have a history of VT per the wife with 2 episodes of syncope in

   #. VF Arrest: Pt reportly found in VF arrest with ROSC after 2 shocks
   by EMS. On ECG rhythm shows likely sinus tach with LBBB. Unclear as to
   whether patient was actually in VF arrest given no rhythm strips with
   records. The patient reportly has had episodes of VT in the past and is
   on Mexiletine. He also has a AICD that did not fire per report. The
   patient was started on lidocaine gtt and cooling was initiated.  Likely
   arrhythmia in the setting of severe cardiomyopathy (likely ischemic)
   given history. Unlikely ACS given ECG and prior cath 3 months prior.
   CE mildly elevated, but likely combination of demand and and CKD.

   occluded grafts, but no intervention per wife. ECG shows LBBB, no old
   to compare. CE elevated with Trop 0.16 and CK 521, MB: 13. Given
   patient's comorbidities including severe CHF, CKD and poor functional
   status and recent cath the patient would likely benefit from medical
   management at this time.

 HISTORY:  V-Fib.  Intubation.

 One view.  Comparison with [**2148-11-29**].  There is interval development of hazy
 increased density bilaterally and the pulmonary vasculature is indistinct
 consistent with development of pulmonary edema.  The retrocardiac area is
 dense and the left hemidiaphragm is obscured consistent with atelectasis or
 consolidation and possibly pleural fluid.  The heart appears enlarged as
 before.  The patient is status post median sternotomy as demonstrated
 previously.  Mediastinal structures are unchanged.  The endotracheal tube,
 nasogastric tube, left internal jugular catheter and ICD remain in place.

 IMPRESSION:  Development of pulmonary edema and left basilar atelectasis or
 consolidation and possibly pleural fluid.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  CTA chest with and without contrast and reconstructions.

 INDICATION:  Cardiac arrest with intubation and desaturation.

 COMPARISONS:  None available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axially acquired images were obtained from the thoracic inlet
 to the upper abdomen after the uneventful intravenous administration of 100 ml
 Optiray 350  contrast material.  Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained
 and reviewed.

 CTA CHEST:  No filling defects are identified within the pulmonary arteries to
 suggest acute pulmonary embolism.  No dissection flap is present within the
 thoracic aorta.  The ascending aorta is dilated to 4.5 cm. There are bibasilar
 consolidations, which are moderate consistent with aspiration versus
 pneumonia.  No pulmonary masses are identified.  Endotracheal tube is well
 positioned approximately 4 cm from the carina.  NG tube courses through the
 esophagus with tip and side port terminating within the stomach.

 There is cardiomegaly and evidence of prior coronary artery bypass grafting
 with median sternotomy wires intact.  Three-vessel coronary artery
 calcifications are present.  There is calcification of the aortic valve.
 Incidental note is made of duplicated IVC with the left-sided IVC emptying
 into a dilated coronary sinus.  A right-sided pacemaker is present with leads
 terminating in the expected right atrium and right ventricle.  No pericardial
 effusion is present.

 Incidental note is made of a small amount of fluid surrounding the
 endotracheal tube proximally (series 3:  image 3).

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  No pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic dissection.

 2.  Small-to-moderate bibasilar consolidation with aspiration favored over
 pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  Differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and scar
   tissue causing arrhythmia.  Based on strip review from pacer, appears
   to be polymorphic VT which is more likely ischemic.  No ST changes or
   reperfusion seen on ECG.  Patient has 11 year old graft which may no
   longer be patent.  Other etiologies (electrolyte disturbances,
   hypothermia, PE) less likely.  Limited neurologic function off sedation
   per ED, with absent corneal reflexes on exam, but did open eyes to name
   prior to paralytic use.  Artic sun cooling protocol initiated.
   - cooling patient for 18-24 hrs
   - paralytics to reduce shivering
   - fentanyl/midazolam sedation.
   - ventilatory support and wean as tolerated following cooling
   - neuro evaluation once cooling complete and sedation weaned
   # CORONARIES:  Patient with history of CAD. No ischemic changes on EKG,
   although limited to interpret with V pacing.  CK and troponin elevation
   likely from VT and shocks.  As discussed, polymorphic VT may be from
   ischemia.
   - full dose aspirin
   - Metoprolol 25mg PO TID
   - already anticoagulated on coumadin, holding heparin
   - will likely need cath on monday
   - checking lipid panel and hbga1c (pending)
   .
   # PUMP:  Final TTE pending; although preliminary read shows severely
   reduced EF.  Not clinically in failure.
   - Metoprolol and Lisinopril
   - f/u TTE read
   .
   # RHYTHM: PPM interrogations likely with VF.  Patient received 2 shocks
   from AED.  Patient currently in AF w/ v-pacing
   - if has evidence of neurologic recovery, EP c/s for ICD placement.
   - holding coumadin with possible catherization
   - EP consult to assess rhythm strip
   .
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension.
   - Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril as per home doses

   to the LAD and D1, and hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital1 **] with STEMI and is now s/p DES to the RCA.
   .
   # Right Ventricular Infarct:  The patient presented with chest pain and
   subsequently lost consciousness at [**Hospital3 519**].  He was found to
   have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour of resuscitiation,
   subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a fresh thrombus in the
   mid-RCA.  Heparin and integrilin gtts were held, and he was started on
   cooling protocol.  He was on Dopamine briefly prior to cardiac
   catheterization. Rewarming starts at 1130
    - Continue cooling protocol with Fentanyl/Verset for sedation and
   Vecuronium for paralytics for 18 hours
    - Continue to monitor CK, troponins x3
    - TTE today
    - Continue to hold heparin and integrilin, given significant bleeding
   from nose
    - Hold on Lasix for now, as patient is pre-load dependent
    - Give IVFs as needed to maintain MAPs > 60
    - Continue Dopamine to maintain MAP > 60.
    - Monitor for bradycardia, hypotension, and electrolyte shifts with
   cooling protocol
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
    - Increase Lipitor to 80 mg daily
    - Start low dose BB as BP tolerates
    - Repeat ECG  this AM
    - Replete lytes
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress:  The patient was intubated at [**Hospital3 519**]
   in the setting of cardiac arrest.  He was fighting the ventilator on
   arrival and his initial ABG was 7.23/40/273.  After cardiac
   catheterization, he became more stable on the ventilator and his
   current ABG returned 7.47/24/206; Improving, but now with low pCO@
    - Continue on CMV during cooling protocol
    - Aim for pO2 in the low 100s (decrease free radicals) and CO2 between
   35 and 40.
    - Continue VAP precautions with raising the HOB to 30%
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  The patient had an acute RV
   infarct this afternoon, and his hemodynamics in the cath lab
   demonstrated increased biventricular filling pressures.  He does not
   have a known history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated
   filling pressures are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
    - TTE today
    - Hold on diuresis for now, as patient is pre-load dependent.
    - Dopamine gtt for now to increase contracility and CO
   .
   # Nose bleed:  The patient had a persistent nose bleed this afternoon
   in the setting of traumatic NGT placement and integrilin/heparin gtts.
   The bleeding appears to have stopped with Afrin nasal spray, and the
   patient's Hct has remained stable.
    - Recheck Hct q6h
    - Continue Afrin NS
    - Consider ENT C/S if bleeding starts again.
   .
   #Lactic Acidosis: Lactate 10 in cath to 4.1 today; improving
      - 2 amps of bicarb given
      - Consult with RT to balance RR with acidosis
      - continue to monitor with q 12 lactates
   #Shock Liver: Elevated Enzymes s/p resuscitation AST 415 ALT 288
   currently AST: ALT:
   - Continue to monitor daily LFTs
   .
   # Diabetes: Unsure of home medications as cannot obtain records or an
   emergency contact
         -Elevated BS on Chemistries
        - Start sliding scale today and continue to monitor FSBS
   #  Identity:  The patient presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with minimal
   paperwork, after driving there himself.  Records from [**Hospital1 12**] gave his
   mother, [**Name (NI) 7816**] [**Name (NI) 7817**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 7818**]) as his next of [**Doctor First Name 23**].  He is single
   and not married.  The patient has a cell phone, but no saved numbers.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES
   to the LAD and D1, and hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital1 **] with STEMI and is now s/p BMS to the RCA.
   .
   # STEMI:  The patient presented with chest pain and subsequently lost
   consciousness at [**Hospital3 519**].  He was found to have STe in II, III,
   AVF, and after one hour of resuscitiation, subsequent cardiac
   catheterization demonstrated a fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.  Heparin
   and integrilin gtts were held, and he was started on cooling protocol.
   He was on Dopamine briefly prior to cardiac catheterization. Rewarming
   starts at 1130
    - Continue cooling protocol with Fentanyl/Verset for sedation and
   Vecuronium for paralytics for 18 hours
    - Continue to monitor CK, troponins x3
   - Continue to hold heparin and integrilin, given significant bleeding
   from nose
    - Hold on Lasix for now, as patient is pre-load dependent
    - Give IVFs as needed to maintain MAPs > 60
    - Continue Dopamine to maintain MAP > 60.
    - Monitor for bradycardia, hypotension, and electrolyte shifts with
   cooling protocol
   -  Atropine if patient becomes increasingly bradycardic.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
    - Increase Lipitor to 80 mg daily
    - Start low dose BB as BP tolerates
    - Repeat ECG  tomorrow AM.
    - Replete lytes
   - TTE tomorrow
   - If pt develops pulmonary edema, consider acute MR, contact cards
   fellow.
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress:  The patient was intubated at [**Hospital3 519**]
   in the setting of cardiac arrest.  He was fighting the ventilator on
   arrival and his initial ABG was 7.23/40/273.  After cardiac
   catheterization, he became more stable on the ventilator and his
   current ABG returned 7.47/24/206; Improving, but now with low pCO@
    - Continue on CMV during cooling protocol
    - Aim for pO2 in the low 100s (decrease free radicals) and CO2 between
   35 and 40.
    - Continue VAP precautions with raising the HOB to 30%
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  The patient had an acute RV
   infarct this afternoon, and his hemodynamics in the cath lab
   demonstrated increased biventricular filling pressures.  He does not
   have a known history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated
   filling pressures are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
    - TTE tomorrow.
    - Hold on diuresis for now, as patient is pre-load dependent.
    - Dopamine gtt for now to increase contracility and CO
   .
   # Nose bleed:  The patient had a persistent nose bleed this afternoon
   in the setting of traumatic NGT placement and integrilin/heparin gtts.
   The bleeding appears to have stopped with Afrin nasal spray, and the
   patient's Hct has remained stable.
    - Recheck Hct q6h
    - Continue Afrin NS
    - Consider ENT C/S if bleeding starts again.
   .
   #Lactic Acidosis: Lactate 10 in cath to 4.1 today; improving
      - 2 amps of bicarb given
      - Consult with RT to balance RR with acidosis
      - continue to monitor with q 12 lactates
   #Shock Liver: Elevated Enzymes s/p resuscitation AST 415 ALT 288 and
   trended down this AM.
   - Continue to monitor daily LFTs
   .
   # Diabetes: Unsure of home medications as cannot obtain records or an
   emergency contact
         -Elevated BS on Chemistries
        - Start sliding scale today and continue to monitor FSBS
   #  Identity:  The patient presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with minimal
   paperwork, after driving there himself.  Records from [**Hospital1 12**] gave his
   mother, [**Name (NI) 7816**] [**Name (NI) 7817**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 7818**]) as his next of [**Doctor First Name 23**].  He is single
   and not married.  The patient has a cell phone, but no saved numbers.
    - Consider Ethics C/S in the am re: calling numbers from phone in
   order to alert family
    - Re-attempt calling patient's mother in am.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES
   to the LAD and D1, and hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital1 **] with STEMI and is now s/p DES to the RCA.
   .
   # Right Ventricular Infarct:  The patient presented with chest pain and
   subsequently lost consciousness at [**Hospital3 519**].  He was found to
   have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour of resuscitiation,
   subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a fresh thrombus in the
   mid-RCA.  Heparin and integrilin gtts were held, and he was started on
   cooling protocol.  He was on Dopamine briefly prior to cardiac
   catheterization.
    - Continue cooling protocol with Fentanyl/Verset for sedation and
   Vecuronium for paralytics for 18 hours
    - Continue to monitor CK, troponins x3
    - Repeat TTE today
    - Continue to hold heparin and integrilin, given significant bleeding
   from nose
    - Hold on Lasix for now, as patient is pre-load dependent
    - Give IVFs as needed to maintain MAPs > 60
    - Start Dobutamine if needed to maintain MAP > 60.
    - Monitor for bradycardia, hypotension, and electrolyte shifts with
   cooling protocol
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
    - Increase Lipitor to 80 mg daily
    - Start low dose BB as BP tolerates
    - Repeat ECG in the am
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress:  The patient was intubated at [**Hospital3 519**]
   in the setting of cardiac arrest.  He was fighting the ventilator on
   arrival and his initial ABG was 7.23/40/273.  After cardiac
   catheterization, he became more stable on the ventilator and his
   current ABG returned at
    - Continue on CMV during cooling protocol
    - Aim for pO2 in the low 100s (decrease free radicals) and CO2 between
   35 and 40.
    - Continue VAP precautions with raising the HOB to 30%
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  The patient had an acute RV
   infarct this afternoon, and his hemodynamics in the cath lab
   demonstrated increased biventricular filling pressures.  He does not
   have a known history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated
   filling pressures are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
    - TTE today
    - Hold on diuresis for now, as patient is pre-load dependent.
   .
   # Nose bleed:  The patient had a persistent nose bleed this afternoon
   in the setting of traumatic NGT placement and integrilin/heparin gtts.
   The bleeding appears to have stopped with Afrin nasal spray, and the
   patient's Hct has remained stable.
    - Recheck Hct q6h
    - Continue Afrin NS
    - Consider ENT C/S if bleeding starts again.
   .
   #Shock Liver: Elevated Enzymes s/p resuscitation
   - Continue to monitor
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   .
   #  Identity:  The patient presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with minimal
   paperwork, after driving there himself.  Records from [**Hospital1 12**] gave his
   mother, [**Name (NI) 7816**] [**Name (NI) 7817**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 7818**]) as his next of [**Doctor First Name 23**].  He is single
   and not married.  The patient has a cell phone, but no saved numbers.
    - Consider Ethics C/S in the am re: calling numbers from phone in
   order to alert family
    - Re-attempt calling patient's mother in am.

   HPI:
   The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o DM, CAD s/p stents to D1 and LCx,
   who presented from [**Hospital3 **] as a Code STEMI.  The patient was
   reportedly in his normal state of health until noon on [**8-27**], when he
   was lifting furniture and developed chest pain.  He reportedly had
   associated diaphoresis and lightheadedness.  An hour and a half later,
   the patient drove himself to [**Hospital3 519**], where he continued to
   have substernal chest pain.
   .
   On arrival to the ED, the patient was noted to be ashen but conversant
   and AAO x3.  His initial VS were BP 130/77, P 51, R 14, O2 97% on RA,
   Wt 233 lbs.  On transfer to the ED stretcher, the patient went into
   VFib arrest.  He was coded for 54 minutes, during which time he was
   intubated and received 12 mg Epinepherine, 5 mg of Atropine, and was
   started on Lidocaine and Dopamine gtts.  Cooling protocol was
   initiated, and he was then transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] as code STEMI for
   cardiac catheterization.
   .
   In the cath lab, the patient was found to have a total occlusion of the
   mid-RCA.  He underwent successful primary PCI and had a BMS placed in
   his RCA.  He was weaned off the pressors, and heparin and integrilin
   were discontinued as the patient continued to have substantial bleeding
   from his nares.

   Imaging: CXR ([**8-27**]): No acute cardiopulmonary process. ET, Swan-Ganz,
   NGT, in standard positions
   .
   CARDIAC CATH: 1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-domimant
   system revealed single-vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
   significant stenoses.  The LAD had mild diffuse disease and patent
   stents in the first diagonal with moderate diffuse restenosis.  The LCX
   had patent proximal stent and a large OM2 branch with mild diffuse
   disease.  The RCA had an acute mid-vessel total occlusion  2.  Resting
   hemodynamics demonstrated elevated biventricular filling pressures and
   RA / PCWP pressures suggestive of right ventricular infarction, with
   depressed cardiac output.
   3.  Post PCI bleeding was observed in the left nares, with resolved
   with manual pressure and cessation of integrilin.
   ECG: Junctional rhythm with rate of 50 BPM.  ST elevation in II (9 mm),
   III (12 mm), and AVF (12mm).  ST depressions in I, AVL, V1, V2, V3.
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES
   to the LAD and D1, and hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital1 **] with STEMI and is now s/p DES to the RCA.
   .
   # Right Ventricular Infarct:  The patient presented with chest pain and
   subsequently lost consciousness at [**Hospital3 519**].  He was found to
   have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour of resuscitiation,
   subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a fresh thrombus in the
   mid-RCA.  Heparin and integrilin gtts were held, and he was started on
   cooling protocol.  He was on Dopamine briefly prior to cardiac
   catheterization.
    - Continue cooling protocol with Fentanyl/Verset for sedation and
   Vecuronium for paralytics for 18 hours
    - Continue to monitor CK, troponins x3
    - Repeat TTE tomorrow
    - Continue to hold heparin and integrilin, given significant bleeding
   from nose
    - Hold on Lasix for now, as patient is pre-load dependent
    - Give IVFs as needed to maintain MAPs > 60
    - Start Dobutamine if needed to maintain MAP > 60.
    - Monitor for bradycardia, hypotension, and electrolyte shifts with
   cooling protocol
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
    - Increase Lipitor to 80 mg daily
    - Start low dose BB as BP tolerates
    - Repeat ECG in the am
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress:  The patient was intubated at [**Hospital3 519**]
   in the setting of cardiac arrest.  He was fighting the ventilator on
   arrival and his initial ABG was 7.23/40/273.  After cardiac
   catheterization, he became more stable on the ventilator and his ABG
   returned at 7.37/37/325.
    - Continue on CMV during cooling protocol
    - Aim for pO2 in the low 100s (decrease free radicals) and CO2 between
   35 and 40.
    - Continue VAP precautions with raising the HOB to 30%
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  The patient had an acute RV
   infarct this afternoon, and his hemodynamics in the cath lab
   demonstrated increased biventricular filling pressures.  He does not
   have a known history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated
   filling pressures are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
    - TTE tomorrow
    - Hold on diuresis for now, as patient is pre-load dependent.
   .
   # Nose bleed:  The patient had a persistent nose bleed this afternoon
   in the setting of traumatic NGT placement and integrilin/heparin gtts.
   The bleeding appears to have stopped with Afrin nasal spray, and the
   patient's Hct has remained stable.
    - Recheck Hct q6h
    - Continue Afrin NS
    - Consider ENT C/S if bleeding starts again.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   .
   #  Identity:  The patient presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with minimal
   paperwork, after driving there himself.  Records from [**Hospital1 12**] gave his
   mother, [**Name (NI) 7816**] [**Name (NI) 7817**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 7818**]) as his next of [**Doctor First Name 23**].  He is single
   and not married.  The patient has a cell phone, but no saved numbers.
    - Consider Ethics C/S in the am re: calling numbers from phone in
   order to alert family
    - Re-attempt calling patient's mother in am.

"1102",2081,80134,"Chief Complaint:  s/p cardiac arrest
   HPI: 36yo male with medical history notable for morbid obesity was
   admitted from the ED s/p cardiac arrest.
   Patient was found by his family having tonic-clonic movements and
   unresponsive. EMS was called and patient was found to be in Vfib
   arrest. He was initially cardioverted at 200J, and rhythm converted to
   asystole. He received epi, atropine, narcan, and 100mg lidocaine for
   recurrent VF. He was defibrillated again with conversion to sinus
   tachycardia. He was intubated and started on a lidocaine drip.
   Hypothermia cooling protocol was initiated at that time, and he was
   taken to an OSH. At the OSH, vital signs on arrival were BP 111/66, HR
   98, RR 23, temp 98.5, and O2 sat 96% on vent (unclear settings at the
   time). He was administered midazolam 8mg total, ativan 2mg IV x 2,
   lopressor 5mg IV x 1, and 1L normal saline bolus. The patient was then
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]. Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 19**], vital signs were temp
   37.9, HR 142 / BP 139/50, RR 48, and O2 sat 97% on vent (unclear what
   the settings were). He was switched to propofol boluses for sedation.
   He was started on the arctic sun protocol and transferred to the floor.
   He required vecuronium x 1 for paralysis.
   Patient is intubated and sedated and full review of systems could not
   be obtained.  In discussion with his wife, patient was dizzy one day
   ago when he bent over to pick up something. On this day of admission,
   patient was in his usual state of health. He and his wife went [**Name2 (NI) 6625**]
   without any complications. On the evening of admission, she heard a
   noise in their bedroom and found that he had whole body shaking, eyes
   rolling back into his head. She called 911. She thinks he was breathing
   but unsure if he had a pulse.

   Assessment and Plan
   36yo male with morbid obesity was admitted s/p cardiac arrest at home.
   1. s/p Arrest
   Etiology of his arrest is unclear and will be very difficult to assess
   given that he was unmonitored at the time of the event. Given patient's
   multiple medical problems including sleep apnea, asthma, and morbid
   obesity, a likely etiology of his arrest is arrest in the setting of
   hypoxia related to his obesity-hypoventilation, sleep apnea, and
   asthma. Additional differential diagnosis includes ischemia, structural
   heart disease, and arrhythmia, although patient has no prior history of
   any of these abnormalities. An additional possibility includes a
   non-cardiac cause of hemodynamic instability resulting in a PEA arrest,
   although patient has no specific localizing symptoms or signs.
   - ECG upon arrival to the floor
   - rule-out MI
   - check fasting lipids in the AM
   - consider cardiac catheterization once more hemodynamically stable
   - echo in the AM
   - consider EP consult in the AM and possible EPS once hemodynamically
   stable and has completed the arctic sun protocol
   - continue cooling protocol via Arctic Sun
   - replete electrolytes aggressively
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   2. Leukocytosis
   Etiology of his leukocytosis is most likely related to his Vfib arrest,
   although infection is also possible. Only localizing symptom at this
   time includes his UA that is suggestive of UTI, although no leuks or
   nitrates despite > 50 WBCs and bacteria.
   - resend UA and culture, treat with cipro if positive
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - follow-up CXR read
   3. Morbid Obesity
   Patient has morbid obesity and is currently undergoing outpatient
   evaluation for gastric bypass.
   - continue outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass procedure
   4. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest. Patient is on
   room air at baseline but does have a history of asthma and obstructive
   sleep apnea. No additional evidence of pneumonia or additional
   respiratory incident. ABG on current settings demonstrates adequate
   oxygenation but likely respiratory acidosis given slightly elevated
   PCO2.
   - continue to maintain intubation and sedation for adequate cooling
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Follow and replete electrolytes. NPO for now. IVF bolus to
   maintain MAP > 65

 [**2165-4-8**]
 Preliminary evaluation
 RV dysfunction
   Assessment and Plan
   36yo male with morbid obesity was admitted s/p cardiac arrest at home.
   1. s/p Arrest
   Etiology of his arrest is unclear and will be very difficult to assess
   given that he was unmonitored at the time of the event. Differential
   diagnosis includes pulmonary embolus given intraventricular conduction
   delay in lead V1, tachycardia, and hypoxia. Preliminary evaluation of
   echo appears to demonstrate RV dysfunction which would also be
   consistent for pulmonary embolus. Additional differential diagnosis
   includes ischemia, structural heart disease, and arrhythmia, although
   patient has no prior history of any of these abnormalities. An
   additional possibility includes a non-cardiac cause of hemodynamic
   instability resulting in a PEA arrest, although patient has no specific
   localizing symptoms or signs.
   - for evaluation of PE, will check CTA chest for evaluation of PE and
   coordinate CT head to evaluate for any intracranial bleed that would
   act as a contraindication to anticoagulation
   - follow-up fasting lipids in the AM
   - consider cardiac catheterization once more hemodynamically stable,
   although this seems less likely given that patient has minimmal other
   risk factors
   - follow-up echo read
   - consider EP consult in the AM and possible EPS once hemodynamically
   stable if no additional cause of VF arrest is found
   - continue cooling protocol via Arctic Sun
   - follow-up EEG and neuro recs per cardiac arrest protocol
   - replete electrolytes aggressively
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   2. Leukocytosis
   Etiology of his leukocytosis is most likely related to his Vfib arrest,
   although infection is also possible. Only localizing symptom at this
   time includes his UA that is suggestive of UTI, although no leuks or
   nitrates despite > 50 WBCs and bacteria.
   - resend UA and culture, treat with cipro if positive
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - follow-up CXR read
   3. Morbid Obesity
   Patient has morbid obesity and is currently undergoing outpatient
   evaluation for gastric bypass.
   - continue outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass procedure pending
   resolution of acute medical concerns
   4. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest. Patient is on
   room air at baseline but does have a history of asthma and obstructive
   sleep apnea. No additional evidence of pneumonia or additional
   respiratory incident. ABG on current settings demonstrates adequate
   oxygenation but likely respiratory acidosis given slightly elevated
   PCO2.
   - continue to maintain intubation and sedation for adequate cooling

   Imaging: ECHO:  The left ventricle is not well seen. Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
   depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
   dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
   determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely represents
   a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is mildly hypokinetic, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not well
   seen but is probably mildly dilated/hypokinetic. No pathologic valvular
   abnormality seen. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
   determined.
   Assessment and Plan
   36yo male with morbid obesity was admitted s/p cardiac arrest at home.
   .
   1. s/p Arrest :  Unclear etiology, Given patient's multiple medical
   problems including sleep apnea, asthma, and morbid obesity, a possible
   etiology of his arrest was arrest in the setting of hypoxia related to
   his obesity-hypoventilation, sleep apnea, and asthma.  Higher on the
   differential is PE given morbid obesity and sedentary lifestyle.
   Additional differential diagnosis includes ischemia, structural heart
   disease, and arrhythmia, although patient has no prior history of any
   of these abnormalities. An additional possibility includes a
   non-cardiac cause of hemodynamic instability resulting in a PEA arrest,
   although patient has no specific localizing symptoms or signs.  ECG
   showed evidence of RSR
 IVCD, consistent with possible PE.  Attempted
   to get a CTA to look for PE yesterday, however based on pts weight it
   was unable to be completed.
   - Artic Sun Cooling protocol with vecuronium
   - Intubated, sedated
   - rule-out MI,
   - check fasting lipids today
   - consider cardiac catheterization once more hemodynamically stable
   - consider EP consult in the AM and possible EPS once hemodynamically
   stable and has completed the arctic sun protocol
   - replete electrolytes aggressively
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   .
   2. Leukocytosis Etiology of his leukocytosis is most likely related to
   his Vfib arrest, although infection is also possible, given evidence of
   UTI on UA.  Trending down.
   - resend UA and culture, treating with cipro
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - follow-up CXR read
   .
   3. Morbid Obesity
   Patient has morbid obesity and is currently undergoing outpatient
   evaluation for gastric bypass.
   - continue outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass procedure
   .
   4. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest. Patient is on
   room air at baseline but does have a history of asthma and obstructive
   sleep apnea. No additional evidence of pneumonia or additional
   respiratory incident. ABG on current settings demonstrates adequate

   Imaging: ECHO:  The left ventricle is not well seen. Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
   depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
   dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
   determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely represents
   a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is mildly hypokinetic, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not well
   seen but is probably mildly dilated/hypokinetic. No pathologic valvular
   abnormality seen. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
   determined.
   Assessment and Plan
   36yo male with morbid obesity was admitted s/p cardiac arrest at home.
   .
   1. s/p Arrest
   Etiology of his arrest is unclear and will be very difficult to assess
   given that he was unmonitored at the time of the event. Given patient's
   multiple medical problems including sleep apnea, asthma, and morbid
   obesity, a likely etiology of his arrest is arrest in the setting of
   hypoxia related to his obesity-hypoventilation, sleep apnea, and
   asthma. Additional differential diagnosis includes ischemia, structural
   heart disease, and arrhythmia, although patient has no prior history of
   any of these abnormalities. An additional possibility includes a
   non-cardiac cause of hemodynamic instability resulting in a PEA arrest,
   although patient has no specific localizing symptoms or signs.
   - ECG upon arrival to the floor
   - rule-out MI
   - check fasting lipids in the AM
   - consider cardiac catheterization once more hemodynamically stable
   - echo in the AM
   - consider EP consult in the AM and possible EPS once hemodynamically
   stable and has completed the arctic sun protocol
   - continue cooling protocol via Arctic Sun
   - replete electrolytes aggressively
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   .
   2. Leukocytosis
   Etiology of his leukocytosis is most likely related to his Vfib arrest,
   although infection is also possible. Only localizing symptom at this
   time includes his UA that is suggestive of UTI, although no leuks or
   nitrates despite > 50 WBCs and bacteria.
   - resend UA and culture, treat with cipro if positive
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - follow-up CXR read
   .
   3. Morbid Obesity
   Patient has morbid obesity and is currently undergoing outpatient
   evaluation for gastric bypass.
   - continue outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass procedure
   .
   4. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest. Patient is on
   room air at baseline but does have a history of asthma and obstructive
   sleep apnea. No additional evidence of pneumonia or additional
   respiratory incident. ABG on current settings demonstrates adequate
   oxygenation but likely respiratory acidosis given slightly elevated
   PCO2.
   - continue to maintain intubation and sedation for adequate cooling

"1112",2081,80134,"Chief Complaint:  s/p cardiac arrest
   HPI: 36yo male with medical history notable for morbid obesity was
   admmitted from the ED s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   Patient was found by his family having tonic clonic movements and
   unresponsive. EMS was called and patient was found to be in Vfib
   arrest. He was initially cardioverted at 200J and rhythm converted to
   asystole. He received epi, atropine, narcan, and 100mg lidocaine for
   recurrent VF. He was defibrillated again with conversion to sinus
   tachycardia. He was intubated and started on a lidocaine drip.
   Hypothermia cooling protocol was initiated at that time and taken to an
   OSH. At the OSH, vital signs on arrival were BP 111/66, HR 98, RR 23,
   temp 98.5, and O2 sat 96% on vent. He was administered midazolam 8mg
   total, ativan 2mg IV x 2, lopressor 5mg IV x 1, and 1L normal saline
   bolus. The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]. Upon arrival at
   [**Hospital1 19**], vital signs were temp 37.9, HR 142 / BP 139/50, RR 48, and O2
   sat 97% on vent (unclear what the settings were). He was switched to
   propofol boluses for sedation. He was started on the arctic sun
   protocol and transferred to the floor. He required vecuronium x 1.
   .
   Patient is intubated and sedated and full review of systems could not
   be obtained.  In discussion with his wife, patient was dizzy one day
   ago when he bent over to pick up something. On this day of admission,
   patient was in his usual state of health. He and his wife went [**Name2 (NI) 6625**]
   without any complications. She heard a noise in their bedroom and found
   that he had whole body shaking, eyes rolling back into his head. She
   called 911 and then went with him. She thinks he was breathing but
   unsure if he had a pulse.

 Preliminary evaluation
 RV dysfunction
   Assessment and Plan
   36yo male with morbid obesity was admitted s/p cardiac arrest at home.
   1. s/p Arrest
   Etiology of his arrest is unclear and will be very difficult to assess
   given that he was unmonitored at the time of the event. Differential
   diagnosis includes pulmonary embolus given intraventricular conduction
   delay in lead V1, tachycardia, and hypoxia. Preliminary evaluation of
   echo appears to demonstrate RV dysfunction which would also be
   consistent for pulmonary embolus. Additional differential diagnosis
   includes ischemia, structural heart disease, and arrhythmia, although
   patient has no prior history of any of these abnormalities. An
   additional possibility includes a non-cardiac cause of hemodynamic
   instability resulting in a PEA arrest, although patient has no specific
   localizing symptoms or signs.
   - for evaluation of PE, will check CTA chest for evaluation of PE and
   coordinate CT head to evaluate for any intracranial bleed that would
   act as a contraindication to anticoagulation
   - follow-up fasting lipids in the AM
   - consider cardiac catheterization once more hemodynamically stable,
   although this seems less likely given that patient has minimmal other
   risk factors
   - follow-up echo read
   - consider EP consult in the AM and possible EPS once hemodynamically
   stable if no additional cause of VF arrest is found
   - continue cooling protocol via Arctic Sun
   - follow-up EEG and neuro recs per cardiac arrest protocol
   - replete electrolytes aggressively
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   2. Leukocytosis
   Etiology of his leukocytosis is most likely related to his Vfib arrest,
   although infection is also possible. Only localizing symptom at this
   time includes his UA that is suggestive of UTI, although no leuks or
   nitrates despite > 50 WBCs and bacteria.
   - resend UA and culture, treat with cipro if positive
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - follow-up CXR read
   3. Morbid Obesity
   Patient has morbid obesity and is currently undergoing outpatient
   evaluation for gastric bypass.
   - continue outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass procedure pending
   resolution of acute medical concerns
   4. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest. Patient is on
   room air at baseline but does have a history of asthma and obstructive
   sleep apnea. No additional evidence of pneumonia or additional
   respiratory incident. ABG on current settings demonstrates adequate
   oxygenation but likely respiratory acidosis given slightly elevated
   PCO2.
   - continue to maintain intubation and sedation for adequate cooling

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 399**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health care proxy. I have discussed
   this plan with Dr(s). CCU team.
   DNR status discussed. Full code.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Impression:  cardiopulmonary arrest in a 36-year old man with obesity
   and sleep apnea.  Diagnostic considerations are broad, but high on the
   list is pulmonary embolism and primary cardiac arrhythmia.  ACS is less
   likely given ECG, but is possible. Primary respiratory arrest is also a
   consideration.  Finally, this could have been a primary neurologic
   event given ?seizure, though the latter could have just been secondary
   to hypoxemia.
   Plan:
   1. Cooling protocol in progress
   2. Will interrupt #1 briefly to obtain head CT scan (r/o CNS bleed,
   structural brain abnormality, etc.)
   3. CTA chest to r/o PE
   4. Will decide on IV heparin after #2 and #3
   5. Echocardiogram to assess RV function in the meantime
   6. Repeat U/A
   7. Continuous EEG to r/o status epilepticus

   Clinician:  Attending
   We attempted to perform head and chest CT scans today (see note above),
   but the patient is too large to fit on the scanner.  At this time, he
   is hemodynamically stable (mildly bradycardic [**2-11**] cooling), but his A-a
   gradient is very large and he is not ventilating well.
   At this time, I think that PE is much higher on the differential of his
   arrest than any structural brain abnormality.  I believe that he would
   be best served with IV infusion of heparin to treat presumed PE.  There
   is a small chance of intracranial hemorrhage with IV heparin if he has
   an underlying structural abnormality, but I don't think that's likely.
   I spoke to his [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Name (NI) 6659**] (?sp), who is his HCP and made her aware
   of the situation and the risks.  She agreed that we should go forward
   with blood thinners ""based on what we believe is going on"".  She is
   aware of the potential risks.
   Total time spent:  60 minutes
   Patient is critically ill.

   Cardiac arrest
   Assessment:
   s/p VFib arrest @ home requiring multiple shocks/CPR/meds prior to
   return to ST in the field. After difficult extrication from patient
   apartment was brought to OSH prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 19**] ED for cooling
   protocol on Arctic Sun. Difficult to cool (? [**2-11**] large body mass). Per
   CCU attending note- etiology potentially PE/primary cardiac arrhythmia/
   less likely ACS/also primary respiratory arrest or neurological event
   such as seizure leading to hypoxemia.
   BP stable via Aline 90s-120
s / 60s-70s. HR initially 60
s at start of
   shift, now low 40
s (HR slowing as patient cooling). All extremities
   cold to touch/pulses by Doppler. Generalized edema, notable in hands
   and LE
s. Required boluses and eventually vecuronium gtt to prevent
   shivering.
   Action:
   Attempting to cool patient to goal 34 celcius. Cooling interrupted
   briefly for transport to CT. Re-started at 130 pm. Difficulty obtaining
   goal temp- additionally applied ice packs to patient groin and axilla.

"1118",2081,80134,"Chief Complaint:  s/p cardiac arrest
   HPI: 36yo male with medical history notable for morbid obesity was
   admitted from the ED s/p cardiac arrest.
   Patient was found by his family having tonic-clonic movements and
   unresponsive. EMS was called and patient was found to be in Vfib
   arrest. He was initially cardioverted at 200J, and rhythm converted to
   asystole. He received epi, atropine, narcan, and 100mg lidocaine for
   recurrent VF. He was defibrillated again with conversion to sinus
   tachycardia. He was intubated and started on a lidocaine drip.
   Hypothermia cooling protocol was initiated at that time, and he was
   taken to an OSH. At the OSH, vital signs on arrival were BP 111/66, HR
   98, RR 23, temp 98.5, and O2 sat 96% on vent (unclear settings at the
   time). He was administered midazolam 8mg total, ativan 2mg IV x 2,
   lopressor 5mg IV x 1, and 1L normal saline bolus. The patient was then
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]. Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 19**], vital signs were temp
   37.9, HR 142 / BP 139/50, RR 48, and O2 sat 97% on vent (unclear what
   the settings were). He was switched to propofol boluses for sedation.
   He was started on the arctic sun protocol and transferred to the floor.
   He required vecuronium x 1 for paralysis.
   Patient is intubated and sedated and full review of systems could not
   be obtained.  In discussion with his wife, patient was dizzy one day
   ago when he bent over to pick up something. On this day of admission,
   patient was in his usual state of health. He and his wife went [**Name2 (NI) 6625**]
   without any complications. On the evening of admission, she heard a
   noise in their bedroom and found that he had whole body shaking, eyes
   rolling back into his head. She called 911. She thinks he was breathing
   but unsure if he had a pulse.

   Assessment and Plan
   36yo male with morbid obesity was admitted s/p cardiac arrest at home.
   1. s/p Arrest
   Etiology of his arrest is unclear and will be very difficult to assess
   given that he was unmonitored at the time of the event. Given patient's
   multiple medical problems including sleep apnea, asthma, and morbid
   obesity, a likely etiology of his arrest is arrest in the setting of
   hypoxia related to his obesity-hypoventilation, sleep apnea, and
   asthma. Additional differential diagnosis includes ischemia, structural
   heart disease, and arrhythmia, although patient has no prior history of
   any of these abnormalities. An additional possibility includes a
   non-cardiac cause of hemodynamic instability resulting in a PEA arrest,
   although patient has no specific localizing symptoms or signs.
   - ECG upon arrival to the floor
   - rule-out MI
   - check fasting lipids in the AM
   - consider cardiac catheterization once more hemodynamically stable
   - echo in the AM
   - consider EP consult in the AM and possible EPS once hemodynamically
   stable and has completed the arctic sun protocol
   - continue cooling protocol via Arctic Sun
   - replete electrolytes aggressively
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   2. Leukocytosis
   Etiology of his leukocytosis is most likely related to his Vfib arrest,
   although infection is also possible. Only localizing symptom at this
   time includes his UA that is suggestive of UTI, although no leuks or
   nitrates despite > 50 WBCs and bacteria.
   - resend UA and culture, treat with cipro if positive
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - follow-up CXR read
   3. Morbid Obesity
   Patient has morbid obesity and is currently undergoing outpatient
   evaluation for gastric bypass.
   - continue outpatient evaluation for gastric bypass procedure
   4. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest. Patient is on
   room air at baseline but does have a history of asthma and obstructive
   sleep apnea. No additional evidence of pneumonia or additional
   respiratory incident. ABG on current settings demonstrates adequate
   oxygenation but likely respiratory acidosis given slightly elevated
   PCO2.
   - continue to maintain intubation and sedation for adequate cooling
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Follow and replete electrolytes. NPO for now. IVF bolus to
   maintain MAP > 65

   Cardiology Fellow Addendum
   Pt seen and examined, agree with above.
   Briefly, pt is 36 yo morbidly obese man with asthma and OSA who was
   found unresponsive by family in chair with ?tonic-clonic movements.
   History is mostly through ED staff and report. No EMS strips or report
   available. When EMS arrived they found him without pulse and in VF. He
   was shocked a total of 3 times, rec
d epi and then atropine. Converted
   to NSR with pulse. Intubated. Initally went to an OSH who started
   lidocaine. On transfer, patient was hemodynamically stable, never
   needing pressors. No known cardiac history.  In CCU patient had lower
   blood pressures that responded to IVF. Cooling protocol initiated in
   ED, however due to patient
s size, unclear how effective.

   A/P 36 yo morbidly obese man with asthma and OSH who was found to have
   VF arrest, now in NSR
   1.       VF arrest: Unclear if VF was initial rhythm and unclear how
   long patient was down. Possible that he had hypoxia from OSA and then
   vf. No changes on ECG to suggest acute infarct and CE pattern likely
   [**2-11**] shocks. For now, would d/c lidocaine. Continue cooling protocol.
   Will likely need cath to r/o CAD however given weight will be
   challenging.  Check echo in am. [**Month (only) 51**] need EP evaluation  prior to
   discharge re: ICD for secondary prevention.
   2.       Hypotension: Was transient and responded to IVF. Will pan
   culture  to e/f infection and cover with one dose prophylaxis. Cont IVF
   and follow UO.

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Lead extraction status post cardiac arrest.

 Comparison is made with prior study performed 30 minutes earlier.

 Endotracheal tube is in standard position.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
 There is no pneumothorax.  If any, there is a small left pleural effusion,
 unchanged.  There is a new linear atelectasis in the right mid lung.  Mild
 pulmonary edema is stable.  Perihilar opacities on the right are unchanged.
 Perihilar opacities on the left have improved.  This could be due to the
 pulmonary edema, but aspiration cannot be totally excluded and continued
 attention in this area is recommended.  There are no new lung abnormalities.

 HISTORY:  52-year-old male with cardiac arrest, intubated, check position of
 the endotracheal tube.

 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable AP chest radiograph submitted for review, no prior
 study is available for comparison.

 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in situ with its tip approximately 2.5 cm
 from the carina.  An NG tube is in situ, the tip of which is not visualized
 but lies below the diaphragm.  Even allowing for the projection, the heart is
 diffusely enlarged.  The lungs are grossly clear.

 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary edema,
 adequate placement of the endotracheal tube.

"1121",2091,80844,"Pt transferred from an OSH in Afib with RVR that converted to NSR on a
   dilt gtt overnight. Pt on multiple meds->digoxin, beta blocker,
   diltiazem, dofetilide but continued in afib with RVR. On floor here at
   [**Hospital1 **], pt on a diltiazem gtt->converted to NSR overnight. Pt sent to EP
   lab for PVI.  Reportedly, during the procedure patient BP dropped with
   SBP 64 after trans-septal and TTE showed pericardial effusion.
   Pericardial drain was placed - 1300mL drained, pt had been intubated
   pre-procedure. Given 1unit  PRBCs and protamine to reverse the heparin
   as well  and started on 5 mcg Dopa prior to transfer to CCU. Plan for
   CCU to wean pressor/Vent support as able and continue to closely
   monitor for possible tamponade/worsening hemodynamics.
   Acidosis, Mixed
   Assessment:
   Pt w history COPD/HTN/CHF admitted to  CCU s/p attempt at PVI/ablation
   on vent support/pressor- continued with acidosis by ABG.
   Action:
   Pt initially on 10 PS/5 PEEP with ph- 7.25 and only fair TV. Increased
   PS to 15 with better pH but remains acidosis. Multiple ABG
s not
   significantly improved. Pt looking stressed/working harder with less
   pressure support on board.
   Response:
   PT remains acidotic with multiple vent changes- unable to wean off vent
   support tonite. CXR revealing no acute pulmonary process.
   Plan:
   Continue on PS 15/ rest overnite as needed on AC support. Readdress
   goal of extubation once pt more stable in AM.
   Ventricular tachycardia, sustained
   Assessment:
   Pt s/p attempt at PVI c/b perforation/pericardial effusion developing
   sustained VT after increase in frequency over course of the evening.

   Action:
   Code called, pt resuscitated with shock x 4, med boluses ,CPR,
   amiodorone gtt. See code sheet. Stat repeat ECHO revealing no increase
   in pericardial effusion.
   Response:
   Pt returning to SR/accelerated junctional rhythym with adequate BP on
   Levo gtt- Dopa d/c. Remains out of VT currently on Amio gtt. Given Mg/K
   replacement as needed/ordered.
   Plan:
   Continue to closely monitor- if repeat VT
 lido bolus/gtt. Repeat EKG
   in AM along with lytes/labs. Continue on pressor /antiarrythmics as
   ordered.
   Pericardial effusion (without tamponade)
   Assessment:
   Pt admitted to CCU s/p failed PVI attempt c/b pericardial
   eff/perforation. Remains with pericardial drain in place, no increase
   in effusion noted by ECHO nor increase in drainage from drain.
   Action:
   Checked aspiration q 4 hours this shift- 2-3 cc and 12 cc once. 100 cc
   total from 7p to 4am currently passively draining- ? possibly after
   CPR/code. No flushing of catheter currently as able to aspirate this
   shift.
   Hemodynamics unstable- requiring increase/decrease of pressors

 The study has just come to attention leading to delay in reporting.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cardiac arrest and TandemHeart, with desaturation; evaluate
 catheter placement

 COMPARISON:  CXR [**2124-12-6**] at 12:43 a.m. and 8:21 a.m.

 FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior study, there is now complete opacification of
 the left lung suggesting collapse, possibly due to mucus plugging given the
 short time interval.  Increased perihilar consolidation in the right lung is
 moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.  The endotracheal tube is 4.2 cm above the
 carina.  The nasogastric tube follows a normal course.  The TandemHeart
 catheter continues to project over the region of the tricuspid valve,
 unchanged in position.  A right PICC projects over the mid SVC.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes cannot be assessed due to lung collapse.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left lung collapse.
 2.  Moderate-to-severe right pulmonary edema, increased from 8:21 a.m.

 Given that report is delayed and subsequent radiographs show improvement, no
 call was made at the time of interpretation.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12424**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with a history of moderate aortic
   stenosis (1-1.2 cm2), aortic regurg, first-degree AV block, recent
   DVT/PE on coumadin (diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**]), HTN, CKD, and left BKA who is
   transferred from [**Hospital1 5**]-[**Location (un) 3**] for management of third degree av block.
   .
   # Complete heart block:  Unclear etiology, may be related to coronary
   ischemia though does not carry diagnosis of CAD, not on beta blockers
   or calcium channel blockers at baseline, no evidence of myocarditis.
   Electrolytes not significantly abnormal to suggest cause.
   - continue transvenous pacing
   - EP consult for PPM
   - check cardiac enzymes
   - EKG on arrival
   - check tsh, spep/upep
   - ECHO to eval for cardiomyopathy
   .
   # Hypotension:  Was hypertensive on arrival to OSH and levophed
   initiated in setting of intubation and propofol.  DDx includes propofol
   effect, bradycardia, hypovolemia; would also consider pericardial
   tamponade given pacer wire placement. Sepsis and PE less likely.  Has
   stable aortic stenosis.
   - IVF bolus on arrival
   - weane pressors as tolerated
   - consider changing sedation to fent/midazolam
   - check ECHO
   - blood, urine, sputum cultures
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for airway protection in setting of
   bradycardia and asytole.  Likely aspirated given gastric contents from
   ETT so may have also developed pneumonitis/pneumonia.
   - ABG and CXR on arrival
   - continue current vent settings
   - sputum cultures
   - hold on antibiotics for now
   .
   # Recent DVT/likely PE:  Diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**] with DVT in left lower
   extremity, also with probable PE on v/q scan.
   - hold coumadin for now given likely EP procedure
   - low dose vitamin k
   - monitor respiratory status
   .
   #  Chronic kidney disease:  Baseline creatinine 1.8.
   - mucomyst and bicarb IVFs prior to procedure
   .
   # Tophaceous gout: On chronic steroids, allopurinol, colchicine
   - continue prednisone at current dose
   - continue allopurinol
   - will hold colchicine pending creatinine check

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12424**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with a history of moderate aortic
   stenosis (1-1.2 cm2), aortic regurg, first-degree AV block, recent
   DVT/PE on coumadin (diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**]), HTN, CKD, and left BKA who is
   transferred from [**Hospital1 5**]-[**Location (un) 3**] for management of third degree av block.
   .
   # Complete heart block:  Unclear etiology, may be related to coronary
   ischemia though does not carry diagnosis of CAD, not on beta blockers
   or calcium channel blockers at baseline, no evidence of myocarditis.
   Electrolytes not significantly abnormal to suggest cause.
   - continue transvenous pacing
   - EP consult for PPM
   - check cardiac enzymes
   - EKG on arrival
   - check tsh, spep/upep
   - ECHO to eval for cardiomyopathy
   .
   # Hypotension:  Was hypertensive on arrival to OSH and levophed
   initiated in setting of intubation and propofol.  DDx includes propofol
   effect, bradycardia, hypovolemia; would also consider pericardial
   tamponade given pacer wire placement. Sepsis and PE less likely.  Has
   stable aortic stenosis.
   - IVF bolus on arrival
   - weane pressors as tolerated
   - consider changing sedation to fent/midazolam
   - check ECHO
   - blood, urine, sputum cultures
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for airway protection in setting of
   bradycardia and asytole.  Likely aspirated given gastric contents from
   ETT so may have also developed pneumonitis/pneumonia.
   - ABG and CXR on arrival
   - continue current vent settings
   - sputum cultures
   - hold on antibiotics for now
   .
   # Recent DVT/likely PE:  Diagnosed ~[**2181-4-24**] with DVT in left lower
   extremity, also with probable PE on v/q scan.
   - hold coumadin for now given likely EP procedure
   - low dose vitamin k
   - monitor respiratory status
   .
   #  Chronic kidney disease:  Baseline creatinine 1.8.
   - mucomyst and bicarb IVFs prior to procedure
   .
   # Tophaceous gout: On chronic steroids, allopurinol, colchicine

"1129",2130,84388,"81yof with PMH: severe 3VD including 70% ostial LM, unsuccessful PCI in
   the past, CHF, CRI, PVD, IDDM had a recent admit to OSH 2weeks ago for
   CHF exacerbation, abdominal and right leg pains discharged home after 4
   days with increased lasix dose. .  Presents to OSH [**2-10**] 1500 for
   SSCP/epigastric pressure with ST depressions and peaked TW +trop 3.0,
   started heparin gtt and dopamine gtt for hypotension SBP 70, received
   dilaudid IVB before transfer to [**Hospital1 5**]/EW. Arrived with SBP 90 with
   dopamine gtt at 10mcg/kg/min. EKG with STD laterally +trop 1.5. Pt was
   admitted to CCU at 0500 on Heparin at 1000u/hr, dopamine at
   10mcg/kg/min with SBP 96 HR 135. She received 1 liter NS and dopamine
   was shut off with decrease in HR from 130s to 90s NSR. PT reported
   chest discomfort as minimal.She was bloused with and started on
   integrellin shortly after admission.  BUN/Creat elevated at 91/1.8 with
   K+ 5.5. She reports loss of apatite and that she has not eaten or drunk
   liquids for the past 2 days. She finally ate some oatmeal and has been
   drinking water in the afternoon. . After talking with patient and her
   daughter, who is the proxy she is DNI, but is to received shocks, CPR
   and meds. She is oriented X 3 and although she appears to understand
   most of what is said to her, her accent is strong and she is difficult
   to understand. Her daughter spoke to her on the phone. Her skin is
   without lesions.
   Hypotension (not Shock)
   Assessment:
   Pt received 1 liter NS after arriving in CCU as dopamine was stopped.
   She had more stable bp until ~0730 when she became hypotensive to the
   70s with maps in the mid 40s. She reported unchanged minor chest
   pressure and was not sure about that. HR was in mid 90s to low 100s.
   Lungs are clear and she was sating 100% on 2L NP. She felt thirsty and
   mucous membranes appeared dry. She had been on increased dose of lasix
   after recent admission for CHF.
   Action:
   She received 3 more 500 NS bolues for at total of 2500cc and NS
   started at 200cc/hr. Phenylephrine was started at 0800 at .5mic/kilo as
   first 1st bolus was running. Neo was shut off at 0920 as more fluid was
   given, however it had to be restarted at 1030 for maps in the 40s. NS
   continues at 200cc/hr. She was cultured. ECHO done to ascertain if she
   has had change in cardiac function with troponin bump.
   Response:
   BP has been stable on neo with U/O 10-50cc/hr. She was started on ABX.
   Echo showed EF of ~20% (45%), with moderate MR. She also had pulmonary
   hypertension with PA pressure ~50. Maps have been above 65 since back
   on neo. Fluid continues at 200cc/hr. She will have had 4 liters in
   since 5am once this liter finishes. She should be watched closely as
   she has low EF and hx of heart failure. Of note neo is running through
   a peripheral line. She is being evaluated for a picc. Neo being weaned
   as PTT too high now for PICC and baseline bp 70-100s.  Thus far
   tolerating wean.
   Plan:
   Try to get neo off. Continue to assess for signs of fluid overload.
   Central sleep apnea (CSA)
   Assessment:
   Pt noted to have long apnic periods followed by hyperventilation which
   awakens her. Sats do not drop, even on RA. She frequently moans as she
   awakens with hyperventilatory respirations and appears very short of
   breath and uncomfortable.  Pt feeling very weak and exhausted as she is
   unable to sleep. She reports she felt like this at home.
   Action:
   Blood gas drawn to ensure she was not retaining CO2. Gas was
   7.39/33/100/ -3/ 21. Although pt does not de-sat she doesn
t sleep and
   c-pap will be tried to see if it helps her.
   Response:
   Will have resp attempt c-pap tonight,
   Plan:
   Support and monitor pt. Try c-pap later.
   Myocardial infarction, acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   Assessment:
   Pt CKs continue to climb. In EW they were 368/45/12.2 and at 11am they
   were 792/98/12.4. She states she has minor epigastric discomfort, but
   it has been persistent and has not changed since admission here. Blood
   pressure too low to given beta-blockers or nitrates. She is on heparin
   and was started on integrellin after arrving in CCU.
   Action:
   Team notified. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 876**] feels cath not valuable as pt has such
   significant known multivessel disease not treatable with intervention,
   and she is not a surgical candidate.  Integrellin was stopped at 0830
   and heparin continues at 1000 units/hr. PTT >150 and heparin off from
   1800 to 1900. Will be started at 700u/hr.
   Response:
   No further CKs ordered as it will not change treatment.  Restart
   heparin per ss.
   Plan:
   Check PTT in 6hr. Monitor for further pain.

   The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen
   by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is
   10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. No masses or thrombi are seen
   in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) with global hypokinesis and
   inferior/infero-lateral akinesis. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
   function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
   regurgitation.] There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
   aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-12-14**], overall
   LVEF has decreased.
   Assessment and Plan

   proximal, RCA 100% ostial disease, no stent) DM2, HTN, HL, who
   originally presented to OSH w epigastric pain, was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**]
   w elevated cardiac enzymes and hypotension, and was found to have a UTI
   causing demand ischemia.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: likely [**2-23**] vasodilation from UTI and hypovolemia from
   decreased PO intake. Minimally responsive to fluids (received 4-5 L of
   NS yesterday). Pt refused central line for pressure monitoring.
   - on phenylephrine gtt at 0.3mcg/kg/min (wean as tolerated)
   - bolus w 500cc NS as needed
   - monitor BP (goal MAP > 65)
   - treat UTI w Bactrim
   .
   # UTI: UA on [**2-11**] w >1000 WBC, many bacteria, large LE; urine culture
   pending. Bactrim 14-day course started on [**2-11**] w a one-time dose of
   gentamycin for synergy. Afebrile.
   - f/u urine culture
   - continue Bactrim SS 1 tab PO BID (day 2 of 14)
   .
   # CORONARIES: Severe 3vCAD, not a candidate for PCI or CABG.
   Dehydration, as suggested on exam, might have lead to hypoperfusion of
   coronary arteries, worsening CAD and causing chest pain.
   - continue heparin, aspirin, clopidogrel, statin
   - telemetry
   .
   # PUMP: No sign of heart failure on exam. Evidence of hypovolemia on
   exam. Extremities are warm, making cardiogenic shock unlikely.
   - bolus with NS as needed
   - wean off dopamine; consider phenylephrine if needs a pressor
   - monitor I/O closely
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus tachycardia.
   - wean off dopamine

   As mentioned in Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s note and the housestaff note Ms [**Known lastname 4160**] is
   an 81F with h/o CAD with inoperable and non-interveneable coronary
   artery disease who presents with epigastric pain and hypotension
   non-responsive to fluids.  She in addition has a troponin T elevation
   to 1.5 initially and later to 3.5.  During the day she continues to be
   hypotensive despite further fluid resuscitation and low dose
   neosynephrine.  On exam she does not seem to be volume overloaded nor
   has features of cardiogenic shock (warm clammy skin, warm shins and
   extremities).  The hypotension most likely is secondary to a
   distributive shock with UTI as a source.  The cardiac enzyme elevation
   despite its extent is due to hypotension in the setting of urosepsis
   and represents a type II myocardial infarction, which we are treating
   conservatively and if there is any platelet activation with ASA,
   clopidogrel and heparin.
   Access has been a problem in her and we wanted to place a central line
   in her to monitor her CVP for goal directed therapy.  However, she has
   recently had a bad experience of line placement and is mortified to
   have a central line placed.  We are currently trying to get the PICC
   team to place a line in order to avoid IJ or subclavian canulation.  In
   case this is not successful I spoke to the family in regards of further
   plans.  Ms [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 359**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4166**] is her daughter and HCP.  We agreed to try
   placing a PICC line and if this does not work to continue the therapy
   as is suboptimally with peripheral iv therapy and pressor infusion but
   avoidance of a central line.  If she happens to worsen her clinical
   status we would not augment clinical efforts and change our focus on
   comfort only.
   Her code status at present is DNI with resuscitation efforts in case of
   a cardiac arrest in the realm of the limitation to not being able to be
   intubated.

 HISTORY:  70-year-old male with cardiac arrest.

 STUDY:  CT of the head without contrast; coronal and sagittal reformatted
 images were also generated.

 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, midline
 shift, mass effect, or acute large vascular territory infarct. The ventricles
 and sulci are normal in size and configuration.  Calcified atherosclerotic
 disease is seen in the bilateral vertebral arteries as well as the cavernous
 portion of the internal carotid arteries.  The paranasal sinuses demonstrate a
 rounded density in the right maxillary sinus that likely represents a polyp or
 mucus retention cyst (2; 4).  The mastoid air cells are clear.  No acute
 fracture is seen.

 IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage.  Please note that MRI is more
 sensitive for acute ischemia.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 659**] is a 64-year-old man with a history of coronary artery

   running shortly thereafter. He ate poorly, but became good at running.
   He started running with his son in [**2102**]. In [**2104**] he had some exertional

   placement of a bare metal stent in left circumflex. Since that time he
   had been free of symptoms, with his most recent stress test in [**Month (only) 2877**]
   this year not revealing any concerning ischemia, per the patient. He

   previously told him to hold these for two days prior to racing to
   reduce bruising. He got to mile 25 before witnessed callapse, earlier
   increasing shortness of breath and fatigue, followed by loss of
   consciousness. Bystander provided CPR until AED arrived. No strips, but
   AED determined shockable rhythm, likely VF. Sinus rhythm was
   re-established after two shocks and he was brought to [**Hospital1 5**] and
   directly into the cath lab. En route he received 100 mg lidocaine. In
   the ED he was noted to have ST elevation in V3 with biphasic t-waves.
   ST depression was also commented upon there. Code STEMI was called. He
   received Integrillin, IVFs (~ 2L), ASA 325 mg, Plavix (loaded with 600
   mg), vitals were 151/87, HR 86, RR 23, 97% NC. Cardiology was consulted
   and recommended direct transfer to the cath. lab. On coronary
   agiography, LCx stent was appreciated and open, LAD disease was noted ~
   90%. Unlikely STEMI, infact unlikely ACS, but Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4235**] describes as
   likely angina/ischemia with consequent VF and arrest. Possible that
   ischemic changes on EKG are secondary to demand and shocks. A long
   stent drug-eluting stent was placed in the LAD. He received 20 mg IV
   Lasix. EKG had partly normalized after cath.
   .
   On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep
   venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
   myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
   He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock
   pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
   .
   Cardiac review of systems is notable for (+) shortness of breath,
   fatigue and notable for the absence of (-) chest pain, paroxysmal
   nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
   presyncope.

"1155",2165,87646,"Pt is a 64yo male w/ hx of CAD, stent to Lcx in 07'. Running the [**Location (un) **]
   marathon w/ son when suddenly collapsed w/ LOC. Son & bystander did
   CPR. EMS arrived & AED shocked pt x2 for VT. Converted to SR, sent to
   [**Hospital1 **] EW-started on ACS/STEMI protocol - then STAT to cath lab.
   In cath- found 90% mid LAD stenosis. Likely had exercise induced
   ischemia that resulted in VF arrest. DES x1 deployed w/ good
   reperfusion. Lcx stent open, no other disease was seen.Given 2 liters
   NS for hydration as well as 20 lasix- admitting Creat 1.5- dropped
   integrillen gtt to 1 mcg/kg for renal concerns. Angioseal used on R fem

   VSS, CP free. Family, friends present, all appear to understand current
   course, procedure performed and plan of care.
   Myocardial infarction, acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   Assessment:
   Pt admitted to CCU for r/I STEMi vs demand ischemia with LAD 90%
   occlusion- opened successfully w DES. PT currently stable
   hemodynamically in CCU.
   Action:
   Close assessment of hemodynamics this shift- continues on integrillen-
   no addition of ACE or B Blocker this shift- VSS- HR- 60
s, SR, no VEA
   and BP- 120-130/60-70. Observation of Rt groin site- D/I with
   transparent dsg in place. Cycling CPK
s= 3^rd set currently pending-
   see flowsheet for CPK curve/trend. PM EKG to also follow trend. Much
   teaching, support for pt and family this shift.
   Response:
   Pt remains hemodynamically stable on current medical regimen s/p
   opening of LAD occlusion w DES.
   Plan:
   Await AM lab results- replete lytes as needed, follow CPK trend- repeat
   at 2pm if has not peaked yet. Continue close observation of groin site,
   pulses, VS. Plan for ECHO today, AM EKG. Reinforce need for pt to call
   staff for any pain, SOB, symptoms similar to what precipitated his CV
   arrest earlier Monday. Continue to freely give fluids in efforts to
   hydrate s/p marathon run yesterday and to keep closer to even(
   currently (-)2500).. Keep family and pt well aware of current plan and
   progress. They are most interested currently in whether/not he had an
   MI vs demand ischemia. c/o to step down once medically appropriate. D/c
   integrillen 915 AM today.
   Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)
   Assessment:
   Pt on prolonged bedrest and s/p CPR/Shock currently w back pain, chest
   wall pain- treated with changing of position, Tylenol, ativan QHS and
   support.
   Action:
   As above- close assessment of pain /anxiety level this shift. Given
   Tylenol and good backrub/changing of position to assist in back
   discomfort. Encouraged to hug pillow and deep breathe to prevent
   atelectasis and ask for more medications if the current Tylenol is not
   working. Encouraged pt to finally take 0.5 ativan at 2:45AM after pt
   stating
 I am afraid to fall asleep
   Response:
   Pt falling asleep, comfortable after above interventions. Family and pt
   appear to understand current course of care and reason for ICU care.
   Turning pt for backrubs but he prefers to sleep on his back.
   Plan:
   Continue to provide comfort and decrease anxiety both w changing of
   position, backrubs, emotional support as well as with medications as
   ordered. MSO4 if Tylenol is not enough to alleviate chest wall pain.
   Call social service to assist w family all of whom are from out of town
   and here for the marathon. Wife needs to check out of current hotel
   this AM and will need assistance to find another hotel for near future.

 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  54-year-old male status post cardiac arrest.  Evaluate for rib
 fracture.

 COMPARISON:  No prior study available for comparison.

 PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Osseous structures are diffusely demineralized,
 limiting evaluation for acute fracture; however, no displaced rib fracture is
 identified.  The cardiac silhouette size is enlarged with a slight globular
 configuration.  There is mild interstitial prominence suggestive of volume
 overload.  The aorta is tortuous, but the mediastinal silhouette is otherwise
 unremarkable.  There is no focal consolidation.  No appreciable pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is noted.

 IMPRESSION:

 1. No displaced rib fracture within limitations above.

 2. Mild volume overload.

 3. Globular enlarged cardiac silhouette.  [**Month (only) **] indicate underlying
 cardiomyopathy or a pericardial effusion.  Correlate clinically.

   Assessment
   This 64-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease likely
   had exercise induced ischemia that resulted in VF and collapse.
   Coronary artery catheterization reveals a long segment of LAD stenosis.
   A drug eluting stent was placed.
   Plan
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Patient likely without ACS, but more likely angina with ischemic
   arhythmia (VF) and collapse. EKG changes not very impressive and more
   likely a consequence of CPR, shocks, strain.
   - No heparin, s/p cath.
   - Integrillin for 18 hours
   - ASA 325 QD, Plavix 75 QD, atorvastatin 80 QD
   - Start ACEI and BB in a.m.
   - EKG on floor (arrival and in a.m.)
   - Echo in a.m.
   - Follow enzymes to test above hypothesis (may have been some
   infarction)
   - Stress test prior to next marathon
   - A1c and lipids in a.m. labs
   # VF - ischemic rhythm

   - revascularization as above
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   Previous noted to be 194, per the patient, but was not taking statin.
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg

   # Lactate
   Likely from marathon (uncertain that this would contribute much) along
   with subsequent arrest and temporary hypoperfusion. Is falling.
   - Trend.
   .
   # Renal Failure
   Likely acute, but do not know baseline creatinine. Patient likely
   dehydrated from run, slightly pre-renal. Will check again in a.m. now
   that he has received IVFs.

   - Atorvastatin 80 mg
   # Lactate
   Likely from marathon (uncertain that this would contribute much) along
   with subsequent arrest and temporary hypoperfusion. Is falling. Fell
   quickly and no suspicion that this would be elevated.
   - No need to trend further
   # Renal Failure
   Resolved
 now normal at 1.0 and likely appropriate for age, muscle
   mass. Reduced from 1.5 yesterday
 likely pre-renal from marathon.
   # Leukocytosis
   Likely stress, corticosteroid, demargination, given events of today.
   # Mental Status
   Some short-term memory difficulty as manifest by repetition of
   questions, worse yesterday than today and away from baseline per
   family. This is improving.

 CHEST CT

 INDICATION:  History of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, admitted with
 cardiac arrest of unknown etiology, to evaluate for acute pathology.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT-acquired axial images and coronal and axial
 images from the clavicle to symphysis pubis displayed with 5-mm slice
 thickness with per oral contrast were reviewed concurrently with coronal and
 sagittal reformatted images. IV contrast was not administered.

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The tracheobronchial tree is patent to the
 subsegmental level.  The tip of the endotracheal tube terminates 2 cm above
 the carina. Patchy, minimal ground-glass opacities in the right upper, middle
 and aerated part of right lower lobe lobe are likely secondary to an
 inflammatory or infectious process, including the possibility of aspiration.

 A 5.7 x 8.5-mm solid noncalcified lung nodule in the left lower lobe (2:31) is
 of unknown chronicity.  Upper lobe predominant centrilobular and paraseptal
 emphysema is mild-to-moderately sever.  Moderate right and minimal left
 non-hemorrhagic, posteriorly layered pleural effusion is associated with
 adjacent lung atelectasis.

 10.7 x 8.4-mm calcified lymph node in the subcarinal region suggestive of
 healed lymph node from prior granulomatous infection.  Cardiomegaly is
 mild-to-moderate and there is no pericardial effusion.  Atherosclerotic
 calcification involving the coronary arteries and aortic arch is moderate to
 severe. Minimal calcification of the aortic valve is of unknown hemodynamic
 significance.  In addition there is moderate calcification of the annulus and
 the ascending aorta.

 CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The liver and spleen are homogeneous in density
 without any demonstrable hypodense lesion.  The gallbladder is distended with
 small 4.8-mm calculus suggestive of cholelithiasis but without any evidence of
 cholecystitis.  There is no intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.  Both
 kidneys are remarkable for multiple exophytic cortical cysts with attenuation
 values suggestive of simple renal cysts.  The largest measures 4.5 x 3.7 cm in
 the left mid pole.  The pancreas is mildly atrophic.  The right adrenal gland

 limb.  Orogastric tube is seen to course with its tip ending in the pylorus of
 the stomach.  Small bowel are normal in caliber.  There is no obstruction or
 inflammation.

 CT PELVIS:  The pelvis is remarkable for distended and redundant rectum and
 sigmoid colon.  The urinary bladder is partially distended.  The prostate and
 seminal vesicles appear normal in morphology.

 Minimal free fluid is seen in the abdomen and pelvis.  The aorta is remarkable
 for severe atherosclerotic calcification extending into both main and branches
 of renal artery.  No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
 Note is made of small left inguinal hernia with intraperitoneal fat as its
 content.

 A catheter through right femoral vein approach is seen to terminate beyond
 origin of external femoral vein.

 BONES:  There is no bone lesion suspicious for malignancy/infection.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Patchy ground-glass opacity in the right upper, middle, and aerated
 portions of the lower lobe, likely due to aspiration and moderate right and
 minimal left pleural effusion with bilateral lower lung atelectasis.

 2.  8 mm non-calcified solid lymph node in the left lung of unknown
 chronicity.  Follow-up CT is again recommended at 3-6 months to assess for the
 stability of the lung nodules.

 3.  Upper lobe predominant mild to moderate emphysema, moderate cardiomegaly
 and severe atherosclerotic coronary calcification.

 4.  Cholelithiasis

 5.  Mild ascites.

 6.  Small left inguinal hernia with intrapertoneal fat as its content
 including trace ascites.

 examination, and may reflect an evolving punctate intraparenchymal or
 subarachnoid hematoma.  No new focus of hemorrhage, mass effect, or large
 vascular territorial infarction is seen.  Moderate prominence of the
 ventricles and sulci, reflective of diffuse cortical atrophy, appear stable.
 There is persistent hypodensity of the periventricular white matter,
 reflecting chronic microvascular ischemic disease.  There is no acute
 fracture.  The paranasal sinuses and left mastoid air cells are clear.
 Post-right mastoidectomy changes are again seen.  Moderate atherosclerotic
 calcifications are seen within the cavernous portions of the internal carotid

 Peripheral ground-glass opacities are most pronounced in right upper and
 middle lobes, some with associated centrilobular nodules.  Focal
 consolidations in bilateral lower lobes are also seen.  No pleural effusion is
 present.  There is no pneumothorax.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN:

 The liver demonstrates homogeneous enhancement without discrete lesions.
 There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal
 dilatation.  The hepatic vasculature is patent.  The liver demonstrates
 decreased attenuation, suggestive of possible fat deposition.  The gallbladder
 is incompletely distended.  There is no gallbladder wall edema or

 (Cont)
 pericholecystic fluid collection to suggest acute inflammation.  There are no
 calcified gallstones within its lumen.  The spleen is unremarkable.  Two
 splenules are incidentally noted.  The pancreas enhances homogeneously without
 ductal dilatation or peripancreatic fluid collection.  The adrenal glands are
 normal. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without
 evidence of hydronephrosis or renal masses.

 Small and large bowel loops are normal in caliber without bowel wall
 thickening or obstruction.  There is no free air or free fluid within the
 abdomen.  The intra-abdominal aorta and its branches are normal in caliber and
 are patent.

 CT OF THE PELVIS:

 Foley catheter is in place.  A locule of gas in the bladder is likely related
 to Foley placement (2:133).  The rectum, seminal vesicles, and sigmoid colon
 are unremarkable.  There is no free air or free fluid within the pelvis.  No
 pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes are seen.  Small
 fat-containing left inguinal hernia is noted (2:139).

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:

 Non-displaced fractures of the right first rib, posterior right fifth through
 seventh ribs, and left anterior second through fourth ribs are noted.  There
 are displaced fractures involving right anterior second through fifth ribs.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right upper and middle lobe ground-glass opacities, most likely
 representing areas of contusion and aspiration. Bilateral lower lobe
 consolidations, which may reflect atelectasis or aspiration.
 2.  Multiple bilateral rib fractures, including displaced right anterior rib
 fractures, likely related to recent CPR.  No pneumothorax.
 3.  Severe coronary artery calcifications.
 4.  Decreased liver attenuation, possibly suggestive of fatty deposition.

   [**Hospital1 5**] after being transferred from [**Hospital1 **], s/p VF arrest at that time.
   The patient says that the site of the pacer never healed after surgery
   he had in [**July 2117**]. He reports that he recently visited his
   Cardiologist in [**Location (un) 1133**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3994**], it was decided that he need
   to undergo surgical repair. The patient has not had any pain at the
   site of the infection. He feels the reddness is stable. He denies
   fevers or chills. He reports that he can visualize the pacer lead and
   that it has been that way for quite some time. He has been on keflex
   TID for at least 1 month. Pt discontinued his coumadin 2 days
   previously as instructed by his cardiologist. He was admitted [**2118-1-27**]
   for IV antibiotics in preparation for lead/pocket revision in OR 1 on
   Monday [**1-31**] at 2pm.

   The patient underwent lead pocket revision on [**1-31**] and had his leads
   and biventricular pacer removed.  While in the PACU his SBP deecreased
   to 70's. Neosinephrine was started and his SBP increased to 110.   His
   neosinephrine was tried to be weaned and his sBP dropped again to
   70's.  A stat echo did not reveal pericardial effusion or tamponade.
   neosinephrine was restarted and his blood pressure increased to 110/70.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH

 INDICATION:  Status post acute myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest.  Line
 placement.

 COMPARISON:  [**2112-6-23**].

 FINDINGS:  The patient is now intubated.  The tip of the tube projects 8 cm
 above the carina.  Newly placed right-sided internal jugular vein central
 venous access, the tip of the line projects over the bottom of the right
 atrium.  No evidence of pneumothorax or other complications.

 While the size of the cardiac silhouette is normal, there is a diffuse partly
 reticular and partly alveolar opacity in the central parts of the lung,
 concentrated around the perihilar regions.  The distribution and aspect of the
 changes suggest centralized pulmonary edema.  The sinuses are not included in
 the image, however, there is no evidence of larger pleural effusions.

 Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Otherwise, the mediastinum appears
 unremarkable.

 progressively worsening somnolence.

 COMPARISON:  NECT, [**2114-1-5**]; MRI, [**2112-8-14**]; cranial CTA, [**2105-11-27**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT imaging of the head was obtained without
 intravenous contrast.  Sagittal and coronal reformations were performed and
 reviewed.

 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass, or
 mass effect.  The [**Doctor Last Name 34**]-white matter differentiation is normal.  The ventricles
 and sulci are mildly enlarged, consistent with global atrophy.  The basal
 cisterns are normal.  Mild vascular calcification is seen in the cavernous
 portion of both internal carotid arteries.  Mild asymmetric prominence of the
 extra-axial CSF space along the left lateral aspect of the posterior fossa is
 unchanged, and likely a small arachnoid cyst.

 The imaged portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
 Incidentally noted are bilateral ocular lens implants.

   Briefly, 55M h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia, MVP presents after sudden cardiac
   arrest.  Patient was working construction, on break, witnessed to
   collapse. CPR started by bystander. Multiple AED shocks, epi, atropine.
   Started on lido drip. Rhythm was VF and PEA intermittently. 40 min
   until spontaneous perfusion restored. Intubated in the field. [**Location (un) **]
   to [**Hospital1 1**] where became hypotensive requiring max dopa and levophed.
   Taken to cath lab which demonstrated minimal coronary disease, normal
   wall motion, CI 8.18, LVEDP 15, and Ao 112/64. Lidocaine stopped and
   cooling protocol begun. Transfer to CCU for further care.
   Past medical, social, family, medications, allergies per CCU housestaff
   note.
   Exam with BP 103/60, HR 111 reg, RR 29, T 94.5, SaO2 94%, AC
   500/26/0.6, intubated and sedated, coarse breath sounds, tachycardic
   without murmurs, no peripheral edema, warm extremities, no withdrawal
   to pain, pupils nonreactive.

   3.9, ABG 7.24/72/38, tox screens neg.
   ECG: sinus tach, probable LAA, low limb volts, Q in III, delayed R-wave
   transition
   CXR: low lung volumes, atelectasis, mild edema.
   CT head: diffuse grey-white matter loss consistent with anoxic brain
   injury
   CTA chest: no dissection, aneurysm, or PE
   Prior studies: normal echo and cath [**2154**], stress test [**2154**] with
   multifocal NSVT
   Impression: Sudden cardiac arrest without significant coronary disease,
   consider primary arrhythmic event. Prolonged resuscitation effort.
   Continue cooling. Shock likely distributive due to arrest, would wean
   dopa/levophed as tolerated for MAP>60, transition to neosynephrine if
   needed. Echo. Neuro consult. Consider EP consult pending neurological
   prognosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o ventricular arrythmia.  Unclear etiology ? if
   metabolic related (ie. Hyperthyroidism) vs infection
   (pulmonary/intra-abdominal)
   - obtain PCP records
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] trend CE (expect elevation because of CPR)
   - TTE to eval EF on [**11-1**]
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - hold lidocaine ggt; if goes back in VF then amiodarone, since no
   ischemic disease.
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest. Currently on cooling protocol.
   - EEG and neurology consultation
   - monitor coags and lytes while cooled
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - wean down pressor (dopa/levo) as tolerated, currently only on
   levophed
   - Consider changing to Neo since this has less B1 ionotropic effect.
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely from tissue ischemia. Lactate was
   elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.
   - treating with HCO3 bolus to prevent acidosis induced VF.
   - continue IVF support, insulin drip, lyte replete.
   - q1h glucose check, with ABG's to see if he is responding to
   treatment.
   - serial ABG check.
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   respiratory alkalosis.
   - monior O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis
   - wean sedation in am as tolerated
   - emperically coverage with zosyn.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cardiac arrest with question of pulmonary embolus.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from same day.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images were acquired through the chest prior to and
 following the administration of intravenous contrast.  Coronal, sagittal and
 oblique reformatted images were also reviewed.

 FINDINGS:  There is no aortic aneurysm or dissection.  The pulmonary arterial
 system is well opacified and there is no evidence of embolic filling defect.
 The lungs are notable for bilateral dependent opacities in the upper and lower
 lobes, likely related to atelectasis or aspiration.  The patient is intubated
 with an endotracheal tube terminating at the origin of the right main stem
 bronchus.  This tube should be retracted.  A nasogastric tube terminates in
 the stomach.  The heart and great vessels are notable for a small amount of
 atherosclerotic coronary arterial calcification.  There is no mediastinal or
 axillary lymphadenopathy.

 Study is not tailored for assessment of subdiaphragmatic contents.
 Nevertheless, those included are notable for a trace amount of perihepatic
 free fluid, a small hiatal hernia as well as fluid and fat stranding adjacent
 to the duodenum, with a possibly thickening wall.

 Included osseous structures reveal no suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesion.
 Incidental note is made of a non-displaced right fourth rib fracture
 anteriorly (3:11).

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No aortic dissection, aortic aneurysm, or pulmonary embolus.
 2.  Bilateral dependent consolidations, either atelectasis or aspiration.
 3.  Endotracheal tube in the right mainstem bronchus, which should be
 retracted.
 4.  Coronary arterial calcification.
 5.  Axial hiatal hernia.
 6.  Trace ascites.
 7.  Stranding and fluid about the second portion of the duodenum, and
 duodenitis is not excluded.

 These findings were discussed in person by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3853**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from the
 emergency department at approximately 5:10 p.m. on [**2158-10-31**].

   HPI:
   Mr [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 8119**] is a 55 year old man with unknown medical history
   who presents to [**Hospital1 1**] after collapsing at work. History was obtained
   through his relatives.
   At 10:20 am on the day of presentation he collapsed while working. A
   co-worker initiated CPR and EMS were called. He was shocked twice at
   the site of collapse with AED and four times more (200J ea) by EMS en
   route to [**Hospital6 **]. He was intubated in the field
   by EMS given respiratory arrest and cyanosis.  During recussitation he
   was also given atropine x4, lidocaine x2 and epinephrine x6. His rhythm
   at this time is reported VF with episodes of PEA and asystole. He
   arrived at [**Location (un) **] at 11:20 and he was started on lidocaine and
   dopanine ggt. He was also given calcium cloride and magnesium sulfate.
   A central venous line was placed in the right groin. He was medflighted
   to [**Hospital1 1**] ED, and arrived here approximately at 1:00 pm. At [**Hospital1 **] he was
   noted to be on sinus tachycardia. No further shocks were administered.
   He was continued on lidocaine ggt but his dopamine was discontinued.
   His blood pressure remained stable on this intervention. A cooling
   protocol was initiated while in the ED.
   In the ED CXR showed mild right hilar fullness. CT head showed changes
   concerning for anoxic injury. While in the ED he developed worsening
   hypotension (radial a line tracing) requring reinitiation and
   uptitration of pressors. He was maxed out on norepinephrine and
   dopamine.
   He was thereafter taken to the cath lab where he was noted to have
   clean coronaries. A preliminary v gram indicated reasonable LV funtion.
   He was also noted to have a CI of 8 and his NE was weaned. Following
   procedure his MAP, transduced from his fem sheath, was in 60s and
   pressors were weaned.
   Apparently he has a history of ""palpitations"" and ""mild heart attack"".
   He's had a cath and a stress test in the past and was told he had a
   ""small"" lesion in his coronaries. He has a brother who passed away from
   a heart attack in his thirties. He is reported to have mitral valve
   prolapse. Over the last several months he has been feeling short of
   breath and fatigued per family. He is currently on lipitor, amlodipine
   and atenolol. He has been followed by a PCP and [**Name Initial (PRE) **] cardiologist and
   records are still pending.

   Assessment and Plan
   In brief this is a 55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. Ischemic
   cardiomyopathy was strogly suspected given patient's reported history.
   However, there was no evidence of CAD on cath and there were no ECG
   changes to suggest MI. Alternatively, left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction may have lead into ventricular arrythmia that evolved into
   VF. A less likely possibility may be myocarditis leading to
   non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (given symptoms of URI over last several
   months).  Long QT syndrome is not supported by ECG findings. Hereditary
   arrythmogenic conditions would be unlikely to manifest for the first
   time this late in life.
   - obtain PCP/Cardiology records
   - trend CE (expect elevation because of CPR)
   - TTE to eval EF
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - hold lidocaine ggt; if goes back in VF then amiodarone, since no
   ischemic disease.
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest. Currently on cooling protocol.
   - EEG and neurology consultation
   - monitor coags and lytes while cooled
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor
   - wean down pressor (dopa/levo) as tolerated.
   - Consider changing to Neo since this has less B1 ionotropic effect.
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   respiratory alkalosis.
   - monior O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis
   - wean sedation in am as tolerated
   # AGMA: likely from tissue ischemia. Lactate elevated but improving.
   - will treat with HCO3 ggt to prevent acidosis induced VF.

 HISTORY:  Cardiac arrest with resuscitation, to evaluate pulmonary status.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**10-31**], the tip of the endotracheal
 tube now is approximately 2.5 cm above the carina.  Low lung volumes persist,
 most likely accounting for the mild prominence of the transverse diameter of
 the heart.  Nasogastric tube extends to the distal stomach.

 Persistent patchy opacification at the right base.  This could represent
 atelectasis, though the possibility of pneumonia would have to be considered
 if there were appropriate clinical findings.

 No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.

 AP PORTABLE CHEST, [**2158-10-31**] AT 13:08 HOURS.

 HISTORY:  Cardiac arrest.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 FINDINGS:  Volumes are markedly diminished with linear atelectasis seen at the
 right lung base and in the bilateral perihilar regions.  There is also mild
 cephalization of flow and interstitial edema as well.  Consistent with the
 given history, an endotracheal tube has been placed with the distal tip
 approximately 1.7 cm from the carina.  A nasogastric tube is in place with the
 side hole slightly cephalad to the gastroesophageal junction.  The mediastinal
 structures are accentuated by the profound low lung volumes.  Otherwise, there
 is mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  The cardiac silhouette is likely
 top normal for size accounting for patient and technical factors.  No effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen on this supine radiograph.  The osseous structures are
 unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:  Markedly low lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding
 and atelectasis at the lung bases.  There is likely mild edema as well.
 Endotracheal tube is slightly low.  Consider retracting approximately 1-2 cm
 for optimal placement.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent cardiac arrest.

 COMPARISON:  None available.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial CT images were acquired through the head in the
 absence of intravenous contrast.

 FINDINGS:  There is diffuse cerebral edema with loss of [**Doctor Last Name 107**]-white matter
 differentiation and diffuse sulcal effacement.  Ventricles are slit-like and
 midline.  Incidental note is made of small calcification at the basal ganglia
 bilaterally.  There is no intracranial hemorrhage.  As yet, there is no
 intracranial herniation.  The included osseous structures reveal no fracture.
 A nasogastric tube traverses the field of view.  A moderate amount of fluid is
 seen dependently in the nasopharynx. Air-fluid levels are also visualized at
 the maxillary sinuses bilaterally, and there is circumferential mucosal
 thickening at the ethmoid air cells bilaterally.

 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse loss of [**Doctor Last Name 107**]-white matter differentiation and sulcal
 effacement consistent with global cerebral edema, likely a sequela of anoxic
 brain injury.

"1199",2249,96305,"Chief Complaint:  cardiac arrest
   HPI:
   Mr [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 8119**] is a 55 year old man with unknown medical history
   who presents to [**Hospital1 1**] after collapsing at work. History was obtained
   through his relatives.
   At 10:20 am on the day of presentation he collapsed while working. A
   co-worker initiated CPR and EMS were called. He was shocked twice at
   the site of collapse with AED and four times more (200J ea) by EMS en
   route to [**Hospital6 **]. He was intubated in the field
   by EMS given respiratory arrest and cyanosis.  During recussitation he
   was also given atropine x4, lidocaine x2 and epinephrine x6. His rhythm
   at this time is reported VF with episodes of PEA and asystole. He
   arrived at [**Location (un) **] at 11:20 and he was started on lidocaine and
   dopanine ggt. He was also given calcium cloride and magnesium sulfate.
   A central venous line was placed in the right groin. He was medflighted
   to [**Hospital1 1**] ED, and arrived here approximately at 1:00 pm. At [**Hospital1 **] he was
   noted to be on sinus tachycardia. No further shocks were administered.
   He was continued on lidocaine ggt but his dopamine was discontinued.
   His blood pressure remained stable on this intervention. A cooling
   protocol was initiated while in the ED.
   In the ED CXR showed mild right hilar fullness. CT head showed changes
   concerning for anoxic injury. While in the ED he developed worsening
   hypotension (radial a line tracing) requring reinitiation and
   uptitration of pressors. He was maxed out on norepinephrine and
   dopamine.
   He was thereafter taken to the cath lab where he was noted to have
   clean coronaries. A preliminary v gram indicated reasonable LV funtion.
   He was also noted to have a CI of 8 and his NE was weaned. Following
   procedure his MAP, transduced from his fem sheath, was in 60s and
   pressors were weaned.
   Apparently he has a history of ""palpitations"" and ""mild heart attack"".
   He's had a cath and a stress test in the past and was told he had a
   ""small"" lesion in his coronaries. He has a brother who passed away from
   a heart attack in his thirties. He is reported to have mitral valve
   prolapse. Over the last several months he has been feeling short of
   breath and fatigued per family. He is currently on lipitor, amlodipine
   and atenolol. He has been followed by a PCP and [**Name Initial (PRE) **] cardiologist and
   records are still pending.

   PND report
   Assessment and Plan
   In brief this is a 55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. Ischemic
   cardiomyopathy was strogly suspected given patient's reported history.
   However, there was no evidence of CAD on cath and there were no ECG
   changes to suggest MI. Alternatively, left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction may have lead into ventricular arrythmia that evolved into
   VF. A less likely possibility may be myocarditis leading to
   non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (given symptoms of URI over last several
   months).  Long QT syndrome is not supported by ECG findings. Hereditary
   arrythmogenic conditions would be unlikely to manifest for the first
   time this late in life.
   - obtain PCP/Cardiology records
   - trend CE (expect elevation because of CPR)
   - TTE to eval EF
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - hold lidocaine ggt; if goes back in VF then amiodarone, since no
   ischemic disease.
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest. Currently on cooling protocol.
   - EEG and neurology consultation
   - monitor coags and lytes while cooled
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor
   - wean down pressor (dopa/levo) as tolerated.
   - Consider changing to Neo since this has less B1 ionotropic effect.
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   respiratory alkalosis.
   - monior O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis
   - wean sedation in am as tolerated
   # AGMA: likely from tissue ischemia. Lactate elevated but improving.
   - will treat with HCO3 ggt to prevent acidosis induced VF.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   55 yr old male with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia and prior cardiac
   eval for ? VT with benign cath had witnessed arrest at work with
   prolonged resuscitation including 2 shocks with AED and 4 by EMS with
   VT, PEA, and asystole.   Cooled.
   Course complicated by hypotension, combined acidosis, hyperglycemia.
   CTA neg.  Cath with no significant CAD and PCW 17.  Echo on pressors
   with normal wall motion.    CI very high at 8.
   Intubated and unreponsive.  Head CT with edema but no bleed.
   Recurrent VF this AM responded to defibrillation.  Amiodarone added.
   CPK 10,775 with positive troponin.
   BP supported with levophed.
   Physical Examination
   Intubated.  Unresponsive.
   No murmurs.
   Ext warm.
   Medical Decision Making
   Amiodarone added.
   Will get prior cardiac evaluation.
   Complete cooling protocol with neuro followup.
   Try to wean off pressors.
   Etiology of arrest not obvious as no evidence of CAD or wall motion
   abnl.
   Total time spent on patient care: 45 minutes of critical care time.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  56-year-old woman with recent PEA arrest and CPR.

 COMPARISON:  None available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images were acquired through the head without contrast.

 FINDINGS:

 There is global loss of the sulci and effacement of the lateral ventricles
 with only the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles visible.  This is
 consistent with global cerebral edema.  No acute large vascular territory
 infarct, shift of midline structure or acute large hemorrhage is present.  The
 paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells show bilateral maxillary mucosal
 thickening.

 IMPRESSION:

 Global cerebral edema.

 NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: In addition to the diffuse swelling described
 above, there appears to be high density in the sulci and cisterns. Although
 the severity  of swelling can create an artifactual appearance of hyperdensity
 in the sulci, the cisternal involvement is convincing. This most likely
 represents subarachnoid hemorrhage, but a severe meningitis could produce
 similar findings.

 The paranasal sinuses demonstrate free fluid in the maxillary and sphenoid
 sinuses and possibly in the ethmoids.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Marked abdominal distention and lower GI bleeding with diffuse
 tenderness in a patient status post recent cardiac arrest.

 COMPARISON:  [**0-0-0**]

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis prior
 to and at multiple phases following the administration of 150 mL of
 intravenous Optiray contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were
 also reviewed.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The imaged portions of the lung bases
 are notable for subsegmental atelectasis as well as smooth intralobular septal
 thickening, and small pleural effusions, likely related to vascular
 resuscitation.  The imaged portion of the cardiac apex is unremarkable.

 The stomach contains a nasogastric tube and is otherwise unremarkable.  The
 duodenum is notable for a duodenal diverticulum.  The spleen and pancreas are
 unremarkable.  The gallbladder is surgically absent.  The kidneys enhance and
 excrete contrast in a symmetric fashion and note is made of bilateral
 hypodensities, too small to characterize though likely cysts.  There is no
 hydronephrosis.  The liver is notable for a few small foci nonspecific
 enhancement (for example, 4B:161), nonspecific in appearance.

 A trace amount of fat stranding is seen surrounding the region of the pylorus
 and duodenum and there are also trace foci of free fluid in the abdomen, in
 particular along both pericolic gutters and dependently in the pelvis.  The
 imaged loops of bowel appear to enhance normally.  There is no mesenteric or
 retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  The mesenteric venous system opacifies
 normally, as does the arterial system.  There is no evidence of embolic
 vascular filling defects.  Note is made of atherosclerosis along the aorta, in
 particular at the origins of the right renal artery, superior mesenteric
 artery, and celiac trunk.  Incidental note is also made of an accessory right
 hepatic artery originating off the SMA.

 CT PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder contains a Foley
                                                             (Over)

 The uterus is normal.  Note is made of a large left adnexal cyst measuring 5.1
 x 3.4 cm.  This cyst was noted on ultrasounds since [**2173**].  A small amount of
 free fluid is present in the pelvis.  There is no pelvic sidewall or inguinal
 lymphadenopathy.  Regional vascular structures opacify normally.  A right
 common femoral central venous catheter is visualized terminating at the level
 of the iliac vein.  There is a small fat-containing right femoral hernia.

 OSSEOUS FINDINGS:  There is no suspicious sclerotic or lytic osseous lesion.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No apparent etiology to abdominal distention or GI bleeding.
 2.  Small amount of stranding and free fluid in the abdomen as well as
 intralobular septal thickening at the lung bases, likely related to volume
 resuscitation.
 3.  Atherosclerotic disease.
 4.  Small areas of hepatic enhancement.  If clinically relevant, would
 recommend comparison to any prior imaging or evaluation via MRI.
 5.  Atherosclerotic disease.
 6.  Large left adnexal cyst, stable as best can be determined.

 SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately
 4.6 cm from the carina.  Nasogastric tube tip terminates within the stomach.
 The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged.  There are diffuse increased
 interstitial markings with cephalization of pulmonary vasculature, compatible
 with mild pulmonary edema.  The left hemithorax and costophrenic angle are
 excluded from the field of view.  Allowing for this, no large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen on the supine AP view.  The aortic knob is calcified
 and the aorta is tortuous.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.

 NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:  There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or
 [**Doctor Last Name 181**]-white matter differentiation abnormality.  The ventricles and extra-axial
 spaces are appropriate for age.  Intracranial carotid artery atherosclerotic
 calcifications are moderate-to-severe.  Mucosal secretions within the nasal
 passages, nasopharynx, and opacification of the ethmoid sinus air cells are
 noted, at least partially related to recent intubation.  There is mucosal
 thickening in bilateral maxillary, frontal,  and sphenoid sinuses, mild in
 degree.  Imaged mastoid air cells are clear. There is no fracture.  Mild
 prominence of the ventricles and cerebral sulci is likely related to
 age-appropriate atrophy.

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post fall and cardiac arrest.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis without
 administration of IV contrast with coronal and sagittal reformats were
 submitted for interpretation.  Please note that IV contrast was not
 administered due to the patient's elevated creatinine.

 FINDINGS:

 CHEST CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  An endotracheal tube with the tip above the carina
 is noted.  An NG tube with the tip at the distal stomach is also noted.  There
 is small amount of substernal hematoma in the anterior mediastinum extending
 down to the level of the diaphragm.  The aorta and pulmonary arteries
 demonstrate normal contour.  Moderate atherosclerotic calcifications of the
 aorta and coronary arteries are noted.  Heart is enlarged.  There is no
 pericardial effusion.  There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
 lymphadenopathy by size criteria. There is no pneumothorax.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions, right more than left, with associated atelectasis are noted.
 Biapical scarring is noted.  Mild septal thickening with perihilar opacities
 suggest an element of pulmonary edema.6mm right apical nodule is noted, not
 seen on recent chest CT from [**2116-12-9**], and likely is due to septal thickening
 and fluid.

 NON-CONTRAST ABDOMINAL CT:  There is a small amount of intra-abdominal
 ascites, mostly in the perihepatic region.  The gallbladder demonstrates mild
 wall thickening and probable pericholecystic fluid, but is not markedly
 distended.  Slightly hyperdense material in the gallbladder may represent
 sludge or concentrated bile.  Spleen, adrenals, pancreas appear unremarkable.
 Both kidneys are in normal anatomic location.  There is nonspecific
 perinephric stranding.  A 1.9 x 1.7 cm lesion in the interpolar region of the
 right kidney demonstrates Hounsfield units of 37, possibly a complex cyst.
 Both kidneys are mildly lobulated.  There is no hydronephrosis or evidence of
 renal trauma.  The abdominal aorta and iliac vessels demonstrate moderate
 atherosclerotic calcifications with no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation.

 There is no lymphadenopathy.  No fluid in the mesentery to suggest mesenteric
 injury is identified.  There is no bowel wall thickening, bowel obstruction,
 or evidence of bowel trauma.

 PELVIC CT WITH CONTRAST:  Rectosigmoid colon, seminal vesicles, prostate
 gland, collapsed urinary bladder containing a Foley catheter are unremarkable.
 There is a rectal tube in place.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is a mildly displaced transvers fracture of the mid
 sternum which likely involves the medial aspect of the anterior left third
 rib.  There are bilateral pars defects at L5 vertebral body with grade 1
 anterolisthesis of L5 upon S1.  Mild compression fracture of L1 vertebral body
 is age indeterminate.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. Mildly displaced transversefracture of the mid sternum likely involves the
 medial aspect of the anterior left third rib with associated substernal
 anterior mediastinal hematoma.
 2. Mild pulmonary edema with bilateral small pleural effusions with associated
 atelectasis.
 3. 1.9 cm right renal hypodense lesion, likely a complex cyst. A renal
 ultrasound is recommended further evaluation.
 4. Gallbladder wall edema and trace perihepatic ascites, likely related to
 heart failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   1. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to scar tissue
   from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  Neurologic etiologies
   such as seizure or stroke are also possible.  His pupils are fixed and
   dilated indicating either medication effect (paralytic) or neurological
   catastrophe. He is bradycardic; may be secondary to infarction vs.
   [**Location (un) **] reflex vs  medication effect given that he was on a b-blocker,
   although this is less likely.
   - cooling protocol with Arctic Sun aborted [**2-9**] bradycardia
   - trend enzymes and labs
   - neurology consult, 48 hour EEG per protocol
 likely to weigh in on
   brain death
   - sedation with Fentanyl/Versed and paralytics PRN for shivering
   - aspirin, lipitor for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is 3.0
 3.7
   - hold on b-blocker while hypotensive on dopamine
   - continue amiodarone for arrhythmia
   .
   2. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lungs sound clear but diminished, chest CT with mild pulmonary
   edema.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - Fentanyl/Versed for sedation with PRN paralytic
   .
   3. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Current electrolytes and acid/base status is
   increasingly acidotic and hyperkalemic.  Etiology for renal failure is
   likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion.  Per report, pt received ~2L
   NS at the OSH and 1L NS in the ED with no output since. No response to
   Lasix. Renal failure likely to worse with epinephrine and severe
   bradycardia.
   - monitor volume status
   - urine electrolyes, UA
   - hold ACE, renally dose meds
   .
   4. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 35-40%.  Pt is already intubated,
   has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
   - fluids to try to preserve kidney function
   - monitor respiratory status
   - holding ACE
   .
   5. ELEVATED WBC: Likely in the setting of stress response to cardiac
   arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI.
   - blood cultures, urine culture
   - continue to monitor
   - hold on antibiotics for now
   .
   6. DM:
   - continue home insulin regimen of Lantus
   - regular insulin sliding scale while NPO
   .
   7. FEN: NPO for now; IV fluids
   .
   8. ACCESS: R femoral triple lumen; L arterial line; L intraosseous
   access placed in the field
   .
   9. PPX: INR therapeutic on Coumadin for DVT prophylaxis; Famotidine for
   stress ulcer prophylaxis; colace and senna PRN

   Chief Complaint:  found unconscious
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, DM, CHF EF 35-40%, afib,
   stage IV diabetic nephropathy (Cr 3.0) who presented to the ED after a
   witness unresponsive episode.  Per the family, he was walking down the
   street and had a wittness loss of consciousness.  EMS was called and he
   was taken to [**Hospital 2369**] hospital.  On arrival (11:20am) he was in
   asystole.  He was given Epi X 3 and Atropine X 1.  He then went into
   Vfib and shocked (200 joules).  He then went into Afib and became
   bradycardic.  Dopamine was started.  He regained a perfusing rhythm at
   11:35am.  He was given Calcium chloride, Magnesium, Amiodarone 300mg IV
   X 1 and bicarb during the resuscitation at [**Last Name (un) 2369**].  He later had
   another episode of VT at 12:40 and an amiodarone gtt was started.  He
   was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1**] ED.
   .
   Per [**Hospital1 1**] ED report, he had presented to [**Hospital 2369**] hospital in Vfib, then
   became asystolic.  After the initial resuscitation he had 2 additional
   asystolic arrests in the [**Last Name (un) 2369**] ER.
   .
   In the [**Hospital1 1**] ED, initial vitals were T98.2 HR75, BP149/106, RR32 100%
   on the vent.  The post-arrest consult team was called and recommended
   cooling him to 33-34 degrees and weaning his propofol to
   fentanyl/versed.  A R femoral line was placed, he was given 1L IVF and
   had a head, chest, abdomen CT done without contrast.  He was kept on
   dopamine, propofol and amiodarone.  He was given 1mg Atropine for
   bradycardia to 35During transfer to the floor, he became bradycardic.
   External pacer pad were placed and his dopamine was increased from
   15mcg/kg to 20mcg/kg.  He was briefly externally paced and given
   additional an additional 1mg of Atropine.  On arrival to the CCU he was
   not being paced and his dopamine was back down to 15mcg/min.  CT scan
   showed a sternal fracture and mediastinal hematoma.

   Imaging: 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**12-15**]:
   The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
   cavity size are normal. There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm.
   There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   akinesis of the inferior wall, hypokinesis of the mid to distal
   anterior septum and hypookinesis of the inferolateral wall. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
   dilated with normal free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
   aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-4-8**], LVH is
   not seen on the current study. The anterior septum may be slightly more
   hypokinetic on the current study. The degree of mitral regurgitation is
   slightly less. The other findings are similar.
   .
   [**2117-1-16**] CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis:
   1. Mildly displaced transversefracture of the mid sternum likely
   involves the medial aspect of the anterior left third rib with
   associated substernal anterior mediastinal hematoma.
   2. Mild pulmonary edema with bilateral small pleural effusions with
   associated atelectasis.
   3. 1.9 cm right renal hypodense lesion, likely a complex cyst. A renal
   ultrasound is recommended further evaluation.
   4. Gallbladder wall edema and trace perihepatic ascites, likely related
   to heart failure.
   .
   [**2117-1-16**]: Head CT: No acute intracranial abnormality. Sinus disease, as
   noted above.
   .
   [**2117-1-16**]: CT C-Spine:
   1. No acute fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.
   2. Pulmonary edema and right pleural effusion, partially imaged.
   3. Multilevel degenerative changes, worst at C4-C5, which predisposes
   the patient to cord injury. Consider MRI for further evaluation if
   clinically indicated.

   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   1. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to scar tissue
   from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  Neurologic etiologies
   such as seizure or stroke are also possible.  His pupils are fixed and
   dilated indicating either medication effect (paralytic) or neurological
   catastrophe. He is bradycardic; may be secondary to infarction vs.
   [**Location (un) **] reflex vs  medication effect given that he was on a b-blocker,
   although this is less likely.
   - cooling protocol with Arctic Sun aborted [**2-9**] bradycardia
   - trend enzymes and labs
   - neurology consult, 48 hour EEG per protocol
 likely to weigh in on
   brain death
   - sedation with Fentanyl/Versed and paralytics PRN for shivering
   - aspirin, lipitor for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is 3.0
 3.7
   - hold on b-blocker while hypotensive on dopamine
   - continue amiodarone for arrhythmia
   .
   2. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lungs sound clear but diminished, chest CT with mild pulmonary
   edema.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - Fentanyl/Versed for sedation with PRN paralytic
   .
   3. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Current electrolytes and acid/base status is
   increasingly acidotic and hyperkalemic.  Etiology for renal failure is
   likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion.  Per report, pt received ~2L
   NS at the OSH and 1L NS in the ED with no output since. No response to
   Lasix. Renal failure likely to worse with epinephrine and severe
   bradycardia.
   - monitor volume status
   - urine electrolyes, UA
   - hold ACE, renally dose meds
   .
   4. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 35-40%.  Pt is already intubated,
   has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
   - fluids to try to preserve kidney function
   - monitor respiratory status
   - holding ACE
   .
   5. ELEVATED WBC: Likely in the setting of stress response to cardiac
   arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI.
   - blood cultures, urine culture
   - continue to monitor
   - hold on antibiotics for now
   .
   6. DM:
   - continue home insulin regimen of Lantus
   - regular insulin sliding scale while NPO

   experienced to shocks over the w/e and came to clinic on Monday and her
   potassium was 3.0. She received K+ repletion, but states her stomach
   was upset. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7384**] called her today and she reported more shocks.
   SHe was told to take ambulance to EW, which she did. In the EW her
   pacemaker/ICD was interrogated and showed  she has 2 shocks on [**5-11**]
   shocks on [**5-12**] and one shock today. The rhythm was the same for all
   these event-a very fast VF terminated by internal defibrillation. Labs
   were drawn and she was transfered to CCU for further care.
   Pt arrived in CCU at 1800 A & O X 3 and in no distress.  She was in V
   paced with frequent PVCs. At 1825 she went into VT and was shocked out
   of it. She has had over 10 subsequent episodes. Aggressively rxed with
   potassium & magnesium repletion-placed on Amiodarone & lidocaine gtts
   after appropriate boluses. Without further episodes of VF/Torsades
   since [**5-13**] [**2126**].
   Ventricular tachycardia, non-sustained (NSVT)
   Assessment:
   Intially having frequent runs of VF/Torsades. Episodes resulting in ICD
   firing & terminating rhythm.

   ICU Event Note/Cardiac Arrest and Death
   .
   Called to see patient for code blue cardiac arrest at approximately
   4:50am.  At that time, patient was pulseless and receiving CPR, and
   being ventilated.  PEA algorithim was followed -- see code report for
   details -- and initial impression was for metabolic arrest [**2-9**] to
   hyperkalemia/hypoglycemia or acidemia.  She was given bicarbonate,
   glucose, insulin and calcium in addition to
   epinephrine/atropine/vasopressin.  Pulse was intermittently recovered
   and patient was given IVF's, dopamine and neosynephrine.  Femoral line
   was placed for IV access.  Intubation was complicated by significant
   amount of aspiration of stomach contents during the code.  Patient was
   difficult to oxygenate during the code, but after successful intubation
   there were no further apparent complications with her airway.  Bedside
   echo demonstrated no pericardial effusion/tamponade, and showed a
   hypocontractile left ventricle.  She had symmetric breath sounds, and
   no apparent evidence of tension pneumothorax.  She was shocked for VT
   x2 by external pacer pads during the code with successful return of
   underlying rhythm, but without sustained return of her pulse.
   Ultimately, pulse could not be maintained  in the face of substantial
   acidemia, and hypoxemia.  Lab work demonstrated profound respiratory
   acidemia with pH < 7.0.  She was given bicarbonate acutely and bag
   ventilation was increased.  After 45 minutes of the above the decision
   was made to terminate the code given prolonged hypoxemia and
   pulselessness.  Time of death: 5:37AM.  [**Hospital **] healthcare proxy,
   PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] care team notified.
   Total time spent:  45 minutes

   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10408**] is an 89 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p CABG and multiple PCIs most recently in [**4-21**], ischemic
   cardiomyopathy with an LVEF 25-30%, PAF, and [**Hospital **] transferred from an
   OSH for cardiac catheterization after VF arrest. The patient initially
   presented to OSH on [**2104-11-8**] with chest pain. Per review of records, the
   chest pain woke him from sleep at 2 am described as [**8-22**] epigastric
   pain and did not improve with SL NTG. He then was taken to an OSH ED,
   where he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with RVR with lateral
   STD. While in the OSH ED, he developed [**11-22**] left-sided chest pain
   different from intial chest pain that resolved with NTG and morphine.
   His labs at that time were notable for elevated cardiac biomarkers to
   CK 42, MB 3.1, TnT 0.22.  Cardiology was consulted with recommendation
   for cardiac catheterization.  Prior to catheterization, however, the
   patient had VF arrest on [**11-10**] with ROSC after defibrillation x2, CPR,
   calcium, and amiodarone.  At that point, the patient was started on
   heparin gtt, integrillin gtt, and taken to cardiac catheterization.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated 60% proximal and mid-LAD, 80-90%
   LCx, 100% proximal RCA, some in-stent resteonsis of OM with IABP
   placed. CT surgery was consulted for possible CABG, which the family
   deferred pending transfer to [**Hospital1 19**] for further evaluation and repeat
   cardiac catheterization.  Of note, the patient received 4 units PRBCs
   at OSH for a hct of 28.7.  In addition, the patient was also admitted
   to [**Hospital1 19**] on [**9-20**] for chest pain that resolved without
   intervention.

   TTE ([**7-/2101**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately-to-severely
   depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent); there is global hypokinesis
   with regional variation: the posterior wall and apex are severely
   hypokinetic; the rest of the left ventricle is moderately hypokinetc.
   Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an E/e' <8 suggesting a normal
   left ventricular filling pressure. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
   left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Moderate (2+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

   CARDIAC CATH ([**2104-5-8**]):  1. Selective coronary angiography of this
   right dominant system revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.
   THe LAD had 60% stenosis at the origin, patent stents, and diffuse
   disease distally. The LCX had a 90% stenosis in the obtuse marginal,
   80% stenosis at the mid segment of the LCX, and 90% stenosis in both
   posterolateral branches off of the distal LCX.  The RCA was known
   previously to be occluded proximally.
   2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal systemic blood
   pressure with aortic pressure 114/51 mm Hg.
   3.  Successful angioplasty of the obtuse marginal branch with a 2.0mm
   balloon. Final angiography demonstrated a mild vessel dissection with
   excellent flow throughout the vessel (See PTCA comments).
   4.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the LCX with a Xience (2.5x15mm)
   drug eluting stent postdilated with a 2.75mm balloon.  Final
   angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, no
   residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout the vessel (See PTCA

 INDICATION:  Cardiac arrest with intubation.

 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest.

 COMPARISON:  Review of subsequent radiograph of the same date obtained
 approximately one hour after.

 FINDINGS:  Evaluation is limited by positioning and low lung volumes.  Dense
 opacification at the left base is consistent with atelectasis though an
 underlying aspiration or pneumonia are additional possibilities.  Relatively
 [**Name2 (NI) 29088**] opacification of the left hemithorax as compared to the right could
 represent asymmetric edema, pneumonia, aspiration of layering pleural effusion
 in part.  The patient is intubated with endotracheal tube low lying
 approximately 2 cm above the carina.  Review of subsequent radiograph
 demonstrates endotracheal tube tip in appropriate position.  A central venous
 catheter terminates in the uppermost part of the right atrium.  The heart size
 is not well evaluated due to positioning; however, there may be mild
 cardiomegaly.  There are calcifications of the aortic arch.  Soft tissue
 anchors are noted in the right shoulder.

 INDICATION:  Patient with cardiac arrest.  Assess for intracranial hemorrhage.

 COMPARISONS:  None available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired contiguous images through the head were obtained
 without intravenous contrast at 5-mm slice thickness.  Coronally and
 sagittally reformatted images were displayed.

 FINDINGS:

 There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift
 of normal midline structures.  Focal hypodensity involving the anterior limb
 of the left internal capsule is noted (2:16).  There is no large vascular
 territorial infarction.  The sulci and ventricles appear prominent, likely
 age-related involutional changes.  The basal cisterns are patent.  There is no
 hydrocephalus.  [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation appears well preserved.
 There is no cerebral edema.  The orbits are unremarkable.  Mucosal thickening
 of the ethmoid air cells and the right maxillary sinus are noted.  Mastoid air
 cells appear well aerated.  Nasogastric tube is partially imaged.  Small
 amounts of secretions within the nasopharynx are noted.  No acute fracture is
 seen.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.

 2.  Focal hypodensity involving the left caudate head.  The chronicity of this
 finding is indeterminate, due to lack of previous exams, and it likely
 represents remote infarction or sequela of small vessel ischemic disease.

 INDICATION:  Patient with cardiac arrest, intubated, assess for cervical spine
 injury.

 COMPARISONS:  None available.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial images through the cervical spine were obtained at 2-mm
 slice thickness.  Coronally and sagittally reformatted images were displayed.

 FINDINGS:

 There is no evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.  Extensive
 degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine is noted, most pronounced at
 C5-C6 and C6-C7 with associated intervertebral disc degeneration and
 subchondral sclerosis.  Extensive anterior and posterior disc osteophyte
 complexes are noted at the corresponding levels, with mild impingement on
 thecal sac.  There is no critical central canal stenosis.  Prevertebral soft
 tissue assessment is limited due to oro gastric and endotracheal tube
 placement.  Soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.  Mild mucosal
 thickening of the right maxillary sinus is partially imaged.  Possible pleural
 thickening and ground-glass opacities in the left lung apex are partially
 imaged.  There is no pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:

 No evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.  Extensive degenerative disc
 disease of the cervical spine, most pronounced at C5-C6 and C6-C7.  In the
 setting of high clinical suspicion for ligamentous or cord injury, MR may be
 considered for further assessment.
