Date of Birth:   [**2127-2-27**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiac surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 39-year-old woman with
diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and obesity, with a
one to two months of chest burning with exertion. For the
past six months, she has been participating in a new vigorous
exercise program to lose weight. Her symptoms do gradually
resolve with rest, but they have started to occur now with
walking. She does acknowledge that there is associated
nausea, diaphoresis and shortness of breath. Now recently she
started to get symptoms for the past two days while at rest.
She was referred for an outpatient exercise tolerance test,
where she had chest pain and significant EKG changes. She was
referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization today, which
revealed significant left main artery disease. Just prior to
her transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she did complain of chest pain and
back pain at about 7/10 intensity and a nitroglycerin drip
was started and she received 5 mg of IV Lopressor and 2 mg of
IV Ativan, which did resolve her pain. While she was in the
cath lab, she had an intraaortic balloon pump placed, and now
she is not actively complaining of any pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies any orthopnea, lower extremity
edema, but she does acknowledge that she does have
dysmenorrhea.

PRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY:  She has diabetes mellitus, type 2,
diagnosed in [**2157**]. She has been able to control it with diet
since [**2166-6-22**]; hypertension and obesity; however, she has
lost 40 pounds in the last six months.

SHE HAS AN ALLERGY TO SHELLFISH.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFERS TO [**Hospital1 18**]:  Atenolol 50 mg a day,
lisinopril 10 mg a day, Lipitor 20 mg a day, aspirin 325 mg
once a day, progesterone, nitroglycerin drip, Lopressor,
Ativan.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke. She does not use ethanol
and she does not use cocaine. Her father had a brain tumor.
Her brother did have coronary artery disease and a myocardial
infarction in his late 30s. Her mother has hypertension. She
does have a strong family history for hyperlipidemia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is comfortable appearing,
in no apparent distress. Vital signs: Temperature 99.1, pulse
72, blood pressure 144/87. Pulse oximetry is 98% on room air.
Head and neck: PERRLA. EOMI. Anicteric. Mucous membranes
moist. Neck supple, no lymphadenopathy, no JVD. Cardiac:
Regular rate and rhythm. Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, but
she is morbidly obese, positive bowel sounds. Her extremities
are warm, no edema. She has got 5/5 strength in all
extremities.

Her laboratories prior to admission from [**Hospital3 1280**] were
white count 7.4, hematocrit of 39.8, platelets 190,000.
Hemoglobin A1c was 7.1. Sodium was 140, potassium 4.1,
chloride 103, bicarbonate 28, BUN 14, creatinine 0.6. Total
cholesterol was 307, triglycerides were 79, and HDL was 50.

[**Last Name (STitle) 54218**], which was at [**Hospital3 1280**] (it was not at
[**Hospital1 18**]), showed diffuse left main and proximal left anterior
descending artery stenosis, 60% to 70%, which was ulcerative;
50% mid LAD stenosis; 50% left circumflex stenosis after OM1;
moderate right coronary artery stenosis; a normal ejection
fraction of 78%; no mitral regurgitation. Note that the right
coronary artery stenosis that I am reported is different than
what was actually reported on the initial catheterization
results from [**Hospital3 1280**]. This was discussed between Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**], and was not actually considered to be
80% as previously reported.

So this was a woman who was considered to have unstable
angina but not actively ischemic. She was put on an
intraaortic balloon pump, followed in the cardiac care unit,
and was ""preoped"" and consented for a CABG on the next day
because of her three-vessel disease. She was made n.p.o.
after midnight and then in the morning she was taken to the
operating room.

On[**Last Name (STitle) 19203**] of [**2167-1-9**], Ms. [**Known lastname 42915**] went to the
operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for bypass surgery.
Please refer to the previously dictated operative note by Dr.
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for the specifics of this surgery. In brief,
three grafts were made. One was a left internal mammary to
the left anterior descending artery and then two saphenous
vein grafts were connected to the OM1 and OM2. She was on
cardiopulmonary bypass for 76 minutes and the aorta was cross
clamped for 53 of those minutes.

She tolerated the surgery well and was transferred to the
intensive care unit on propofol and Neo-Synephrine drips.

Postoperatively, Ms. [**Known lastname 42915**] did extremely well. Her
intraaortic balloon pump and all of her intravenous drips
were discontinued on postoperative day one. On postoperative
day two she was extubated and on postoperative day three she
was transferred to the floor. Ms. [**Known lastname 54219**] major floor issues
were as follows.

Ms. [**Known lastname 42915**] was followed by physical therapy, which cleared
her to go home with home physical therapy to assist with
mobility, strength and endurance. She was also actively
diuresed with Lasix and had her potassium repleted
accordingly. Finally, she was noted to have hyperglycemia
while she resumed her regular diet. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8392**] consultation
was obtained and they recommended metformin 500 mg twice a
day to maintain euglycemia. She would follow her sugar as an
outpatient and report this back in an outpatient followup
appointment.

On [**1-14**] the patient's central line was discontinued.
She was scheduled to leave, but she developed chest pain;
however, this chest pain was considered not to be cardiac, to
be more gastrointestinal in nature, and she had ......... and
an EKG, both of which confirmed a noncardiac source for this
chest pain.

She is, therefore, on [**1-15**], postoperative day six,
being discharged home in good condition with home physical
therapy scheduled.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Obesity.
4.  Hyperlipidemia.
5.  Unstable angina.
6.  Three-vessel coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass grafting, status post intraaortic
balloon pump.
7.  Hypokalemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metoprolol 100 mg t.i.d.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week.
6.  Potassium chloride 10 mEq p.o. b.i.d. for one week.
7.  Metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.;  follow your blood sugar
levels and follow up with [**Doctor First Name 8392**].
8.  Percocet one to two tablets every four hours as needed
for pain.
9.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. as needed for constipation.

[**Last Name (STitle) 54220**]owup appointments are with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her primary
care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] one to two weeks, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**], her
cardiologist, in two to three weeks, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from [**Doctor First Name 8392**]
as directed, and Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in one month. She is also
recommended to follow up in [**Hospital1 18**] Wound Care Clinic in one to
two weeks to remove her staples.

If the previously right coronary artery stenosis is a cause
for concern or patient morbidity in the future, this lesion
can certainly be addressed percutaneously with balloon
angiography. She will be followed very closely by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 677**]
as an outpatient, and if this lesion does cause her problems,
this may be addressed.

History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 87 yo M with chronic kidney disease
s/p AV Graft placement [**8-2**], stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and
peripheral vascular disease presents with chest pain and
shortness of breath. He reports that his chest pain began
approximately one week ago. During the week it has gotten worse.
It is substernal, radiating to left shoulder, especially with
inspiration. It is associated with shortness of breath. He came
to the hospital today because the pain was much worse, [**9-6**]. In
addition, he noted today black stools. He has been taking iron.
He reports lightheadedness. Denies nausea, vomiting,
diaphoresis, arm paresthesias. He has also noticed a cough
recently but has not been able to produce sputum (though he
feels congested).
.
The pt was seen in Geriatric Urgent Care clinic on [**9-11**] for
dyspnea. He noted worsening in the supine position. An CXR at
the time to evaluate possible CHF showed ""No evidence of
congestive heart failure or pneumonia. Elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm"".
.
In the ED, the patient was given 80mg IV lasix x 2 with UOP of
100-200cc. He received nitropaste, lopressor IV and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and
morphine, and was started on a nitro gtt. Heparin was started as
well, and 1 unit PRBCs was transfused. He was given one dose of
protonix, levofloxacin and . BPs were in the 110s-120s/50s-60s,
HR 70s-80s. Renal, GI, and cardiology consults were called. The
patient continued to report [**9-6**] pain, eventually decreased to
[**6-6**] with titration of the nitro gtt. On arrival in the CCU, he
still reported [**6-6**] pain. He was on nitro at 120 mcg/min and
heparin at 850 units/hr.

COMMENTS:
1. Right heart catheterization revealed elevated right and left
sided
pressures. (PCWP = 25 mmhg).
2. Left heart catheterization revealed no evidence of systolic
hypertension.  Calculated cardiac output and index were 5.0/2.8.

3. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
three vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main coronary
artery had
a 40% mid-vessel stenosis.  The left anterior descending artery
had
diffuse proximal disease with serial 70-80% stenosis.  The left
anterior
descending had mild diffuse disease in the mid and distal
segments.  The
large first diagonal had an 80% proximal lesion.  The left
circumflex
coronary artery had mild diffuse disease in the proximal, mid,
and
distal segments.  There was a subtotal occlusion of the OM1.
The right
coronary artery was the dominant vessel.  There was total
occlusion of
the right coronary artery in the proximal segment.  The distal
RCA
filled via collaterals from the LCA septal branches.
4. No left ventriculography was undertaken given elevated Cr.
5. Successful predilation using 2.0 X 12 sprinter balloon and
stenting
using a minivision 2.5 X 23 stent of the proximal OM1 with
lesion
reduction from 99 to 0%
6. Successful predilaton using a 2.0 X 20 Maverick balloon and
stenting
using 3.0 X 30 Driver stent of the proximal LAD with lesion
reduction
from 80% to 0%.
7. Successful predilation using 2.0 X 12 sprinter balloon and
stenting
using a 2.25 X 15 minivision stent of the proximal D1 with
lesion
reduction from 80% to 0%. The final angiogram showed TIMI III
flow in
the vessels intervened with no residual stenoses in any of the
stents.
Thre was no distal embolisation or dissection noted in any
vessel.
8. Successful insertion of IABP via right femoral artery.
( see PTCA comments for the above procdures from 5 through to 8)

9. At the request of the renal consultants, a 12 French Dialysis
central
venous catheter was placed using the Seldinger technique in the
left
common femoral vein.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated right and left sided pressures.
3. Preserved cardiac output/cardiac index.
4. Successful stenting of the OM, LAD and D1.
5. Successful insertion of IABP via right femoral artery.
6. Successful implantation of a central venous dialysis catheter
in the
left femoral vein.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Rhythm: pt had 2 episodes of monomorphic VT accompanied by
fall in BP, LOC, terminated x 1 via precordial thumb.
Electrolytes were repeleted, pt was bolused with Amiodarone x 2,
and started on an Amio gtt. Amiodarone was then changed to po,
with a dosing schedule of 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one week, followed by
400 mg daily for one week, then 200 mg per day.  Monomorphic VT
thought to be likely due to a fixed area of scarring from
previous MI.  Placement of an ICD was discussed.  However, given
the pt's poor prognosis for non sudden cardiac death reasons,
and given his increased infectious risk, it was decided to treat
his arrhythmia medically.  Of note, the QT interval was
prolonged (506), likely secondary to amiodarone.  Patient
remained in sinus rhythm on Amiodarone.
2. CAD: Pt with NSTEMI. Cath on [**9-12**] showed 3 vessel disease,
subsequently underwent successful stenting of OM, D1, LAD and
IABP placement. IABP was discontinued after the patient was able
to maintain his own pressure.
Echo completed on [**9-13**], which showed apical akinesis, with
severely depressed systolic function.  Patient was initially
started on heparin and bridged to Coumadin, however, he had
another episode of guaiac positive stool, and given his history
of melena and coffee ground emesis, the risk for GI bleed was
thought to be high and anticoagulation was discontinued.
The patient was continued on an aspirin, Statin, beta blocker,
and was started on an ACE, all of which he will continue as an
outpatient.  His swan and sheath were discontinued without
complications.
3.PUMP: CHF: EF 20% by ECHO
He was initially placed on Imdur/Hydral for afterload reduction
and an ACE was initially avoided in an attempt to salvage his
kidneys.  However, he was eventually started on low-dose
lisinopril to be titrated up if necessary.  Patient also
underwent hemodialysis on Mon/Wed/Fri schedule.
4. Renal: Chronic renal disease, secondary to hypertensive
nephrosclerosis, is status post graft placement with mature A-V
graft. Quentin catheter initially used, then discontinued once
graft accessible.  On [**9-22**], graft noted to be difficult to
access per renal, patient underwent AV fistulogram, and
successful angioplasty was performed.
5. ID: Patient completed a seven day course of levofloxacin for
suspected pneumonia, white blood count noted to be persistently
elevated.  Patient was pan cultured, and a urine culture was
positive for yeast.  Foley catheter was discontinued and a
repeat culture was sent, also positive for [**Female First Name (un) **].  Patient
started on a 2 week course of Fluconazole.  Blood cultures
pending at time of discharge, no growth to date.
6. Heme: anemia, likely anemia of chronic disease from chronic
renal disease.  Patient also had an episode of melena and coffee
ground emesis, guaiac positive stool.  Hematocrit was followed,
and patient was transfused as necessary to keep hematocrit above
30.  Patient will need GI workup as an outpatient. Oral iron
supplementation was discontinued as patient receiving Fe in
addition to EPO and Procrit at hemodialysis
7. DM: Patient was started on glargine for persistent
hyperglycemia and covered with a regular insulin sliding scale
with Accu-Check to monitor.
8. Psych: Patient was continued on his home dose of Zoloft 100
mg once daily.
Patient tolerated a low Na/cardiac healthy diet and was placed
on a PPI for GI prophylaxis.
Patient was discharged to rehab facility with plan to follow up
with cardiology and PCP within the next month.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and plan:
87 yo M with MMP including DM, HTN, CAD, PVD on HD with L arm
fistula presents with septic shock.
.
1. Sepsis:
The pt was found to be hypotensive and febrile in the ED and
admitted through sepsis protocol. He was infused with muliple
boluses of normal saline, put on levophed for blood pressure
support. He was covered with broad spectrum antibiotic
empirically as culture data was sent. Blood cultures were found
to be positive for gram postive cocci which was ultimately shown
to be VRE. Vancomycin was changed to linezolid. The pt remained
hypotensive on pressors for the next several days and a work-up
was initiated to determine the source of infection. MRI of the
foot was pursued to r/o osteomyelitis, and a CT of the abdomen
was down to r/o an abdominal source of infection.
   The CT Abdomen and pelvis showed possible abscess in liver
and spleen. There was also pancolitis. GI and Surgery were
[**Year/Month/Day 4221**] for assistance in the management of these problems.
For the pancolitis, the pt was kept NPO and he was treated for
possible c. diff infection while c. diff cultures were sent and
found to be positive. A RUQ U/S [**2135-2-2**] was pursued which showed
evidence of hypoechoic lesion could be flegmon or mass. It was
unable to be confirmed on imaging whether these lesions on CT
which were new compared with a previous scan in [**10-1**] were
abscesses vs possible mets from an unknown primary. IR was
[**Date Range 4221**] for possible drainage or biopsy, however option
declined given localization of lesions and the pts significant
bleeding risk. The GI team suggested an MRI to further evaluate
the liver lesions although this was unable to be pursued because
the pt was too unstable requiring pressors for bp support. A TTE
Echo was done to r/o endocarditis or abscess and was negative.
Head CT was negative for abscess as well.
.
2. CMO:
On the morning of [**2135-2-6**], the ICU team discussed with Mr
[**Known lastname **] wife and daughter the different alternatives for Mr
[**Known lastname **] care. It was explained that the feeling of the medical
staff and nurse staff was that Mr [**Known lastname **] has been extremily
uncomfortable with all the procedures that he undergoes during
the day. Despite giving pain medicines he has shown signs of a
lot of discomfort. We explained to the family that we would need
a NGT place in order to feed him and give him some of his
medicines now that he is having trouble swallowing given his
mental status. Also we have explained that we still not have a
clear dx on his liver lesions, and in order to obtained a dx he
might need a surgical intervention for biopsy. It would be a
long road ahead before he is able to go back to where he was
previously.
Ms [**Known lastname **] feels that her husband would not want to have all this
procedures done along the road and that we should change the
focus of care towards making him as comfortable as possible.
    The antibiotics and pressors were d/c'ed. The plan was to
have no more dialysis. There were no more lab draws. A morphine
drip was started for pain. The pt remained arousable though
sleepy. His blood pressure was in the 80s-90s systolic off
pressors and his extremities continued to show evidence of
perfusion. On the evening of [**12-10**], he skin became more pale and
his sensorium less alert. At 2:08 am he was found to have ceased
respirations and was without a heart rate on the monitor. By
2:15 am he was pronounced deceased.
.
2. CAD: h/o MI.
Continued sinvastatin, aspirin until made CMO. BB and BP
medications were held in the setting of hypotension
.
3. Peripheral vascular disease: continued plavix, Aspirin until
CMO
The vascular team followed the pt.
.
4. DM: insulin sliding scale was continued before the pt was
made CMO.
.
#. ESRD: The pt continued to recieve periodic dialysis sessions
while in house until he was made CMO.
.
#. FEN:
He was kept NPO given the colitis and sepsis.
.
# Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine until CMO.
.
# PPX: Pantoprazole, pneumoboots until CMO.
.
#Code: DNR-DNI was changed to CMO on [**2-6**]
.

.
old EKG ([**3-16**]): sinus brady @80 with atrial ectopy, low limb
voltage, nl axis/interval, no ST changes

Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD: Initial EKG showed marked depressions in v3-6. On
admission to the CCU, art line was placed, after which pt was
noted to be bradycardic to the 40s and hypotensive to 70s
according to the art line. Pt was bolused with IVF without
significant increase in BP. Dopamine was started. Pt was
asymptomatic. Pt was taken emergently to the cath lab as we were
concerned about acute ischemia. Pt was found to have diffuse
disease and 60-70% stenosis of LCx. In retrospect, pt's
hypotensive episode was most likely spurious, as the arterial
line BP and cuff pressures did not correlate. Cuff pressures did
not drop below 90s systolic during the entire time. Pt may have
some arterial stenosis which led to spurious BP. By cardiac
enzymes, pt was found to have NSTEMI with peak CK of 573 and
peak Tn of 1.09. Pt was started on Aspirin, Statin, plavix. BB
and ACE were initially held in setting of ""hypotension"", but
then was started. Later, decision was made to perform another
cath and to stent the LCx lesion which was done successfully.

2. DM: Pt was admitted in DKA with AG 17. He was started on
insulin drip and IVF and frequent electrolyte checks/repletions.
Gap was successfully closed. Pt was transitioned to insulin
pump.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6157**]
Chief Complaint:
epididymitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
incision and drainage of Fournier's gangrene

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 75 year old male who was transferred from an
outside hospital because of a suspected myocardial infarction on
[**2166-8-10**] and possible need for cardiac catheterization.  He was
admitted to the cardiology service initially.  His symproms
actually began six days prior to admission with flu-like
symptoms.  Then five days prior to admission, the patient began
complaining of a painful lump in his left testicle.  His
symptoms gradually worsened, with increasing pain, erythema, and
edema of his left testicle.  In addition, he complained of
difficulty urinating for two days prior to admission.  He was
admitted to an outside hospital four days prior to admission
here, at which time a Foley catheter was placed and he was
started on IV Levofloxacin and Clindamycin (which was switched
to Levofloxacin and Vancomycin the following day) for
epididymitis diagnosed by ultrasound.  The ultrasound also
showed questionable air in the scrotum.  The patient was seen by
a urologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], as well as an infectious disease
specialist.  He denied any trauma to his scrotum.  He has no
significant urologic history.  His prostate examination revealed
a 20 to 25 gram nonfluctuent prostate.  He is not diabetic and
he is not immunocompromised.  He reported that his pain has been
improving on the antibiotics.  However, on the night prior to
admission he developed acute pulmonary edema, shortness of
breath, hypotension and EKG changes suggestive of myocardial
infarction (ST elevation in leads V1-[**Street Address(2) 23394**] depression in
V5-6).  His peak troponin was 0.96.  Neo-synepherine was started
upon admission because of hypotension, which was presumed to be
secondary to sepsis.  Significant cardiac history includes a
CABG in [**2141**], hypertension, aortic stenosis, mitral
regurgitation, high cholesterol, and congestive heart failure
(EF of 40%).  Upon re-evaluation at this hospital, his EKG
changes were thought to be secondary to demand ischemia, rather
than a myocardial infarction.  In addition, the patient was
noted to be in acute renal failure, with a createnine of 1.8 on
admission, likely due to prerenal causes.  Blood and urine
cultures from the outside hospital were all negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the cardiology service at [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2166-8-10**] for presumed myocardial infarction on electrocardiogram,
which was later attributed to demand ischemia due to sepsis.  He
was initially started on neo-synephrine for hypotension.  He was
continued on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin for his epididymitis.
The urology team saw and evaluated the patient as a consult
service under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**].  Our suspicion of Fournier's gangrene
at that time was very low, considering his lack of risk factors
and lack of significant groin erythema, however a CT scan of his
abdomen and pelvis was ordered to rule out Fournier's.  That CT
scan confirmed the diagnosis of Fournier's gangrene on the
morning of hospital day two (tracking of air around his left
hemi scrotum tracking up the left spermatic cord.  At that time,
the patient was emergently rushed to the operating room for
emergent surgical debridement by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], chief
urology resident.  During the operation, the patient had the
majority of his left scrotum and all of his left testicle
removed.  He was then admitted to the trauma intensive care
unit.  He was sedated on Propofol with Fentanyl for pain.  He
was started on a Levophed drip to maintain blood pressure.  A
central venous line was placed, as well as a Swann Ganz
catheter.  An oro-gastric tube was placed and put to gravity.
His Foley was continued from the operating room.  Dressing
changes to his scrotum were scheduled for three times per day.
On postoperative day two, his maximum temperature was 101.0.
His Levophed drip was weaned to a low level. Tube feeds were
started through his NG tube.  On postoperative day three, the
plastic surgery service began their evaluation of the patient
for future closure of his wound.  His propofol was discontinued.
 His Levophed was discontinued.  He vomited twice and his tube
feeds were held for high residuals.  He recieved one unit of red
blood cells for a hematocrit under 30, and his hematocrit
responded well.  His acute renal appeared to have resolved, as
his createnine dropped down to 1.0.  On postoperative day four,
his ventillator was weaned to pressure support, however he had
some apneic spells.  A HIT panel was negative and his
subcutaneous heparin was restarted.  He had some bedside
debridement by the urology team and his wound looked like it was
healing well.  He was transfused with another unit of red blood
cells.  The patient was noted to be roughly twenty liters
positive and diuresis with a Lasix drip was started as
tolerated.  On postoperative day seven, the patient required
some propofol for sedation due to endotracheal tube and
oro-gastric tube irritation.  A sputum culture came back
positive for MRSA sensative to Vancomycin.  His wound cultures
were positive for mixed flora including Bacteroides, Provatella,
and coagulase negative Staphylococcus.  A wound VAC was placed
by urology.  On postoperative day eight, a post-pyloric feeding
tube was placed by interventional radiology because the patient
was not tolerating tube feeds via the oro-gastric tube.  On
postoperative day nine, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**] agreed to allow placement of a
tracheostomy tube and a PEG tube at a later date.  The patient
had been unable to tolerate a ventillator wean up to this point,
most likely due to his fluid overload and his cardiac history.
Tube feeds were running at agoal of 90ml/ hour.  On
postoperative day ten, his Flagyl and Levofloxacin were
discontinued.  He was transfused one unit of blood for a
hematocrit less than thirty.  On postoperative day twelve, he
recieved another unit of red blood cells.

On POD 14, a #8 percutaneous trach was placed at the bedside.  A
perc PEG was placed uner direct visualization, but the tube was
pulled through the abdominal wall.  The patient was subsequently
taken to the OR for an open gastrostomy tube which was placed
without further complication.  Vancomycin was stopped on [**8-25**]
after a complete 14-day course.  On [**2166-8-27**], the wound was
closed primarily at the bedside by the plastic surgery service.
TF were restarted on [**2166-8-27**] and advanced as tolerated.  A PICC
line was also placed on [**2166-8-27**].  Propofol was d/c'd on [**2166-8-28**].
 ON [**2166-8-28**], the patient spiked a temp to 102.  Cultures were
drawn and the A-line tip sent for culture as well.  [**2166-8-29**] tube
feeds were held for high residuals, an ileus was found on
imaginig.  PT evaluation occured on [**2166-8-29**].  Trach mask trials
were started on [**2166-8-28**] and the vent weaned as tolerated, with
the patient still requring vent assistance most of the day.
Vancomycin was restarted on [**2166-8-30**] for MRSA sputum; it will be
continued for 7 days; the JP drain was removed on this day as
well.  TF were restarted on [**2166-9-1**] and brought to goal over the
next day.  The patient is now tolerating TF at goal with bowel
movements.

On [**2166-9-3**], the patient was tolerating TF at goal, having bowel
movements, tolerating trach mask trials daily, was working with
PT, had good pain control with roxicet elixer, was alert and
requring no sedation.  He was subsequently transfered to rehab
for physical therapy and vent weaning.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Admit for carotid angiography and possible intervention.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
S/P stenting of left carotid artery


History of Present Illness:
64 year-old woman, patient of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 122**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], with an extensive history of CAD,
now s/p recent left upper lobectomy for lung cancer with an
incidental finding of an old CVA on head CT postoperatively
prompting a workup that revealed 90% left internal carotid
stenosis on duplex, vs 55% on CTA of neck, now referred for left
carotid angiography to more clearly define her carotid anatomy,
and carotid intervention, if appropriate. Events were as
follows:
[**2128-9-28**] IMI - Treated with stenting of the RCA and LCx. Found
to have severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 12876**] and was referred for
surgical repair.
[**2128-10-27**] Mitral valve surgery aborted after TEE at time of
surgery revealed largely normal mitral valve with improvement of
inferior hypokinesis compared to month prior.
[**3-/2129**] Cardiac Catheterization - Total occlusion of RCA stent and
patent LCX stent, mild to mod MR
[**7-/2129**] Pulmonary edema requiring intubation at an OSH. Transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] and had a cardiac cath revealing T.O RCA and 40% CX
stenosis in prior stent. EF of 30%
[**2129**] AICD placement
[**2135-10-24**] Cath d/t worsening chronic angina and DOE and inferior
ischemia on dobutamine viability study. Angiography revealed 40%

LAD, 40% LCX ISRS, RCA totally occluded with distal filling via
left to right collaterals. S/P Unsuccesful recanalization of the
RCA. FFR of CX lesion demonstrated it to be a hemodynamically
insignificant lesion.
[**2136-2-2**] s/p VATS, left upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node
dissection d/t adenocarcinoma. Patient d/c'd on [**2-8**] and
readmitted on [**2-13**] d/t mental status changes and hypotension. A
chest CT was done which was negative for a PE. A CT of the head
was done revealing no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, but a
hypodensity at the right temporo-occipital junction. This could
represent a late subacute to chronic infarct vs metastatic
disease. A CT with contrast was done the following day revealing
the same findings. A carotid series was therefore ordered and
done on [**2136-2-15**]. This revealed an 80-99% stenosis of the left
internal carotid artery and a <40% stenosis of the right
internal carotid artery. A TTE was done on [**2136-2-15**]. This
revealed an ef of 40% with 1+MR, small to moderate sized
pericardial effusion. Mild symmetric LVH. Hypokinesis noted in
the infero-septum, inferior and infero-lateral walls. Akinesis
noted in the basal infero-septum and inferior wall.
.
The patient was subsequently referred to see Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
as an outpatient who has recommended her for carotid angiography
and intervention. The patient was then seen in clinic by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of neurology who is in agreement that the head
CT scan abnormality is very likely an embolic stroke and feels
that left carotid intervention is appropriate. The patient was
also seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] of neurosurgery who felt that
it is exceedingly unlikely that the lesion on CT scan represents
a malignancy vs. metastasis and cleared her to undergo a carotid
procedure. He recommended repeat head CT in 3 months.
.
Follow up studies have included:
[**2136-2-23**] Chest XRAY: Normal post left upper lobectomy appearance.
No evidence of any cardiopulmonary process.
[**2136-3-8**] CTA of neck: approximately 55% left sided carotid
stenosis at the bifurcation
[**2136-3-20**] CT of brain with and without contrast: No change of
right posterior temporal-occipital region, likely represents a
chronic infarct. Noted to have tortuous basilar artery. Basilary
artery summit positioned to the left of the midline. Just
anterior to the summit is a 2-mm area of contrast
enhancement--Finding could represent very tortuous origin of
left posterior cerebral artery or contigious tiny aneurysm.
.
In terms of symptoms, the patient denies any neurological
deficits, confusion,or lightheadedness. She further denies any
chest pain. She does report having dyspnea after climbing one
flight of stairs.
.
On day of admission, she underwent carotid angiography with
stent placement

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief [**Hospital **] Hospital Course is outlined below:

1) Enterobacter bacteremia: The patient was initially admitted
to the ICU on the MUST protocol based on a lactate of 4.4. He
was mildly hypotensive and febrile to 101.4. He was aggressively
hydrated with IVF and empirically initiated on amp/gent. He was
briefly placed on levophed/vasopressin pressors but was able to
be weaned off by his second hospital day. Blood cultures from
admission grew enterobacter in [**5-15**] bottles, pan sensitive. In
addition cultures were positive for yeast, unspeciated upon
discharge. Fluconazole was added to his regimen and ampicillin
was discontinued. The source of his infection was unclear,
although urine source was suspected given dirty urine on
admission. Admission urinalysis showed >50 RBCs, >50 WBC's and
moderate leukocytes, although urine cultures were negative. The
patient was transferred to the medicine service on [**2-17**], hospital
day #3. ID was consulted and recommended a switch to levaquin
based on culture sensitivities. Flagyl was also added for
empiric GI coverage pending further evaluation. CT abdomen was
performed and demonstrated no evidence of abscess or bowel
pathology. There was mention of gallstones and gallbladder wall
thickening suspicious for cholecystitis. However the patient
remained afebrile with no abdominal pains and normal liver
function tests. Given his clinical stability with maintenance of
his blood pressure off IVF, tolerance of PO intake, and absence
of fever, he was discharged to home on [**2-19**]. He was discharged
home on PO levaquin and PO fluconazole for a 14 day course based
on ID recommendations. Flagyl was discontinued. He will
follow-up with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2-12**] weeks.

2) Rheumatoid arthritis- previoiusly on plaquenil, so relatively
immunosuppressed. Granulocyte count on admission= 1680, so he
was not neutropenic. He was re-started on plaquenil after he was
clinically stable.

3) Anemia: secondary to SLE likely. Goal HCT>27. Hct remained
>30 through his hospital course. Initital decrease in hematocrit
was likely secondary to IVF hydration.

4) Edema: Noted peripheral edema following IVF hydration. He was
also noted to have bilateral pleural effusions by CT scan, also
likely secondary to aggressive fluid resuscitation. He was not
started on lasix since he was able to autodiurese well, with >2
liters off over the last 24 hours prior to discharge.

5) Mental status change: Initially delirious on admission,
likely secondary to his underlying infection. Once infection
cleared his mental status improved back to baseline. No further
evaluation was performed.

Chief Complaint:
Weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. endotracheal intubation
2. central venous catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
74 y/o M w/past hx of HTN and cervical radiculopathy, who
presented today c/o weakness. He stated that he thought he had
the flu over the past few days, with a nonproductive cough,
headache, and general weakness. Very poor PO intake. He was
recently prescribed effexor, and took his first dose this AM.
Approximately one hour after that, he felt much weaker. EMS was
called and on arrival his bp was 80/60. He received 1 L NS and
his bp responded to 120s.

On arrival to the ED, his bp was 110s-120s/60s with a pulse in
the 60s. He was awake, alert, and answering questions. His only
complaints were of a headache, and he felt like he had to
urinate but was unable to. He denied any chest pain, shortness
of breath, abdominal pain. Mild nausea but no vomiting. While
examining him, he became bradycardic to 42 and hypotensive to
60/40. He was febrile to 101.2 and diaphoretic. He received 2L
NS wide open with a mild response in his bp to 70s/50s. He was
put on peripheral dopamine. Bedside echo revealed no pericardial
effusion, possibly depressed EF, no visible aortic aneurysm, and
a dilated IVC. He was taken urgently to CT scan to r/o PE and
dissection.

In the CT scanner, he vomited. no aspiration observed and CXR no
infiltrate. No blood in vomit. He then became tachycardic to the
130s (narrow complex) which appeared to be SVT per ED resident
no ECG confirmation in CT. Dopamine stopped with normalization
of HR. He then again became tachycardic in the 130s, and this
time broke with carotid massage back down to 70. Still
hypotensive in 70s and so started on neo. CT showed no PE or
dissection.

When he returned, intubated for airway protection given vomiting
and hemodynamic instability. Never hypoxic or with resp
distress.  Good mentation per family. vanc/levoflox/flagyl and
decadron. Lactate was 1.6 and he had 1600 cc UOP. His SBP came
back up to the 160s and the neo was weaned off. Multiple
attempts at right subclavian caused 2 arterial sticks. CXR
showed no pneumo/hemothorax.

Subsequently became hypotensive again, and placed back on neo
and dopa.  Right IJ placed.  Sent to CCU. Given total of 3
liters NS.

Recently had epidural steroid inject ion [**2-23**]. No worsening of
back pain since that time.

Imaging:
[**2-25**] CXR:
Clear lungs.
[**2-25**] CT chest/abdomen/pelvis:
1. No evidence for pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
2. Focal mesenteric region of increased attenuation which most
likely represents inflammation secondary to mesenteric
panniculitis, or less likely trauma, edema, or tumor (lymphoma).
There is no evidence of mesenteric vasculature or bowel
compromise. A biopsy or CT scan in the future may provide
further diagnostic information.
3. Fluid within the esophagus which increases this patient's
risk of aspiration.
4. Multiple low-attenuation lesions throughout the liver which
most likely represent simple liver cysts; however, an ultrasound
examination could be performed for confirmation when the patient
is clinically stabilized.
[**2-27**] TTE:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve
morphology. Preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
function.


Brief Hospital Course:
74 M with fever and hypotension intubated electively for airway
protection.
.
# Hypotension:
He was hypotensive in the emergency department which was of
unclear etiology.  This was thought most likely to be due to
hypovolemia due to dehydration as his blood pressure normalized
with IV fluids.  By the end of his hospitalization he had
actually started to become hypertensive and was started on
lisinopril 10 mg daily.  His HCTZ was not restarted as it was
thought this may have been contributing to his hyponatremia.
.
Fever:
This was of unclear etiology and was attributed to a likely
viral syndrome.  He had no localizing signs or symptoms of
infection.  A test for influenza was negative as was a urine
culture.  Blood cultures were pending at discharge.  He was
initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics including
vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole.  Once his culture
data was negative he was switched to po levofloxacin and he was
discharged to complete a seven day course.
.
# Resp Failure:
He was intubated in the ED for airway protection but he was
successfully extubated shortly after arriving to the MICU and
maintained a normal O2 saturation throughout the rest of his
hospital course.
.
# Hyponatremia:
On admission he was initially hyponatremic with a sodium of 129.
 This was thought to be due to a combination of hypovolemia from
dehydration as well as HCTX effect.  With hydration and stopping
his HCTZ his sodium normalized and at discharge it was 134.
.
# Cervical radiculopathy:
He has a history of this and was last seen in neurology clinic
in [**2169**].  He intermittently complained of neck pain during his
admission and was set up with a follow-up appointment in
neurology with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**4-8**] at 3:00.
.
# Lower back pain:
He has a history of chronic lower back pain and spinal stenosis
and has been followed in the pain management center.  He was
kept on his gabapentin and has a follow-up appointment with the
pain clinic.
.
# Urinary hesitancy:
This is also a chronic issue for him and he was started on
tamsulosin during his hospitalization with some effect.  He has
a follow-up appointment in the urology clinic.
.
# Focal mesenteric thickening on CT scan:
His abdominal exam was benign and he did not complain of
abdominal pain.  The general surgery service was consulted and
did not recommend any intervention.
.
# Dispo:
He was discharged to home with plans for home physical therapy
as he had previously had.  He was also set up for appointments
with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] pain clinic, urology, and neurology.

History of Present Illness:
74 yo M with history of BPH, HTN, s/p recent cervical
laminectomy fusion [**2176-8-24**] for cervical stenosis who presented
to the ED from rehabilitation facility when he was noted to be
febrile to 102.2, tachycardic and diaphoretic on routine vital
check.
.
The patient was discharged from orthopedic service to rehab on
[**2176-8-28**]. He was discharged in cervical collar and on
Ciprofloxacin for treatment of UTI. Per family, the patient was
feeling well until 3 days prior to admission, when he complained
of trouble sleeping at night. The next day he started feeling
lightheaded. He has been feeling weak and was complaining of SOB
for several days. They also report that he has not been able to
eat due to shortness of breath. Family reports minimal po
intake. Per family, he also has been more listless over the last
several days. Per nursing home notes, the patient has not had
adequate pain relief despite Percocet standing q6 hrs and prn q
4hrs. Per family, the patient's upper extremity weakness
initially improved following the surgery, but lately he has not
been able to lift his arms off the bed to wave.
.
In the ED, VS T 98.7 (then spiked to 101.6), HR 78, BP 160/96,
97% RA. CXR showed RLL and RML opacities interpreted as PNA vs.
atelectasis. The pateint received Metronidazole 500mg IV,
Levofloxacin 500mg IV, Acetaminophen (Liquid) 650mg, Morphine
2mg IV, Lorazepam 2mg IV, Metoprolol 5mg IV x 2, Vancomycin 1000
mg IV once, Zosyn 4.5 mg IV once. Shortly after receiving
morphine and Ativan, he was noted to be lethargic. ABG was
checked and was 7.33/85/100 on 2L NC (previous ABG 7.41/pCO2
39/pO2 49 in [**2176-1-31**]). He was placed on BiPAP 15/5 FiO2 0.5
in the ED for hypercapnea. Narcan was not given.
.
While in the ED, the patient was also evaluated by orthopedics.
The wound was examined and cleared. Orthopedics recommended C
spine films. Currently, he denies any chest pain and is asking
for a sleep medication.

spinal stenosis, abnormal fluid collection or pathological
enhancement. However, assessment of hemorrhage is limited.
.
[**2176-9-16**]: EMG Abnormal study. The electrophysiologic findings
are most consistent with a generalized, severe, chronic and
ongoing disorder of motor neurons or their axons, affecting the
cervical, lumbar, and thoracic regions; however, severe, chronic
and ongoing cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral
polyradiculopathies could also give rise to these
electrophysiologic findings. There is no evidence for a
generalized polyneuropathy, for a generalized myopathy, or for a
pre- or post-synaptic disorder of neuromuscular transmission.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypercapnic respiratory failure: This was felt to be a
combination of neuromuscular failure c-spine disease and ALS. He
completed a course of antibiotics (Vancomycin and Zosyn) for
pneumonia. s/p trach and PEG, stable on ventilatory settings.
Vent settings at discharge: AC Vt 450, 0.4 FiO2, RR 10 PEEP 5.
He was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] Rehab and will further
work on means to regain some of his voice while at rehab.
.
# ALS: recent diagnosis during this admission, He was started on
Rilutek per neuro recs.
.
# Labile BP: The patient's BP was initially very difficult to
manage, ranging from 60s/30s to SBP 200s. He was originally
treated with IVFs and pressors. The patient was able to mentate
with sBP in the 60s and BP improved upon awakening and with
decreased sedation. The patient's BP has been stable on
stimulation and midodrine. On the day of discharge, BP ranged
from 70-150; however, patient asymptomatic.
.
# Pain: Adequate control with lidocaine patch, fentanyl patch,
gabapentin. PRN Morphine and PRN Ibuprofen. Gabapentin dose at
discharge increased to 1200 TID.
.
# S/p cervical laminectomy. Patient with pain and weakness. Was
originally wearing a hard cervical collar at all times, and
changed to [**Location (un) 2848**] J collar which should be worn when out off
bed/changing position. Per recs, may be taken off while lying in
bed. Continue pain medications as needed.
.
# Fever. The patient was originally febrile with CXR showing RML
and RLL infiltrate vs atelectasis. He was originally started on
antibiotics and found to have an eosinophilia which was
attributed to zosyn. All cultures including BAL were negative
(except for yeast from likley colonization). Antibiotics were
eventually discontinued and the patient remained afebrile.
.
# PPX. Heparin SQ and PPI while NPO.
.
# FEN. s/p PEG, continue tube feeds.
# Code. Full.

.
# OUTSTANDING ISSUES at DISCHARGE:
1. Per orthopedics, he will need repeat films of C-spine (AP and
lat) once he is at rehab.
2. As he is transferring care to [**Hospital1 336**], he will need neurology
follow-up for his ALS.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination at the time of
admission revealed vital signs with heartrate of 74, blood
pressure 134/67, respiratory rate 18.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat, pupils equally round and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements intact.  Mucous membranes moist, full

bowel sounds, obese.  Groin, no bruits, no bleeding.
Extremities, positive edema.  Pulses are palpable
bilaterally.  Skin is ecchymotic at intravenous sites.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data at the time of transfer
revealed white count 8.2, hematocrit 34.2, platelets 195,
sodium 138, potassium 4.5, chloride 101, carbon dioxide 32,
BUN 18, creatinine 1.3, glucose 118, CPK prior to admission
on [**462-12-13**], on [**413-12-14**], on [**394-12-17**]
and on [**394-12-19**].  Troponins are all less than .04
except for on [**12-13**], they were 0.05.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory, please see catheterization report
or full details.  In summary the catheterization report
showed normal left main with left anterior descending 80%
occlusion, circumflex 70% occlusion and right coronary artery
totally occluded.  Post cardiac catheterization,
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted.  In summary, the
patient was accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting at a
later date following a complete workup including carotid
dopplers, pulmonary function tests, and echocardiogram to
assess left ventricular function as well as his mitral
regurgitation and resolution of his right middle lobe
infiltrates as well as diuresis prior to his surgery.  The
patient was maintained on the Medical Service prior to his
surgery during his preoperative testing.  On [**12-20**], he
experienced an episode of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia.  At that time he was seen by the
electrophysiology service who recommended that the patient be
loaded with amiodarone and started on heparin.  On [**12-23**] the patient complained of abdominal pain.  Following his
complaint of abdominal pain he had decreasing level of
consciousness followed by a cardiac arrest during which he
had periods of asystole, lasting six to eight seconds.
During that time he was pulseless.  He did rule in for a
non-Q wave myocardial infarction following his cardiac
arrest.  A temporary pacing wire was placed and he was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for continued
monitoring prior to his coronary artery bypass grafting.

The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was further complicated by an
episode of ventricular tachycardia during which the patient
was pulseless.  This occurred on [**12-26**].  The patient
was shocked out of the ventricular tachycardia with 300
joules followed by ventricular pacing with the temporary wire
he had in place.  The following morning, [**12-27**], the
patient was brought to the Operating Room where he underwent
an off-pump coronary artery bypass graft times one with a
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending,
please see the operation report for full details.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well and he was transferred
from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit.  At the time of transfer, the patient's mean arterial
pressure was 70, central venous pressure was 12, he was
ventricularly paced at a rate of 70.  He had a propofol at 20
mcg/kg/min and Neosynephinre at 0.3 mcg/kg/min.  The patient
did well in the immediately postoperative period.  He
remained on his Neosynephrine infusion to keep his mean
arterial pressure greater than 70.  He remained intubated
throughout postoperative day #1 in anticipation of an
angioplasty to be done on postoperative day #1.

As stated, the patient was brought to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory on postoperative day #1.  At that
time his coronary arteries were again studied.  The
catheterization showed his left anterior descending to have
an 80% occlusion with competitive flow distally, circumflex
and obtuse marginal 1 to be 80% occluded and the right
coronary artery to be 100% occluded with proximal filling via
left to right collaterals.  His left internal mammary artery
to the left anterior descending was widely patent with normal
flow.  At that time he underwent an angioplasty of his obtuse
marginal 1 lesion.  The lesion was crossed and stented with
no residual lesion.  The patient tolerated the procedure
well, please see the catheterization report for full details.
Following the catheterization and stenting the patient was
transferred from the Catheterization Laboratory to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  Upon arrival the
patient's sedation was discontinued.  He was weaned from his
ventilator and ultimately extubated.  For the next 48 hours
the patient remained in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit, monitoring his hemodynamic stability and his
respiratory status.  On postoperative day #4 the patient was
transferred to Far 6 for continuing postoperative care and
cardiac rehabilitation.  Over the next several days the
patient remained on the Cardiothoracic Step Down Floor.  His
activity level was slowly increased with the aid of physical
therapy and the nursing staff.  He continued to be followed
by the Electrophysiology Service and on postoperative day #10
he was brought to the Electrophysiology Suite where he
underwent electrophysiology studies and automatic implanted
cardioverter defibrillator placement.  Please see
electrophysiology study report for full details.  The patient
remained on Cardiothoracic Step Down Floor for two additional
days at which time he was deemed stable and ready for
transfer to rehabilitation.

At the time of transfer to rehabilitation, the patient's
physical examination is as follows:  Vital signs temperature
97.7, heartrate 67, ventricularly paced, blood pressure
145/70, respiratory rate 18 and oxygen saturation 99% on 3
liters.  Weight preoperatively is 125 kg, at discharge is
121.8 kg.  Laboratory data on the day of discharge is white
count 9.5, hematocrit 28.7, platelets 273, PT 14, PTT 28.7,
INR 1.4.  Sodium 141, potassium 4.6, chloride 102, carbon
dioxide 31, BUN 24, creatinine 1.1, glucose 100.  On physical
examination he is alert and oriented times three, moves all
extremities and is conversant.  Respiratory, diffuse rhonchi
bilaterally, no rales.  Heartsounds, regular rate and rhythm.
Sternum is stable.  Incision with steri-strips, open to air,
clean and dry.  Abdomen is soft, nontender with normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm with 2 to 3+ edema and
palpable dorsalis pedis pulses.  The patient does complain of
pain in the right groin including the upper leg.  This pain
was noted preoperatively.  He had bilateral groin ultrasounds
which were negative for pseudoaneurysm.

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female
with a history of gastritis, hypertension and
hypercholesterolemia who was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service on
[**2145-5-6**] for the complaint of progressive chest pain.
The patient described a two to three month history of
progressive shortness of breath and substernal chest pain.
The patient stated that the chest pain originally occurred at
rest and reported that her episodes had become more severe
over the ensuing time.  The patient's episodes were
characterized by pain radiating to both arms that would
occasionally wake her up at night and lasted approximately 30
minutes in duration.  The patient was reportedly evaluated by
her primary care physician and was presumptively diagnosed
with gastritis; an esophagogastroduodenoscopy conducted on
[**2145-4-13**] demonstrated mild gastritis which resulted in
outpatient treatment with Maalox and Protonix prn.  The
patient continued to demonstrate worsening symptoms,
resulting eventually in a MIBI stress test on [**5-5**] which
demonstrated severe lateral wall reversible defects.  The
patient was subsequently advised to come immediately to the
Emergency Department at [**Hospital6 256**],
where she was noted to have ST depressions in leads 2, AVF,
V5 and 6 and an old T wave inversion in leads 1 and AVL.  The
patient was subsequently started on heparin and nitroglycerin
drip which brought immediate relief of her chest pain
symptoms and she was subsequently admitted to the Medicine
Service on [**5-6**] for further evaluation and treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension; hypercholesterolemia;
colon cancer; status post colectomy; breast cancer;
peripheral vascular disease; gastritis; status post right
total hip repair; status post thyronodular excision.

HOME MEDICATIONS:  Sinemet; Levo Carbidopa; Lipitor;
Atenolol; Norvasc; Hydrochlorothiazide; Protonix; Benicar;
Timolol; Maalox; Tylenol; Multivitamin; calcium; fish oil.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Widowed and lives in [**Location 1439**] [**State 350**]
with daughter, formerly worked as a secretary and is now
retired.  No smoking and no alcohol history.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]
Service on [**2145-5-6**].  Initial inpatient therapy
included Aspirin, statins, heparin, and Nitroglycerin drip,
on which regimen the patient was noted to have significant
relief of her chest pain.  Cardiac catheterization performed
on [**2145-5-7**] demonstrated three vessel coronary artery
disease, moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate diastolic
ventricular dysfunction, and mild systolic ventricular
dysfunction.  A 30 cc intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted
without complication through the course of the procedure.
The patient's ejection fraction was noted to be approximately
50%.  Following catheterization, the patient was admitted to
the Cardiac Care Unit for further evaluation and management.
The patient was subsequently evaluated by the Cardiothoracic
Surgery Service and scheduled for urgent coronary artery
bypass graft on [**2145-5-10**].  On [**5-10**], the patient
underwent an off pump coronary artery bypass graft times one
with anastomosis of the left internal mammary artery to the
left anterior descending with a plan for postoperative
stenting.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without
complications.  The patient's pericardium was left open;
lines placed including an arterial line, Swan-Ganz catheter,
and intra-aortic balloon pump; wires placed included
ventricular pacer wires; two slits including mediastinal,
right and left pleural tubes.  On transfer to the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit, the patient
demonstrated a mean arterial pressure of 92, central venous
pressure of 0, PAD of 8 and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1052**] of 18.  The patient
demonstrated a heartrate of 84 in normal sinus rhythm.  Drips
on transfer included Neo 0.7 and Propofol at 10.  In the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit, the patient progressed
well clinically and was successfully extubated on
postoperative day #1, [**5-11**].  The patient was returned to
the Catheterization Laboratory on postoperative day #1, where
stents were placed both to the circumflex and ramus.  On
postoperative day #2, the patient was cleared for transfer to
the floor, at which point her IABP was removed and her cordis
was changed to a triple lumen catheter without complication.
The patient was subsequently admitted to the Cardiothoracic
Service on direction of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**].  Postoperatively
the patient progressed well clinically.  Physical therapy
evaluation recommended the patient for [**Hospital 5735**]
rehabilitation following discharge, after which point the
patient was successfully screened for placement.  On
postoperative day #4, the patient's chest tubes were removed
without complication; subsequent chest x-ray demonstrated no
evidence of pneuomothorax.  The patient was successfully
advanced to a regular p.o. diet and was noted to have
adequate pain control via oral pain medications.  On
postoperative day #5, [**2145-5-15**], the patient was cleared
for discharge to a rehabilitation facility with instructions
for follow up.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is to be discharged to
an extended care facility with instructions for follow up.

STATUS ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

Echo:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function
is severely depressed (ejection fraction approximately 20
percent). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function
appears depressed. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation is
present but
cannot be quantified.

Chest CT:
IMPRESSION: 1) Extensive calcified pleural plaques consistent
with prior history of asbestos exposure. Right pleural effusion
with equivocal smooth enhancement of the right posterior lateral
pleural surface but without nodularity or other findings to
suggest mesothelioma. Correlation with pleural aspirate should
be considered.

2) Cardiomegaly and extensive coronary artery calcifications.

3) Borderline enlargement of the main pulmonary arteries suggest
a possible pulmonary artery hypertension.

4) Atelectasis at the left lung base and bronchiectasiss.

5) Extensive calcifications throughout the pancreas consistent
with chronic pancreatitis.

6) Small nodule in the left adrenal gland which possibly
represents an adenoma. However, this cannot be fully
characterized due to the lack of non- contrast series.

CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1) CHF
2) Calcified pleural plaques with a large right effusion or
pleural thickening. Further evaluation with CT scan is
reccommended to exclude malignant mesothelioma.


Brief Hospital Course:
This 80 y/o male with h/o CAD, DM, HTN, asbestosis was admitted
in fairly stable condition after a modest diuresis at the OSH
and the ED.  He was managed for an NSTEMI and acute CHF
exacerbation.  We spoke with his PCP and pulmonologist while he
was here, and obtained records from his cardiologist.
1.CHF:  This exacerbation was likely due to a combination of
ischemia(NSTEMI), severe HTN, and chronic systolic/diastolic
dysfunction.  We started him on Natrecor due to his underlying
CRI and he diuresed well with daily goals of 1L negative fluid
balance.  Also got an echo which confirmed an EF of approx 20%,
and 2+MR.  His SOB rapidly improved, but he was still using
minimal O2 upon D/C.  He is on 2LNC at home chronically.  He was
able to walk without O2 in the hospital though without dropping
his O2 sats.  Patient was instructed to not eat salty foods and
wife confirmed they have seen nutritionist before and have
handouts at home of appropriate and inappropriate foods.  He was
transitioned to Lasix on D/C at 20 mg/day, with instructions to
weigh himself and take extra Lasix iof his weight increases by 2
lbs in 1 day.  Hopefully this will keep him from slowly entering
CHF again.  He was on Lasix in the past, then Bumex, but for
now, we will try Lasix with the above instructions.  His
cardiologist or PCP may elect to alter this regimen depending on
his stability as an outpatient.
2.CAD:Known h/o coronary issues.  His EKG showed a new
incomplete LBBB and his cardiac enzymes were positive for MI.
No ST elevations seen.  His anginal equivalent is also SOB,
which was his primary complaint.  Initially started on ASA,
heparin, statin.  His Coreg was held due to initially tenuous
BP.  He was briefly on dopamine, but was quickly weaned from
this.  His CKs peaked in 200s and began trending down.  There
was question of whether this was result of demand ischemia or
not.  It was decided that he did not need a cath due to quick
improvement and no further symptoms.  The heparin was stopped
and his Coreg was restarted when his BP could tolerate it.  He
was sent home on coreg, but his diovan was not restarted as his
BP was in normal range without it.  Will need this monitored.
3.EP:He has a pacemaker that was placed after syncopal episode.
There were no issues with abnormal rhythms as an inpt.  Repeat
EKGs showed QRS narrowing to more normal value.

4.Renal: Initial creatinine was elevated and was reported that
he had CRI since a hospital admission last year.  Records
obtained showed a Cr baseline close to 3 after that admission,
but latest labs in records showed Cr of 2.0 on [**2146-6-6**].  He was
in this range throughout admission, with last value being 2.0.
He had good urine output on Natrecor here and no other issues
with his kidneys.

5.Asbestosis: CXR done which showed pleural plaque and effusion.
 CT of chest again showed plaques and effusion.  His
pulmonologist reported that he has had this effusion 3 times in
the past and fluid analysis was negative for malig mesothelioma.
 It was not retapped here due to this information.  We scheduled
a f/u appointment for him with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Also instructed him to
continue using his oxygen at home as before.

6. Initially had elevated WBC ct.  Possibly due to solumedrol,
but believed to be elevated before this as well.  No evidence of
infection was found.  COunt was followed, and gradually returned
to nL.

7.He was discharged stable and at his baseline respiratory
status, with close follow-up stressed to him and his family with
cardiologist, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] pulmonologist.  Plan for daily weights
and Lasix adjustment as appropriate will hopefully help keep him
from redeveloping volume overload.

ADDENDUM:

1.  EAR/NOSE/THROAT SYSTEM:  The patient underwent a video
swallow study on [**2124-11-29**] which revealed
mild-to-moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia.  He did accomplish
moist solids.  However, aspiration with thin liquids did
occur.  Aspiration precaution techniques were recommended to
the patient.  He will need a swallowing re-evaluation at his
rehabilitation center to reassess the situation.  This will
also indicate whether or not his diet can be changed back to
include thin liquids.

atrial fibrillation while hospitalized.  He is not currently
a candidate for anticoagulation given his recent
gastrointestinal bleed.  He was to follow up with his
cardiologist (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2201**]).  He was to be restarted on
aspirin on [**2124-12-18**].

3.  GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM:  The patient has had several
episodes of loose stools during the past two days.  This was
likely associated with the administration of a suppository on
[**2124-11-28**].  He has not complained of any abdominal
pain, nausea, or vomiting.  He has remained afebrile.  He was
on a recent antibiotic course with levofloxacin which he
discontinued a few days ago.

Although the likelihood for a Clostridium difficile infection
was relatively low, stool was sent for Clostridium difficile
toxin assays; the results of which are currently pending;
although, these will be followed up when the patient is
discharged to rehabilitation.  He did not have an elevated
white blood cell count associated with these episodes.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was to be discharged
with the medications as listed on Page 1.  The only change to
the previously listed medications in the Discharge Summary is
that his Lopressor was to be increased to 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
(rather than 37.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.).

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to follow
up with the following individuals.
1.  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], his primary care physician.
2.  Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1692**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1693**], with the [**Hospital 878**] Clinic.

ADDENDUM:
1.  Cardiovascular:  On the evening of [**2124-11-27**], the
patient was noted to have an episode of atrial fibrillation
with a rapid ventricular rate on telemetry.  He was given 25
mg of oral Lopressor for rate control.  This was found not to
have any effect on the patient's heart rate.  Subsequently, a
Valsalva maneuver was attempted, which successfully converted
the patient's heart rhythm back into sinus.  Since this
episode of atrial fibrillation, the patient has remained in
sinus rhythm on telemetry.  Given his recent upper
gastrointestinal bleed, the patient is not a candidate for
anticoagulation.  [**Hospital 75195**] medical management of his atrial
fibrillation will include only administering a beta blocker.
His Lopressor dose was increased from 25 mg twice a day to
37.5 mg twice a day.  During the patient's episode of atrial
fibrillation, he was completely asymptomatic.  He denied any
palpitations, chest pain or shortness of breath.

2.  Infectious disease:  The patient completed a seven day
course of ciprofloxacin for his urinary tract infection.  A
repeat urinalysis was checked on [**2124-11-28**], which
revealed no evidence of nitrite or leukocyte esterase or
bacteria.  He has not complained of any dysuria or hematuria
throughout his hospital stay.

3.  Speech and swallow:  The patient was noted to be coughing
with drinking liquids during his meals.  On [**2124-11-28**],
the patient underwent a bedside swallowing evaluation.  He
was found to be aspirating thin liquids and also possibly
aspirating nectar thick liquids.  His swallowing ability was
functional for soft solids.  Thus, he was recommended to
undergo a video swallowing study on [**2124-11-29**] to
further evaluate whether he is safe to drink liquids.  Prior
to the study being performed, the patient was not allowed to
have any liquids, however, he was allowed soft and moist
solids.  His medications were crushed in pureed food or given
intravenously to reduce aspiration risk.  At the time of this
dictation, the video swallowing study has not yet been
performed.

ADDITIONAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Oropharyngeal dysfunction resulting in aspiration of thin
liquids (video swallowing study currently pending).

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Locholest Light 4 gm p.o.b.i.d.
Colace 100 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Dulcolax suppository p.r.n.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.q.12h.
Lopressor 37.5 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d., to be started on [**2124-12-12**]
given the patient's recent gastrointestinal bleed.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will ultimately be discharged
to a skilled nursing facility, the name of which is not yet
known.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77-year-old man
with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft and multiple stents, history of
after a fall related to a multi-factorial gait disorder.  He
was performed and the patient was rehydrated.  The patient
did well until he developed hyponatremia during his stay with
the neurology service.  His sodium was found to be at 122.
He was thought to have hyponatremia secondary to the addition
of Hydrochlorothiazide to his medication regimen.  The renal
hyponatremia.  Throughout the course of his hospital stay,
the hyponatremia resolved.
On [**2124-11-23**], he had an episode of coffee ground emesis with
nausea.  An nasogastric lavage was performed which
demonstrated one liter of coffee grounds which did not clear
with lavage.  His hematocrit was also found to have decreased
from 38 to 32.  His systolic blood pressures also dropped
from 130 to 90.  The family noted about one month of nausea
which the patient experienced at night after eating heavy
meals and laying down to sleep.  He has also complained of a
decreased appetite over the past three to four weeks.  His
nausea was relieved by Zantac over-the-counter.  He has never
had a previous episode of coffee ground emesis.  He denies
any other melena or bright red blood per rectum.  He had a
history of stomach problems in his late 20's with a question
diagnosis of gastritis seen on a barium swallow.  He has no
known history of peptic ulcer disease or gastroesophageal
reflux disease.

On hospital day six, the patient was transferred to the
medical Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation.

6.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs
temperature 98.1, blood pressure 118/62, heart rate 71,
respirations 18, O2 saturation 99% on two liters.  General:
Alert, comfortable.  Neck:  Right IJ in place, noted to be
clean, dry and intact without erythema.  Lungs:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally with the exception of decreased
breath sounds at the basis.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate
and rhythm with a 4/6 systolic murmur at the right upper
sternal border.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds, soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  Notable for trace
edema in bilateral fingers, no evidence of lower extremity
edema.

PERTINENT LABS AND STUDIES:  White blood count 5.8,
hematocrit 28.9.  Platelets 133.  Sodium 139, potassium 3.7,
chloride 106, bicarbonate 25, BUN 22, creatinine 0.4.
Glucose 88.  Magnesium 1.8.  H. pylori negative.  Urinalysis
trace leukocyte esterase, occasional bacteria, 21 white blood
cells.

Troponin which peaks at 20 and most recently on [**2124-11-27**] was
4.5.

MR of the spine:  Limited examination though no definite
evidence of cord compression.

Chest x-ray:  No evidence of pneumonia.  Small bilateral
pleural effusions and atelectasis with compression/collapse
of the basilar left lung associated with an elevated left
hemi-diaphragm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Gastrointestinal.  On hospital day six the patient
developed coffee ground emesis.  He was found to have a
hematocrit drop from 36 to 32.  He was also found to be
slightly hypotensive.  Decision was made to transfer him to
the medical Intensive Care Unit for further care.  While in
the Intensive Care Unit, the patient underwent an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy which revealed Grade I esophagitis
in the middle third of the esophagus and lower third of the
esophagus.  Blood was also noted in the proximal bulb and
second part of the duodenum.  Epinephrine injection and
electrocautery were attempted but hemostasis was
unsuccessful.  The decision was made to consult
interventional radiology so that the patient could undergo a
mesenteric angiogram.

On [**2124-11-23**] the patient underwent a mesenteric angiogram which
also involved coil embolization of the gastroduodenal artery.
This was successfully completed.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well with no complications.  In addition to the
interventional radiology service, the general surgery service
was consulted regarding the patient's upper gastrointestinal
bleed.  The decision was made to defer surgery given that the
coil embolization of the patient's gastroduodenal artery was
successful.  On hospital day #9, the patient was continuing
to have no evidence of further rebleeding.  His hematocrit
was otherwise stable.  He did undergo and additional blood
transfusion on [**2124-11-26**] since his hematocrit was less than 30
in the setting of known coronary artery disease.  The post
transfusion hematocrit bumped appropriately and was 32.5.

In total, the patient received 6 units of packed red blood
cells.  The patient was continued on Protonix 40 mg
intravenous twice a day.  He was also advanced to a cardiac
diet without any difficulty.


The patient subsequently was noted to have dysphagia, and
bedside evalution was notable for aspiration of liquids. He
underwent Video Swallowing Study which was notable for recurrent
aspiration felt to be neurological in nature. Recommendations
were made for thickening and chin tuck which will be included in
his transfer orders.


2.  Cardiovascular.  The patient was also noted to have a
non-ST elevation myocardial infarction which was thought
secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of a
gastrointestinal bleed.  Throughout his entire hospital stay,
the patient did not complain of any chest pain or short of
breath.  His CK levels remained within normal limits, though
his Troponin levels did peak at 20 on [**2124-11-25**].  Since this
time, his Troponin's have been trending downward.  The
patient was continued on a beta-blocker for management of his
coronary artery disease.  He was not given any aspirin in
light of his gastrointestinal bleed.  He will likely be
restarted on an aspirin regimen in one to two weeks following
discharge. The patient also developed PAF w/ RVR which responded
to prn IV lopressor. Because of his recent UGIB anti-coagulation
will need to be deferred. The decision of when and if to initiate
anticoagulation will need to be discussed with both GI and
Cardiology.

3.  Renal.  The patient's hyponatremia resolved over the
course of his hospital stay.  He developed no neurological
symptoms.  His creatinine remained stable and on [**2124-11-27**] was
0.4.  His potassium and magnesium levels were repleted as
necessary.

4.  Pulmonary.  The patient was eventually weaned off his O2
requirement.  We encouraged him to use his incentive
spirometer to prevent atelectasis.  He did exhibit increased
secretions in his upper airway.  We instituted chest physical
therapy to aid in the patient's respiratory status.

5.  ID:  The patient was started on Levofloxacin 500 mg q day
for a urinary tract infection secondary to coag negative
staphylococcus.  He will be treated for a total of 7 days.

6.  Prophylaxis.  The patient was administered Protonix for
ulcer prophylaxis.  He was also placed on pneumatic boots for
prevention of deep vein thrombosis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed.  Status post coil
embolization of the gastroduodenal artery.
2.  Urinary tract infection.
3.  Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction.
4.  Multi-factorial gait disorder.
5.  Hyponatremia - now resolved.
6.  Coronary artery disease.
7.  History of cerebrovascular accident.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient's discharge medications
will be found on his page one form as well as on the
discharge addendum.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Skilled Nursing Facility to be which he
will be discharged will be mentioned in the discharge
addendum.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old male with
complex cardiac history including coronary artery disease,
status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2104**] with
multiple percutaneous interventions, Instent stenosis as well
as brachytherapy, congestive heart failure, ejection fraction
of 42%, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gastrointestinal bleed,
CVA, weakness, dementia.  The patient originally presented to
the hospital on [**2125-11-9**] with complaints of slow
onset of left shoulder pain, about [**4-1**] that radiated to the
back associated with shortness of breath, but without nausea,
vomiting or palpitations; somewhat similar to his past
angina.  Patient was given aspirin at home and brought to the
Emergency Room by EMS.

In the Emergency Room, he received nitropaste, Lopressor,
morphine, tramadol and had some improvement in his symptoms.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for a lack of fevers and
chills, non-productive cough with a head cold without
shortness of breath.  Positive peripheral burning neuropathy,
no dysuria, no hematuria, no sick exposures, no lower
extremity edema, no orthopnea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
    bypass graft in [**2104**] (graft right saphenous vein graft to
    left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to ramus to
    OM and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending
    artery), complicated by Instent restenoses of the
    saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending in [**2117**],
    saphenous vein graft to ramus and OM in [**2121-10-22**]
    with subsequent stent placement which was then further
    complicated by Instent stenoses treated by percutaneous
    transluminal coronary angioplasty and brachytherapy in
    [**2120**].  Last cardiac catheterization was [**2122-12-4**]
    which revealed significant native three vessel disease,
    with patent saphenous vein graft to left anterior
    descending with 40-50% Instent restenoses, saphenous vein

comparison with an electrocardiogram dated [**2124-12-7**],
the patient's electrocardiogram at the time of admission
appeared to be improved in terms of the ST segment, T wave
inversion were normalizing V2 to V6.  In relation with an
electrocardiogram done in [**2124-10-22**], the ST
depressions are new.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  By system:

1.  Cardiovascular:

Ischemia:  The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction at
the start of his admission.  It was thought that his initial
shoulder pain was more related to a pulmonary process versus
a cardiac process.  He subsequently was maintained on
aspirin, beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor, doses of which were
variable throughout his hospital course based on his blood
pressure and other ongoing medical issues. It was told to us
that patient does not tolerate statins or Plavix and he was
not maintained on these medications.

Pump:  Patient had an echocardiogram on this admission that
showed an ejection fraction of 40-45% consistent with
systolic congestive heart failure.  His hospital course was
notable for increasing blood pressures 200/100s soon after
his admission with associated shortness of breath and oxygen
desaturations to 92% on a nonrebreather. This was thought to
be consistent with flash pulmonary edema. Patient was
diuresed subsequently hypotensive requiring a dopamine drip
and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for closer
monitoring, as well as a question aspiration event.  Patient
was treated with a nitroglycerin drip and Lasix and did have
an electrocardiogram that showed ST depressions in the
anterior lateral leads thought to be secondary to demand
ischemia.  He was subsequently in the Coronary Care Unit,
however, his course was then complicated by persistent
hypoxia from pneumonia and his blood cultures grew out 3-4
bottles of Methicillin sensitive staph aureus. Patient
required intubation on [**2124-11-22**] and was subsequently
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit Service after
an episode of hypotension with systolic blood pressures down
to the 60s.  He was subsequently started on a neo drip, given
fluid boluses, extubated on [**11-29**] and transferred to the
floor and then re-intubated on [**12-2**] in the setting of
an aspiration event, desaturations, when he was found
unresponsive with a weak cough.  At that time, the patient
was then transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit.
Subsequent details will be elaborated in the various
problems.

Rhythm:  The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm with
relative bradycardia during his [**Name (NI) 332**] Intensive Care Unit
stay which dates [**2125-12-2**] until the time of discharge
anticipated to be during the week of [**2125-12-10**].
Patient received amiodarone load and then followed by op
amiodarone while he was in the Coronary Care Unit and has
subsequently remained out of atrial fibrillation and atrial
flutter.  The issue of anticoagulation was raised, however,
given patient's multiple ongoing medical problems, bloody
sputum and history of CVA, as well as history of
gastrointestinal bleed, which was severe, patient was not
anticoagulated on this admission and that will need to be
re-addressed when the patient is more stable.

2.  Pulmonary:  Patient has had multiple complex problems
with his pulmonary status during this admission but to
summarize, he initially had hypoxia secondary to congestive
heart failure.  Subsequently, he was found to have difficulty
with swallowing and probable persistent aspiration with a
failed swallow evaluation on [**2125-11-14**] with
subsequent positive blood cultures for Methicillin Sensitive
Staph Aureus.  He was on several antibiotic courses including
initial levofloxacin and Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia
which was started on [**2125-11-12**] and discontinued on
[**2125-11-21**].  Subsequently he was empirically started
on Zosyn for potential pseudomonal nosocomial pneumonia, as
well as vancomycin on the [**11-16**] for gram positive
cocci, however, when he had neck gene analysis for the
Infectious Disease Service and was found to have
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, he was changed
to a course of four weeks of Oxicillin and 14 days of
levofloxacin per Infectious Disease recommendations.  His
course of Oxicillin is due to end on [**2125-12-12**].  He
will complete his levofloxacin at the same time.

Patient had multiple intubations and extubations during this
admission.  It is unclear what the precipitants of his
worsening hypoxia were during all the various events,
although, aspiration seemed to play a large role, as well as
congestive heart failure and these are the two main issues
for which he was treated while he was here.  Patient
underwent bronchoscopy on [**2125-11-23**] where he was found
to have a lingula with sputum plug.  He had a repeat
bronchoscopy on [**2125-12-6**] at which time he was found
to have very thick secretions mixed with blood in the ET
tube.  It was thought that the patient likely had a mucous
plug and some aspiration which then led to pulmonary edema
and congestive heart failure with bloody secretions.

Patient had difficulty weaning from the ventilator and
ultimately had a trachea on [**2125-12-7**].  Subsequently
he was able to come off of the ventilator and is currently
doing well from a respiratory prospective, however, he does
require at least q. 4 hour suctioning of his thick bloody
secretions which are thought to be due to congestive heart
failure, as well as his pneumonia.

Patient also had a thoracentesis of about 800 cc of straw
colored fluid on [**2125-12-3**] which improved his
breathing parameters and culture data from that fluid was
negative.

3.  Neurological:  Patient has had a chronic neurological
condition over the past six months to one year over which
time he has had a function decline and is wheelchair bound at
home.  He was seen and followed by Neurology multiple times
during this hospitalization.  It is thought that he may have
some sort of neurological degenerative disorder at baseline.
He definitely has a sensory polyneuropathy and he had an EMG
during this hospitalization on [**2125-12-5**] consistent
with ICU polyneuropathy, as well as a mild myopathy.  Patient
will need a Neurology follow-up as an outpatient for further
evaluation.  There was some talk of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**],
however, this was then thought to be unlikely and further
diagnostic work-up was not pursued along these lines.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  Patient did have an ileus during this
hospital course and has been continued on an aggressive bowel
regimen.  He had no subsequent problems with this issue.  He
also had a G tube placed by Gastrointestinal on [**2125-11-26**] and tolerates his tube feeds at goal at this point.

5.  Anemia:  Patient has a history of anemia, as well as a
history of gastrointestinal bleed.  He was transfused to
maintain his hematocrit above 30 during his hospital course.

6.  IV access:  Patient had multiple central lines and A
lines during this hospitalization.  He currently has a PICC
line in place that was placed on [**2125-12-7**] by
Interventional Radiology.

7.  Prophylaxis:  Patient was maintained on subcutaneous
heparin prophylaxis, Protonix and a bowel regimen during his
hospital course.

8.  Code:  Patient's code status is full code.

9.  Disposition:  Patient is being screened for
rehabilitation at this time.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 41-year-old male who
presented with new shortness of breath in early [**Month (only) **] of this
year.  An echocardiogram at an outside hospital showed new
dilated cardiomyopathy.

He first noted symptoms on approximately the [**Hospital1 107**] Day
weekend.  He described his symptoms as similar to asthmatic
symptoms.  This progressed to severe orthopnea, a symptom he
had no previously had causing him to sit upright and gasp for
breath at night.  He used his friend's albuterol nebulizers
with minimal improvement.  He denies lower extremity edema.
His shortness of breath at this point was severely limiting
his activity, walking 20 to 30 feet with severe dyspnea.  He
felt better leaning forward.  He also describes decreased
appetite.

At the beginning of [**Month (only) **] he saw his primary care physician
who felt he was having an asthma exacerbation and gave him
intravenous Solu-Medrol, and the patient relayed a vague
story of going into sinus tachycardia with a heart rate in
the 120s, a fingerstick in the 500s, been sent to the
Emergency Department and admitted to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital.
A chest x-ray showed a question of a left upper lobe
pneumonia.  He was given intravenous antibiotics; ceftriaxone
and azithromycin.  He was discharged from that hospital on
[**7-7**].  An echocardiogram during that admission showed
global hypokinesis, 4-chamber dilatation, an ejection
fraction of 10% to 15%.  There were no previous
echocardiograms.

The patient denies antecedent upper respiratory infection or
recent diarrheal illness.  No rash.  No joint pains.  Denies
a history of exertional chest pain, previous orthopnea, or
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or lower extremity edema.

In the week between discharge from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital and
admission to [**Hospital1 69**] he felt
better with decreased dyspnea on exertion, increased exercise
tolerance, and decreased lower extremity edema.  His blood
pressure previously had been 130s to 190s; he would take it
at work.  His cholesterol status is unknown.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy.
2.  Moderate mitral regurgitation.
3.  Global hypokinesis.
4.  Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.
5.  Elevated liver function tests.
6.  Asthma; no previous steroids.
7.  Pneumonia, status post ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Azmacort, NPH insulin 25 units
q.a.m. and 10 units q.p.m., a course of Ceftin (ended on
[**7-14**]).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives in [**Location (un) 23708**].  He has a human
immunodeficiency virus positive partner (female), positive
tobacco history times 20 years, previous heavy drinker (now
social), very remote cocaine use.

FAMILY HISTORY:   One uncle with coronary artery disease and
a sister with Grave's disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Pulse of 114, blood
pressure of 122/88, 98% on room air. In general, he was a
large man, in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat showed extraocular muscles were intact.  Pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  The oropharynx was
clear without lesions, 10 cm of jugular venous distention in
the neck.  Lungs were clear to auscultation without crackles;
however, decreased air movement was noted bilaterally.  Heart
was fourth heart sound and first heart sound and second heart
sound regular without murmurs.  The abdomen was obese.
Sacral and abdominal wall edema.  Bowel sounds were present.
It was soft.  Extremities showed 4+ edema, warm.  Neurologic
examination was nonfocal.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell
count of 9.7, hematocrit of 39, mean cell volume of 88,
platelets of 251.  Blood urea nitrogen of 16, creatinine
of 0.8, glucose of 168.  AST of 79, ALT of 340,
thyroid-stimulating hormone of 0.9, alkaline phosphatase
of 186, albumin of 3.2, total bilirubin of 1.2.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Liver ultrasound from the outside
hospital showed fatty infiltrate, no ascites, bilateral
pleural effusions, normal portal flow.

Transthoracic echocardiogram at the outside hospital on
[**7-6**] showed dilated left atrium of 5.6 cm, dilated left
ventricle with severe global hypokinesis, ejection fraction
of 10% to 15%, moderate mitral regurgitation, dilated right
ventricle with moderate global dysfunction, mild tricuspid
regurgitation, pulmonary artery pressure in the 30s.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was noted to be in severe
heart failure with dilated cardiomyopathy based on the
outside hospital records, the etiology of which was unclear.

He was sent to the catheterization laboratory which revealed
a middle left anterior descending artery lesion of 80%,
status post stent.  The right coronary artery was totally
occluded.  The left circumflex had a moderate ostial lesion
which was not intervened upon.  His pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was 35 mmHg to 40 mmHg.  His cardiac index was
1.4 L/kg/min/m2.

After catheterization, the patient was taken to the Coronary
Care Unit with an intra-aortic balloon pump and was diuresed
approximately 15 liters in the Coronary Care Unit with
intravenous Lasix.  He was transferred back to the Cardiology
Service for continued diuresis.  He was started on a heart
failure regimen of captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d., Lasix 120 mg
p.o. b.i.d., Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d., carvedilol 3.125 mg
p.o. b.i.d.  He was also started on a statin, Lipitor 10 mg
p.o. q.d.

He was seen by the Electrophysiology Service for the
possibility of receiving a prophylactic automatic internal
cardioverter-defibrillator.  Given the fact that this was not
an ischemic cardiomyopathy, it was felt that it was not
indicated at this point.

2.  DIABETES:  He was continued on his diabetic regimen.

3.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  Electrolytes were
repleted on a p.r.n. basis given his aggressive ongoing
diuresis.

4.  DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient remained on the
Cardiology Service as of [**7-18**].  An addendum to this
Discharge Summary will be dictated by the incoming intern.

Previous biopsies:    [**Numeric Identifier 43192**]  FS R 4 LYMPH NODE.
DIAGNOSIS:
FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT
FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING
The following tests (antibodies) were performed: HLA-DR, FMC-7,
Kappa, Lambda, CD antigens 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 19, 20, 23, 45.
RESULTS:
Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize lymphocyte yield.
B cells comprise 50% of lymphoid gated events, are polyclonal,
and do not express aberrant antigens.
T cells comprise 39% of lymphoid gated events and express mature
lineage antigens.

INTERPRETATION
Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic
immunophenotypic features of involvement by a T- or B-cell
lymphoproliferative disorder are not seen in specimen.
Correlation with clinical findings and morphology (see
S09-[**Numeric Identifier **]) is recommended. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may
not detect all lymphomas as due to topography, sampling or
artifacts of sample preparation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the cardiology service with NSTEMI
troponin 8 setting of known chronic systolic congestive heart
failure. He remained stable on intravenous therapy. The
following day he [**Known lastname 1834**] cardiac catheterization which
revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease - please
see result section for details. Given that his coronary anatomy
was more suitable for surgical revascularization, cardiac
surgery was consulted and further evaluation was performed. In
anticipation for surgery, Plavix was subseqently held. An
echocardiogram was notable for moderate mitral regurgitation and
an ejection fraction of 20% - see result section for further
details. Carotid ultrasound found normal internal carotid
arteries while vein mapping revealed suitable saphenous vein.
Given chest x-ray findings revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy,
the pulmonary service was consulted and a chest CT scan was
obtained which showed marked symmetric lymphadenopathy of the
mediastinum and the hila. Lymph node biopsy was recommended
along with bronchoscopy/bronchoaveolar lavage. Preoperative
course was otherwise uneventful, and he remained stable on
intravenous therapy.

On [**4-12**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] coronary artery bypass
grafting and mitral valve repair, along with excision of
paratracheal lymph node and bronchoscopy with bronchoaveolar
lavage. Please see operative notes for details. Given his
inpatient stay was greater than 24 hours, Vancomycin was given
for perioperative antibiotic coverage.  He was transferred in
critical but stable condition to the surgical intensive care
unit, on inotropes and vasoactive medications.  A bilateral
alveolar lavage was performed and a subsequent gram stain
revealed gram negative rods and gram positive cocci, which he
was placed on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage until the
culture was finalized.  The culture revealed oropharyngeal flora
and antibiotics were discontinued. He was weaned off inotropes
and vasoactive medications, started on lasix for diuresis, and
was extubated on post operative day two.  He remained in te
intensive care unit for blood glucose management and [**Last Name (un) 387**] was
consulted.  When blood glucose stable he was transferred to the
floor were he received the remainder of his care.  Physical
therapy worked with him on strength and mobilty.  He was
educated on diabetes and was ready for discharge home on post
operative day seven with services.

ADDENDUM:  Under cardiovascular, please add that the patient
was discharged with amiodarone due to three events of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (at most four beats) on
the night of [**2167-7-21**].  Per consultation with Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 86**] of the elctrophysiology service, it was not thought
that he that he required an automatic internal
cardioverter-defibrillator due
to the fact that his cardiomyopathy is global without apparent
post infarct areas of scar.

Also initiated was a formal full workup for a possible heart
transplant candidacy.  Some of these results of this workup
were still pending.

Under fluids/electrolytes/nutrition, please add that the
patient was aggressively diuresed while in the hospital and
discharged and nearly euvolemic.

Under discharge condition, please add that the patient was
discharged in stable condition to home with a Holter monitor
and an appointment to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks and
instructions to keep a diary of his daily urine output.  His
dental records were also requested to be faxed to
Dr.[**Name (NI) 7878**] office concerning a tooth abscess.

Under medications on discharge, he was discharged on
captopril 75 mg p.o. t.i.d., atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d.,
carvedilol 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d., Lasix 120 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
insulin as directed, enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.,
Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d., spironolactone 25 mg p.o. q.d.,
amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.d.

Also, under laboratories, also include human immunodeficiency
virus antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antigen and
hepatitis B surface antibody were negative.  Hepatitis C was
negative.  VCV titer was positive.  Cytomegalovirus was
negative.  Toxo was negative.

Under physical examination, add that on discharge the
patient's extremities had minimal edema in the left lower
extremity and 1 to 2+ edema in the right lower extremity.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year old female
with a history of noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus and
congestive heart failure who presented to the outside
hospital on [**2191-10-23**], with complaints of increasing lethargy,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lower
extremity swelling over two weeks and was found to be in
diabetic ketoacidosis with a fasting blood sugar of 700. The
patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.

Within 24 hours of admission, she was thought to be volume
overloaded from overt congestive heart failure and was
started on Captopril and Lasix for diuresis.  She then
developed relative hypotension with a blood pressure of
80/40.  The echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of
20% with hypokinesis and apical akinesis. Heparin was started
for apical akinesis.

Bilateral thoracentesis was performed for approximately 1500
ccs of fluid removed with symptomatic relief.  On [**2191-10-27**],
Captopril was discontinued and Dopamine was initiated to aid
with hypotension and diuresis.  On [**2191-10-31**], Dopamine was
weaned off and Captopril was restarted.  The patient was
noted to be hyponatremic with a sodium of 121 and lethargic
on examination.

On [**2191-11-1**], she again developed hypotension with a systolic
blood pressure of 70 to 80.  Lasix and Captopril were held
without improvement. Over the next few days, she remained
relatively hypotensive and the plan was for transfer to [**Hospital1 1444**] for cardiac catheterization.
Of note, she had elevated white blood cell count on admission
to the outside hospital.  She was started on Ciprofloxacin
for a urinary tract infection.

She was admitted directly to the CCU at [**Hospital1 190**].  At that time, she was pain free with minimal
dyspnea.  No complaints aside from low back pain which is
chronic.  The son was present for translating as the patient
speaks only Armanian.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Chronic cervical spine disease.
4.  Congestive heart failure.
5.  Right cataract.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, Aspirin and nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  K-Dur 20 meq p.o. q.d.
4.  Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  NPH insulin.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unavailable.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No drugs, alcohol or tobacco.  She lives
with her son.  She is Armanian speaking.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission revealed
temperature 97.5, blood pressure 98/50, pulse 80, respiratory
rate 16, oxygen saturation 97% on two liters via nasal
cannula.  In general, this is an elderly female in no acute
distress.   Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - normocephalic
and atraumatic.  The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.
The oropharynx is clear.  The neck reveals no
lymphadenopathy, jugular venous pressure was 12 centimeters,
trachea midline.  Pulmonary - decreased breath sounds at both
bases approximately one fourth of the lung fields, minimal
rales, no wheeze.  Cardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm,
S1 and S2 and S3, no murmur.  The abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities were warm, 1+ pitting edema
with pulses intact.  Central nervous system - the patient was
alert and oriented times three, conversant, nonfocal motor
and sensory examination.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count 10.9,
hematocrit 34.6, platelets 176,000.  Sodium 126, potassium
3.7, chloride 88, CO2 34, blood urea nitrogen 21, creatinine
0.6, glucose 220.  Partial thromboplastin time 39, INR 2.5.

Electrocardiogram on [**2191-10-23**], showed normal sinus rhythm at
120 with right axis deviation, intraventricular conduction
delay, 1.[**Street Address(2) 2811**] elevation V2 with 1.[**Street Address(2) 2811**]
depressions in leads I, aVL, V5 and V6.  There were small Q
waves in the lead III, as well as T wave inversion.

On [**2191-11-6**], electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at
80 beats per minute with right axis deviation and
intraventricular conduction delay.  There was less than 1.[**Street Address(2) 27948**] depression in lead V6.

Chest x-ray showed right pleural effusion.  Echocardiogram
showed ejection fraction of less than 20% and apical
thrombus, global left ventricular hypokinesis and apical
akinesis.  There was moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 75 year old female with noninsulin
dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia and congestive heart failure who
presented with diabetic ketoacidosis and non ST elevation
myocardial infarction.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for management of cardiogenic versus
hypovolemic shock.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular - Coronary arteries - On the basis of
electrocardiogram, she was felt to have had a non ST
elevation myocardial infarction, probably a week or two prior
to presentation to the outside hospital.  Troponin was 3.0 on
admission to the outside hospital although the CK MB was
normal.  There was no history of chest pain.

Given no evidence for immediately recent ischemia and the low
likelihood of significant improvement, even with
revascularization, it was felt that the risks of cardiac
catheterization outweighed the potential benefits.

Allergies to Aspirin was addressed and appears to be actually
a fear of gastritis, and thus daily Aspirin was initiated.
She was continued on Lipitor.

Congestive heart failure/hemodynamics - The patient presented
with congestive heart failure and hypotension requiring
Levophed for pressure support.  This was weaned three days
after admission.  The patient remained relatively hypotensive
with systolic pressures ranging from 75 to 99.  Saline
boluses were administered and the systolic blood pressure
increased to 91 to 115.

However, urine output remained low and there was worsening
congestive heart failure with oxygen saturation decreasing to
96% on four liters.  Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d. was started.
On [**2191-11-9**], she was considered stable and transferred from
the CCU to the cardiology floor.

Repeat chest x-ray showed worsening bilateral pleural
effusions and congestive heart failure.  Therapeutic
thoracentesis was not performed because this had been already
done at the outside hospital and fluid had rapidly
reaccumulated.  Instead, gentle diuresis was attempted with
Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. Her fluid balance was slightly
negative for several consecutive days on this dose but her
weight slowly increased daily.  Her lower extremity edema did
not improve appreciably.

She also became more alkalotic as well as hyponatremic to the
low 120s although she did not exhibit mental status changes.
Her blood pressure remained tenuous at one point measuring
74/50 four days prior to discharge.

In general though, her blood pressure was about 90 to 110
over 60 to 70.  Her oxygen saturation was stable at 94 to 96%
on four liters.  The day before discharge Lasix was
discontinued and low dose Bumetanide was started.  We never
initiated therapy with beta blocker or ace inhibitor because
of her hypotension.  She did remain on Digoxin and we
increased her dose to 0.25 mg/0.125 mg p.o. q.d. on
alternating days.  Her Digoxin level at this dose was 1.6 to
1.8.

Rate and rhythm - There were no acute issues although she
maintained a rapid heart rate averaging in the 90s most
likely due to intravascular volume depletion, poor cardiac
output.

2.  Pulmonary - The patient was maintained on oxygen by nasal
prong at three to four liters.  She denied dyspnea except on
rare occasion.  When symptomatic, she was treated with
nebulized Albuterol and Atrovent with relief.  Further
information on her pulmonary course is listed above under
subcategory congestive heart failure.

3.  Hematology - The patient was heparinized for documented
apical thrombus and apical akinesis seen on echocardiogram at
the outside hospital.  She was started on Coumadin for a goal
INR of 2.0 to 3.0.  She was anemic and was started on Epogen
8,000 units subcutaneous q.week as well as Iron Sulfate 325
mg p.o. b.i.d.

4.  Infectious disease - The patient presented with urinary
tract infection and was treated with Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o.
q.d. for one week course.  Repeat urinalysis check at the end
of her antibiotic course was perfectly normal.

5.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - As documented above,
hyponatremia and alkalosis limited the extent to which we
could diurese this patient.  In addition, she tends to become
hypomagnesemic so oral supplements were administered as well
as periodic intravenous magnesium repletion.  Her potassium
tends to run high probable due to her Aldactone.  She was
admitted on oral supplements of potassium and these were
discontinued.

6.  Endocrine - We continued the patient on her NPH insulin
and covered her with regular insulin sliding scale.

7.  Prophylaxis - Heparin and Coumadin for deep vein
thrombosis prophylaxis were given as well as Protonix for
gastrointestinal prophylaxis.

8.  Code Status - Lengthy discussions were held with the
patient and her son who acted as translator.  The patient
wishes to be DNR/DNI but will accept intravenous pressors.
She wishes to reverse her Code Status to full code in the
event that a procedure such as a cardiac catheterization is
performed so that she could be resuscitated if there are
complications with the procedure.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Satisfactory.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  She was discharged to [**Hospital 13698**]
Rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q.d.

subcutaneous of regular insulin, 201-250 give four units,
251-300 give six units, 301-350 give eight units, 351-400
give ten units, greater than 400 give twelve units and call
medical doctor.
12. Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg p.o. b.i.d.
13. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q4-6hours p.r.n.
14. Nebulized Albuterol and Atrovent p.r.n.

SPECIFIC DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Her INR should be checked frequently q.d. over the next
several days as Coumadin was only started several days before
discharge.  Goal INR is 2.0 to 3.0.
2.  Sodium, magnesium and potassium should be checked
frequently.  If sodium is less than 125, consider decreasing
her diuretic.  If potassium is less than 4.0, provide oral
supplementation.  Her standing potassium was discontinued
immediately prior to discharge.  Her potassium level was 5.0
on the day prior to discharge.  Magnesium supplementation
should be provided to keep magnesium greater than 2.0.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Severe congestive heart failure.
2.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
3.  Hypotension.
4.  Urinary tract infection.
5.  Hyponatremia.

ADDENDUM:  The expected date of discharge, which was
originally that of [**2191-11-15**], the patient was found to
be lethargic, not responsive to voice, but responsive to
painful stimulus.  A chest x-ray was performed.  This was
shown to be unchanged from prior x-ray on the [**12-9**]
that showed large bilateral pleural effusion as well as
severe pulmonary edema.  Arterial blood gas showed a pH of
7.37, PCO2 of 52 and PO2 of 158 on 100% nonrebreather.  Her
oxygen saturation was 98%.  It was thought that her lethargy
was secondary to hypercarbia.  The patient's son was notified
of her decreased mental status and it was decided to not
pursue any aggressive measures including thoracentesis or
intubation.  In fact with no treatment the patient improved
and her mental status gradually returned to baseline by that
evening.

On the following day the [**11-16**] the patient was at
baseline mental status and was discharged to rehabilitation.

There were several changes in her discharge medications.
First her Coumadin was decreased to 2 mg po q.h.s.  This was
done, because her INR on the day of discharge was 3.3.  The
goal INR is from 2.0 to 3.0.  In addition, her Digoxin was
decreased to 0.125 mg po q.d.  Due to her low sodium level
the patient should have daily fluid restrictions to
approximately 750 cc po.

She is discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Left carotid stenosis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 63 year old female
with coronary artery disease status post catheterization with
stent of the mid left anterior descending on [**2137-6-18**], who
presented on [**2137-7-15**], for elective carotid
catheterization.  In the past, the patient has had a series
of flashing lights in her left and right eyes which were
possibly attributed to carotid disease.  A duplex of the
carotids was obtained on [**2137-5-29**], which showed significant
plaque of 80 to 99% in the left.  A stenosis of 40 to 59% was
identified in the right.  The lesion in the left internal
carotid artery was stented this morning.  The final residual
was 20% with normal flow.

The patient did have some mid segment spasm of the internal
carotid artery that improved with TNG through the sheath.
The patient was neurologically intact throughout the case.

She was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for postoperative
care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post stent on [**2137-6-18**],
of the mid left anterior descending.
2.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft times four in
[**2118**].
3.  Status post myocardial infarction times three in [**2106**],
[**2109**] and [**2118**].
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Diverticulosis status post gastrointestinal bleed.
7.  Carpal tunnel syndrome.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Early coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Blood pressure 110 to 120 over 50 to
53; heart rate 45 to 50; saturation 99% on room air.  In
general, alert and oriented in no acute distress.  Cardiac:
Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2.  No murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Groin:  Right groin site without hematoma or bruit.
Extremities with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  One plus
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  Neurological:  Pupils are
equal, round and reactive to light, 3 millimeters to 2
millimeters.  Extraocular movements intact without nystagmus.
Symmetric but normal sensation in all three branches of the
trigeminal nerve.  Tongue:  Midline, clear phonation,
elevation of palate is symmetrical.

LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count 7.9,

35.5, platelets 177.  Sodium 139, potassium 3.3, chloride
103, bicarbonate 29, BUN 16, creatinine 0.7.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Status post left internal carotid catheterization.  The
patient was neurologically intact and doing well following
the procedure.  All blood pressure medications were held with
a target blood pressure goal of 120 to 170.  The patient
required a Neo-synephrine drip to maintain her blood pressure
near 120.

On the evening of [**2137-7-15**], and during the day on
[**2137-7-16**], multiple attempts were made to wean the patient
off the Neo-synephrine drip.  When this was done, her
systolic blood pressures would drop to around 100.  She was
also given multiple boluses of normal saline in an attempt to
bring up her blood pressure.

Throughout this time, the patient was asymptomatic without
dizziness or lightheadedness.  She was up in a chair and
walking around her hospital room.  The Neo-synephrine was
successfully weaned off at 01:00 a.m. on [**2137-7-17**].  The
patient's blood pressure once weaned off the drip remained
between 110 and 115.  The patient was continued on aspirin
and Plavix throughout the admission.

2.  Possible sleep apnea:  When asleep, the patient has
episodes when she pauses in her breathing and her saturations
drop.  Saturations return immediately when she takes a deep
breath and resumes her normal breathing pattern.  Will have
her follow-up for this with her primary care physician.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   The patient was discharged to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post left internal carotid artery catheterization.
2.  Coronary artery disease status post stent on [**2137-6-18**],

Chief Complaint:
cold numb rt. leg below knee

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
LASER thrombectomy to atheromatous debris of both vessels
balloon angioplasty
cardiac cath


Past Medical History:
 67 y/o with hx. CAD s/p CABG [**2118**] (all grafts occluded), LAD
stenting [**2136**], PVD s/p Lt. carotid stenting [**2136**], PMR, HTN, HCL,
who presented with acute onset of N/V/D while at a casino last
evening. This was her anginal equivalent in the past, so she
became concerned for new MI. Shortly thereafter, she noted that
her legs felt weak, that her rt. foot was numb, white, and she
couldnt move it. She presented to the ED and was found to have a
cold, white, pulseless foot. [**Year (4 digits) **] sx. was consulted and felt
that she should go emergently to catheterization. Heparin gtt
was started. On evaluation by the intverventionalist fellow in
the ED, she had already regained some color of the foot, with
some blanching, and return of sensation to normal. Rt. DP and PT
were faintly dopplerable at this time.
.
In the cath lab (retro LFA to the coronaries and contralateral
PT and DP) she was found to have:
.
AO: 70% ulcerated vessels at the bifurcation
Renals: bilateral single vessels with rt. 90% lesion
Rt LE: CIA and EIA normal, CFA and SFA normal. Popliteal free of
disease. Rt. AT occluded mid vessel with PT occluded proximally
(both from the patent PA).
She underwent LASER thrombectomy catheter to atheromatous debris
of both vessels, and then balloon angioplasty to the same with
return of flow.
.
Coronary anatomy as follows:
LMCA normal
LAD previous stent patent, mid segment 70% lesion with
bifurcation D2
LCX: non-dominant without critical lesion; OM2 60% lesion after
bifurcation
RCA dominant with proximal occlusion; distal L to R collaterals
remain

Optiray 312 mL. She got a dose of mucomyst prior to prodcedure
and [**11-22**] normal saline gtt was started for planned total 2 L


Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use.

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 143/90 mm Hg while supine. Pulse was 73
beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 12 breaths/min.
Generally the patient was well developed, well nourished and
well groomed. The patient was oriented to person, place and
time. The patient's mood and affect were not inappropriate.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with
JVP of 6 cm. The carotid waveform was normal. There was no
thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis. The respirations were not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. The lungs were clear to ascultation
bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds
or rubs.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart sounds revealed a normal
S1 and the S2 was normal. There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or
gallops.
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis,
clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid

Chief Complaint:
Left lower lobe nodule

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2142-6-11**]: Left VATS converted to left anterior thoracotomy,
resection of superior segment of the left lower lobe,
mediastinal
lymph node dissection


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman who had undergone an x-ray
for shoulder pain that had disclosed bilateral lung
abnormalities.  A CT scan was performed and confirmed a solid
nodule in the superior segment of her left lower lobe highly
suspicious for malignancy as well as a bulla in the right lower
lobe with a thickened cyst wall also concerning for malignancy.
A PET scan was performed subsequent to the CT scan.  This showed
that the left lower lobe nodule showed an SUV of 16.4 as well as
a left hilar node with an uptake of 9.6.  The lesion in the
right lower lobe showed an SUV of 7.5, also suspicious for
malignancy.
There was no other site of FDG avidity on the study.  She also
underwent an [**Month/Day/Year 4338**] scan on [**2142-5-24**], that was negative for
metastatic disease.  In addition, a PFT was performed in [**Month (only) **]
[**2141**] disclosing FEV1 of 133% of predicted and a diffusion
capacity of 82% of predicted.

Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed a mediastinoscopy as well as bronchial
brushing on
[**2142-5-24**].  The mediastinoscopy was negative for carcinoma.
The bronchial brushing of the left lower lobe superior segment
was also negative.
The lesions in her right lower and left lower lobe are likely to
represent
synchronous primary lung cancers rather than stage IV disease
based upon a negative mediastinoscopy and no signs of metastatic
disease on her PET/CT scan.  As a result, on [**2142-6-11**], a Left
VATS converted to a left anterior thoracotomy, a resection of
superior segment of the left lower lobe, and a mediastinal lymph
node dissection were all performed. A right lower lobectomy is
actively being considered as a future treatment option.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 68 year old Female who on [**6-11**] had a Left VATS
converted to left anterior thoracotomy, a resection of superior
segment of the left lower lobe, and a mediastinal lymph node
dissection. She developed postoperative Atrial Fibrillation with
a rapid ventricular rate soon afterwards and her blood pressure
was initially 80/40, leading to a transfer to the intensive care
unit. By [**6-14**], the patient had rate stabilized at around 110-120
and her pressures was around 109/47. Amiodarone had begun being
loaded as per cardiology recommendations and so it was felt, Ms.
[**Known lastname 94074**] could be transferred to the floor. After coming to the
floor, Ms. [**Known lastname 94074**] gradually improved clinically though with
persistence of her atrial fibrillation. As per Cardiology
recommendations, on [**6-15**] an initial dose of Warfarin was given
along with Heparin anticoagulation. The patient remained within
the target aPTT and PTT ranges and so therapy continued. By
[**6-17**], the patient had converted to normal sinus rhythm, was rate
controlled and had improved clinically to the point where she
could follow up on an outpatient basis with her coumadin and
amiodarone medications. The patient was informed and agreed to
the mandatory scheduled INR checks in the coumadin clinics.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 94074**] is a 68yo female with CAD and PVD with multiple
coronary and peripheral artery stents and recent left lobectomy
for lung cancer complicated by atrial fibrillation on Coumadin
now presenting with LGIB.

# LGIB:  Upon admission, patient was given 2U PRBC and was
closely monitored on the wards, when she was noted to have a
large bloody bowel movement accompanied by onset of Afib with
RVR and hypotension. Patient was bolused with 500ml of NS and
transfered to the MICU for further management.  In the MICU,
patient continued to pass BRBPR and received an additional 10
units of PRBC. INR was measured at 2.2. ASA and coumadin were
discontinued, while plavix was continued. Colonoscopy was
performed on [**6-25**], showing old and new blood throughout the
colon, with more active bleeding present in the descending colon
when compared to ascending colon. Moderate to severe
diverticulosis was also noted. Per GI recs, tagged red blood
cell scan was performed on [**6-26**] and showed no evidence of GI
bleed. By [**6-26**], the patient had received a total of 10 units of
blood and was no longer passing BRBPR, though she continued to
pass clots. Hct stabilized in the upper 20s and INR was 1.1.
After transfer to the general medical service on [**6-26**], patient
continued to pass clots, but her hct remained stable in the
28-30 range. Towards the end of her stay ([**6-29**]), plavix was
discontinued and she was started on ASA 81mg.  Given history of
diverticular disease ([**2134**]) and severe diverticulosis observed
on colonoscopy, this episode of LGIB is most consistent with
diverticular bleeding.  She will follow up with her cardiologist
next week to discuss reinitiation of plavix and coumadin.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient had an episode of atrial
fibrillation on initial presentation associated with
hypotension, resulting in MICU transfer. She converted to sinus
and remained there while in the MICU. Patient was transferred to
the general medical service where she was monitored on telemetry
and had a recurrence of atrial fibrillation with RVR to the
140s, though mostly resting in the low 100s. She remained
hemodynamically stable with palpitations as her only symptom.
She spontaneously converted to sinus with a rate in the 60s the
following morning. She remained in sinus rhythm for the rest of
her hospital stay. Per recommendations of her outpatient
cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**], she was continued on her home dose of
amiodarone. Her coumadin was discontinued in the setting of her
GI bleed. Oral metoprolol was restarted at increased dose of
25mg tid.
.
# CAD: Patient remained chest pain free during her
hospitalization. Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] on admission to
discuss risks of being on ASA and Plavix. Given significant
cardiac history, they recommneded that she be continued on both.
Nitrate and beta-blocker were initially held in the setting of
GI bleed. In the latter part of her hospitalization given that
she was still having small amount of bleeding even on plavix
alone, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and he recommended
discontinuing the plavix given that her last bare metal stent
was placed in [**2140**] (renal artery stent), and her last
drug-eluting stent was placed in [**2136**]. She was instead put on
ASA 81mg daily.  As above, her metoprolol was restarted at a
higher dose given her a. fib with RVR.  She was, however,
normotensive at time of discharge so her imdur was held pending
follow up and repeat blood pressure check this upcoming week.
.
# PVD: Patient has several stents to renal and carotid arteries.
As above, her plavix was ultimately held and ASA was continued
at 81mg daily.  This will be addressed further upon outpatient
follow up with her PCP and cardiologist.
.
# CRI: Creatinine remained within her baseline throughout this
admission.
.
# Lung cancer: s/p lobectomy. Her respiratory status remained
stable during her hospital stay.  She has outpatient follow up
appointments scheduled with her oncologists next week.
.
# PMR: Patient on Prednisone 10mg as outpatient; she was
continued on this dose during her hospitalization.
.
# ACCESS: due to poor peripheral access, PICC line was placed
prior to transfer to the floor. This was removed prior to
discharge.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Lower GI bleed, probable diverticular bleed
Atrial fibrillation
Squamous cell lung cancer


Discharge Condition:
Stable, in normal sinus rhythm with stable hematocrit.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for lower gastrointestinal
bleeding, that is most likely due to diverticulosis. While you
were in the hospital, you went into atrial fibrillation and your
blood pressure decreased. You were sent to the intensive care
unit to manage your blood pressure and were transfused with 10
units of blood. Your home medications, aspirin and coumadin,
were stopped while you were in the hospital in order to help
control the bleeding. You underwent a colonoscopy which showed
blood and diverticula in your colon. A tagged red blood cell
scan to localize the source of bleeding was then done, and did
not show any active bleeding. After leaving the ICU, you were
transfered to the general medical floor where your heart rate,
rhythm, and blood pressure were monitored. You experienced
another episode of atrial fibrillation which resolved on its own
overnight. You were discharged when these became stable and you
were no longer bleeding.

While you were in the hospital we stopped your plavix and
coumadin, and changed your dose of aspirin from 325mg to 81mg.
When you go home please continue the aspirin 81mg but do NOT
restart the plavix or coumadin until following up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 120**]. We also increased your dose of metoprolol from 25 mg
twice a day to 25 mg three times a day. Please continue taking
the metoprolol 25 mg THREE TIMES per day when you go home. We
stopped your imdur while you were in the hospital and suggest
that you do not take anymore until you see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**] and he
re-evaluates you.

Please follow up with your primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
your cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**], and your oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
as detailed below.

Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you
develop shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizziness, chest
pain, blood in your stools or any other symptoms that concern
you.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Please see admission note for full details of history. Ms.
[**Name14 (STitle) 102143**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history of
right lower lobe squamous cell carcinoma, status-post resection
in [**2141**], treated with chemotherapy and thoracentesis in [**11/2142**],
who brain radiation in [**12/2141**], and recent admission for
pneumonia in [**12/2142**] treated with levofloxacin. Likely
leptomeningeal spread.
.
She presented to the ED [**2-16**] with dyspnea and increasing home O2
requirement. Her home nurse had also recently noted low BP,
causing her to miss her daily amiodarone and metoprolol. Her
dyspnea progressed from exertional to at rest over days. She
also had a chest discomfort, nonpleuritic. No fevers, chills, or
change in chronic productive cough. ROS otherwise negative.
.
Her initial vital signs were a temperature of 97.0, [**Month/Year (2) **]
pressure of 110/59, heart rate of 132, respiratory rate of 20,
and 91% on room air. She was given 2 mg of morphine, 4 mg of
zofran, 150 mg bolus of amiodarone IV, 200 mg of PO amiodarone,
5 mg of roxicet, 325 mg of tylenol, amiodarone drip, fentanyl 50
mcg, and 750 mg of levofloxacin. In the ED, she was initially
tachycardic with a heart rate as high as 140, but this converted
to sinus at a rate of 70 after administration of amiodarone.
There was concern for worsening metastatic disease or PE, so she
underwent a chest CT. It was negative for a pulmonary embolism,
however it did demonstrate a worsening multifocal pneumonia and
worsening metastatic disease as compared to PET/CT from
[**2143-1-21**]. During the time in the ED, her systolic [**Year (4 digits) **] pressure
ranged from 70-90's. She was given one liter of IVF. She was
transfered to the ICU for further management given her
hypotension and high oxygen requirement.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], there was concern for amiodarone pulmonary
toxicity, so this medication was stopped. Cardiology followed
her and recommended continuation of low-dose beta blocker.
Antibiotics were broadened to Bactrim (for possible PCP given
chronic steroid use) and levofloxacin. There was consideration
of broncoscopy for the purpose of BAL for culture, but the
patient declined. Currently she is on a non-rebreather with good
O2 Sats. She is also on stress-dose steroids given chronic
prednisone. She was given 2 units of pRBC.
.
Goals of care were addressed and revised to include DNR and no
invasive measures. Palliative care is following. She will be
transferred to the OMED team given no desire for ICU-level
aggressive measures.

Past Medical History:
Oncology History:
T2 N1 squamous cell lung cancer in the right lower lobe s/p
resection [**2142-6-11**]. Pathology notable for a positive margin,
lymphatic, and venous invasion. She is s/p chemo radiation and
resection of the right-sided lesion. She is s/p four cycles of
carboplatin and paclitaxel with the fourth cycle of chemotherapy
on [**2142-10-16**]. [**2142-11-27**] [**Year (4 digits) 4338**] of head with concern for
metastatic disease with a 5-mm enhancing lesion in the left
frontal lobe and a new 6 x 6 x 5 mm enhancing lesion in the
right parietal lobe with mild associated edema concerning for
cortical or leptomeningeal metastatic disease.
.
[**2142-12-7**] thoracentesis to drain left pleural effusion given
symptomatic cough. No evidence of malignancy with resolution of
cough but continued shortness of breath with exertion. CXR on
[**2142-12-11**] showed a persistent small left pleural effusion.
.
[**2142-12-18**] whole brain radiation therapy and radiation therapy to
her sacral metastasis with intermittent pain requiring dilaudid,
nausea and dry heaves requring compazine. She continued to have
chronic lower extremity weakness which has not changed in
severity.
.
[**2142-12-31**] Patient completed course of radiation to C2 Whole Brain
and Sacrum. She received a total dose of 3000 cGy to each site.
Of note she has had increased sacral pain and worsening nausea
and dry heaves. She was attempting Zofran, and dilaudid 2 mg Q6
as needed for pain. She also reported slight worsening of her
shortness of breath. No pleuritic chest pain. At that time o2
sat 94%RA.

Social History:
Married. Smoked in the past but quit 25 years ago, denies
alcohol or illicit drug use.


Family History:
The patient's father died of CAD as did her mother.  Two
brothers have CAD.  A sister has had multiple TIAs.


Physical Exam:
Vital Signs BP 110/53, HR 76, O2 Sat 96% on NRB
GENERAL: pleasant woman, appears comfortable
HEENT: slopecia, pupils small but reactive, no scleral icterus
NECK: supple, JVP not appreciated
LUNGS: decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion over
left base, diffuse bronchial breath sounds over b/l lung fields
CARDIAC: regular, no murmurs
ABDOMEN: soft, nontender, nondistended
EXTR: warm, no edema, ecchymoses over right tibia.
NEURO: alert and oriented
PSYCH: pleasant, appropriate
.

Pertinent Results:
[**2143-2-16**] CTPA

1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

2. Persistent diffuse ground-glass opacity in the right upper
lobe and
worsened ground-glass within the lingula are concerning for
worsening
multifocal infection.

3. Increased size of pulmonary nodules concerning for worsening
metastatic
disease.

[**2143-2-18**] Echo
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypo/akinesis
of the basal half of the inferiorseptum, inferior, and
inferolateral walls. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 50 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. At least moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. At least
moderate mitral regurgitation suggestive of papillary muscle
dysfunction.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-6-13**], the
severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 94074**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history
of squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation who presented
with dyspnea and was found to have multifocal pneumonia.
.
#) Multifocal pneumonia: Likely related to underlying cancer,
possibly post-obstructive. O2 Sats were mostly in the upper 90s
on nonrebreather. Patient initially wanted like to continue
antibiotics, but has declined elective intubation for BAL
cultures after sputum cx contaminated. Thus she was transferred
to OMED given no desire for aggressive measures. There goals of
care were further revised ot include comfort measures only.
Antibiotics were stopped.  Stress dose steroids were quickly
tapered.  She was given nebulizer treatments as needed for
comfort.  Because there was a question of mild volume overload,
she was also given lasix 20 mg IV as needed, which seemed to
help.  A foley was placed to improve comfort of urination given
that she was becoming short of breath with any transfer.
.
#) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR
in the setting of missing amiodarone. Converted to NSR with
amiodarone and beta blocker. She was not anticoagulated
secondary to history of GI bleed. Cardiology followed her.  When
goals of care were revised to comfort, metoprolol PO was
continued to prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Prior to discharge she again developed atrial fibrillation but
was not uncomfortable.  Metoprolol was continued.
.
#) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] as an
outpatient. Brain metastases have responded to XRT, but
worsening pulmonary disease burden. Patient is followed by Drs.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] here at [**Hospital1 18**]. There were no plans for
further chemotherapy, as the cancer was considered end-stage.
.
#) Anemia: She received 2 units pRBC in the ICU.  When goals of
care were revised no futher labs were drawn.
.
#) Chronic renal insufficiency: Creatinine was initially below
baseline 1.1-1.2.  Lab tests were stopped
.
#) Polymyalgia rheumatica: On 10 mg prednisone daily at home.
Received stress-dose steroids here in the setting of infection.
This was quickly tapered back to her home dose, which may be
continued to prevent recurrence of PMR.
.
#) Coronary artery disease: Aspirin, [**Last Name (un) **] were stopped after
goals of care were revised.
.
#) Gout: No active symptoms.  Allopurinol was stopped.
.
#) Contact: [**Name (NI) **], daughter # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 102144**]
.
#) Code: Code status at discharge was DNR, DNI, no ICU transfers
or aggressive measures, with primary goal of care being comfort.

Chief Complaint:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman who had undergone an x-ray
for shoulder pain that had disclosed bilateral lung
abnormalities.  A CT scan was performed and confirmed a solid
nodule in the superior segment of her left lower lobe highly
suspicious for malignancy as well as a bulla in the right lower
lobe with a thickened cyst wall also concerning for malignancy.

A PET scan was performed subsequent to the CT scan.  This showed

that the left lower lobe nodule showed an SUV of 16.4 as well as

a left hilar node with an uptake of 9.6.  The lesion in the
right lower lobe showed an SUV of 7.5, also suspicious for
malignancy.
There was no other site of FDG avidity on the study.  She also
underwent an MRI scan on [**2142-5-24**], that was negative for
metastatic disease.  In addition, a PFT was performed in [**Month (only) **]
[**2141**] disclosing FEV1 of 133% of predicted and a diffusion
capacity of 82% of predicted.

Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed a mediastinoscopy as well as bronchial
brushing on
[**2142-5-24**].  The mediastinoscopy was negative for carcinoma.
The bronchial brushing of the left lower lobe superior segment
was also negative.
The lesions in her right lower and left lower lobe are likely to

represent
synchronous primary lung cancers rather than stage IV disease
based upon a negative mediastinoscopy and no signs of metastatic

disease on her PET/CT scan.  As a result, on [**2142-6-11**], a Left
VATS converted to a left anterior thoracotomy, a resection of
superior segment of the left lower lobe, and a mediastinal lymph

node dissection were all performed. A right lower lobectomy is
actively being considered as a future treatment option.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 68 year old Female who on [**6-11**] had a Left VATS
converted to left anterior thoracotomy, a resection of superior
segment of the left lower lobe, and a mediastinal lymph node
dissection. She developed postoperative Atrial Fibrillation with
a rapid ventricular rate soon afterwards and her blood pressure
was initially 80/40, leading to a transfer to the intensive care
unit. By [**6-14**], the patient had rate stabilized at around 110-120
and her pressures was around 109/47. Amiodarone had begun being
loaded as per cardiology recommendations and so it was felt, Ms.

[**Known lastname **] could be transferred to the floor. After coming to the
floor, Ms. [**Known lastname **] gradually improved clinically though with
persistence of her atrial fibrillation. As per Cardiology
recommendations, on [**6-15**] an initial dose of Warfarin was given
along with Heparin anticoagulation. On [**2142-6-17**], she developed
rapid A Fib into the 130s. Her lopressor was increased to 37.5
[**Hospital1 **] which she converted to sinus rhythm. Cardiology was
reconsulted and felt she had tachy-brady syndrome, and
recommended she be discharged home with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor
which was arranged.  On [**6-18**] her INR was 3.8 the coumadin was
held and a repeat INR on [**6-19**] was 2.8.  She was discharged to
home with coumadin 1 mg and to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] her PCP
for further coumadin dosing, follow-up with cardiology Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].
[**Name (NI) 2124**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79 year old
female with a history of severe aortic stenosis,
hypertension, coronary artery disease, who presented to
outside hospital emergency [**Hospital1 **] after a mechanical fall.
According to the patient she was walking to the television to
turn it on when she slipped and fell on her left side.  The
patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath, and
dizziness.  There was no loss of consciousness.  They
presented to the outside hospital emergency [**Hospital1 **] where
radiographs revealed a comminuted fracture of the distal left
femur extending into the joint surface.  The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital6 256**].  The
patient was admitted for surgical fixation of her fracture.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient reports having had
myocardial infarction and had a normal exercise stress test
at [**Hospital1 **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] a year and a half ago.  She never had
cardiac catheterization.  She has been followed by primary
care physician for cardiac problems.  [**Name (NI) **] obtained from
the outside hospital, [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **], echocardiogram was
done on [**2132-1-17**] with an ejection fraction of 30%,
severe aortic stenosis with the aortic valve area of 0.7 cm
squared.  The patient denied a history of hypertension,
diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, tobacco use, congestive heart
failure, chest pain or syncopal episodes.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lasix, Metoprolol, [**Doctor First Name 233**]-Ciel and
Acetaminophen.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone at home and is
independent with all activities of daily living.  She
ambulates one flight of stairs in-house.

Echocardiogram, normal sinus rhythm, left ventricular
hypertrophy, 1 to [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in V1 to V3, no change
compared to echocardiogram from [**2131-1-16**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on presentation
reveals the patient is a white female in no distress.  Head
atraumatic, normocephalic.  Eyes, extraocular movements
intact.  Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart
regular rate and rhythm.  Left lower extremity with flexion
deformity.  No ulcerations, no abrasions.  Extensor hallucis
longus, flexor hallucis longus, anterior tibialis [**5-19**], normal
sensation to light touch in L1-S1.  Dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial pulses 2+.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Due to severity of aortic stenosis, the
patient was transferred to the Medical Service.  The case was
discussed with Anesthesia.  They feel that it was not safe
for the patient to proceed without further workup.  The
patient went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on
[**2132-10-31**] where the patient underwent valvuloplasty of
the aortic valve.  As a result, gradient across the aortic
valve was decreased from 87 to 33 mm of mercury, E to A
increased from baseline of 0.36 cm square to 0.65 square.
After angioplasty the patient had episode of bleeding on
[**2132-11-1**] and had developed a large groin hematoma.
Hematocrit fell down to 21 with blood pressure as low as 56
to 20.  The patient was resuscitated with fluids and started
on Dopamine.  The patient was intubated and transferred to
the Cardiac Care Unit.  Pressures throughout the stay in the
Cardiac Unit the patient has been noted to be arousable and
followed commands on request.  Left EJ line, the patient
received blood transfusions with 5 units of red blood cells
and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma.  Hematocrit, blood
pressure and heartrate stabilized in acceptable range.  The
patient had several episodes of tachycardia and atrial
flutter which normalized with Amiodarone.

On [**2132-11-5**], the patient was taken to the Operating
Room where she underwent open reduction and internal fixation
with [**Last Name (un) 101**] plate placement.  She was operated on by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 284**].  She tolerated the procedure well and went back
to the Cardiac Care Unit.  It was noted that the patient had
a lack of cough lead and could not be extubated immediately.
She was started on Dexamethasone to decrease the swelling
prior to orthopedic surgery.  She was extubated on [**2132-11-7**].  It was noted that the patient had a somewhat
slowness of speech.  Neurology consult was requested.  Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] saw the patient and did not believe the patient
had aphasia and the reason for slowed speech was secondary to
coming off of intubation along with Fentanyl therapy.
Neurological examination was entirely nonlocalized.

At the time of this dictation, [**2132-11-7**], the patient
is alert and has no problems talking to her providers and
family.  The patient was mobilized by physical therapy who
notes she is nonweightbearing on the left lower extremity.
The patient has [**Doctor Last Name **] immobilizer block in extension.  The
patient needs prolonged course of rehabilitation.  The
patient was screened by rehabilitation facility and will be
tentatively discharged there on [**2132-11-10**], and
addendum will be dictated.

History of Present Illness:
   This is a 52 yo male with multiple medical problems including
ESRD s/p failed renal transplant on HD, DM, HTN, recurrent UTIs
with VRE and resistant proteus who presented to OSH with fevers,
myalgias, and fatigue.  He was found to be hypotensive with
presumed urosepsis and was started on Vanc/Gent/Linezolid/Ceftaz
and on Neo.  During the hospitalization, he developed CP
radiating to the jaw with ECG changes and elevated CK (600) and
Trop I (28).  Pt was started on heparin but cardiac
catheterization was deferred pending stabilization from
urosepsis.  Pt experienced a second episode of CP which was
relieved with NTG, but with new lateral ST depressions. At this
time, a combination of cardiogenic and septic shock was
suspected and a TTE was done, showing new global HK w/ EF 30%,
ant/[**Month (only) **]/apical HK, worsening AS, severe PA HTN, dilated RV, and
severe TR. Pt was started on Dopamine instead of Neo, placed on

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 52yo male with multiple medical problems including left
main and 3VD s/p PTCA, ESRD s/p failed cadaveric renal
transplant on HD, recurrent UTI with VRE and proteus s/p
kidney/bladder remal with neobladder formation and urostomy.
.
1. CV: Pt was admitted to the CCU directly from the OSH and
continued on Linezolid, and  started on Gentamycin for UTI.  He
was hemodynamically stable, requiring no pressors, and had no
chest pain on arrival.  On the morning after admission he
developed chest pain and was started on heparin and taken to the
catheterization lab where he was found to have  LMA, LCx, and
LAD disease with RCA occlusion.  A IABP was placed to increase
perfusion.  After extensive discussion with the CT surgery team,
who felt that the surical mortality risk was 20%, it was decided
that the pt would be taken for PCI.  At the second cardiac
catheterization, pt received kissing stents to LAD and LCx.  It
was recommended that he have a relook catheterization in 3 then
7 months.  He tolerated the procedure well and was taken off
thye balloon pump shortly after catheterization.
   The patient's cardiovascular medications were titrated to
give him the maximum medical benefit.  He was placed on ASA,
clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril.  He
tolerated these medications well.  He had only one more episode
of chest pain, rated [**2-16**], which occurred during dialysis, and
resolved within minutes on its own.  He had no EKG changes at
that time.  Because he has drug-eluting stents, he should
remained on Plavix for at least 9 months.  His EF at the OSH was
reportedly 30%.  In approximately three weeks, the patient will
need a repeat TTE to evaluate for interval change in his EF.
His volume status was maintained at hemodialysis.  He remained
in sinus rhythm throughout his stay, but was often tachycardic.
We were unable to decrease his beta-blocker any more, because
his blood pressure was often around 100/60.  His tachycardia may
also have been due to pain [**3-11**] his sacral ulcers.
.
2. ID:  In regards to the UTI, the pt has had a history of
recurrent UTIs which in the past required the removal of his
bladder, and placement of a neobladder and urostomy.  From the
OSH, he had cultures of his urine which grew VRE and proteus.
The proteus was sensitive only to gentamicin and cefuroxime.  He
was treated with gentamicin for the proteus, and Linezolid for
the VRE (14/14 day course completed).  He remained afebrile
throughout his hospital course at OSH.  Pt complained of pain at
the site of ulcers at his buttocks.  Plastic surgery was
consulted, and his ulcers were debrided and treated with enzyme
based dressings.  Plastic surgery felt that these ulcers were
unlikely to be the source of his sepsis at OSH.  They recommend
continuation of TID dressing changes and to consider a rectal
tube to protect the dressing/tube.  He will need re-evaluation
by plastic surgery for a possible flap in the future.
.
3.  Sacral decubitis ulcers:  The patient has 2 stage 3 ulcers
on his R and L buttocks.  These were debrided at the bedside
several times by plastic surgery.  They felt that a flap may be
necessary in the future, but was not indicated during this
hospitalization.  He also developed an intramuscular abscess
next to his ulcer, which was incised and drained by plastics.
This fluid grew proteus (not enough for sensitivities) and
pseudomonas.  Because the patient remained afebrile, it was
decided to not treat him for these, as he is likely to be
colonized.
.
4.  Renal:  The patient was kept on his Mon, Wed, Fri
hemodialysis schedule.  He was also kept on nephrocaps, and his
phos-lo was changed to Renagel as he has a history of
calciphylaxis with phos-lo.  He takes prednisone at home for his
failed renal graft, with the thought being that it should
prevent him from developing an immune response to alloantigens
that would subsequently prevent him from tolerating another
transplant.  He was tapered to a home dose of 5 mg prednisone.
.
5.  Anemia: As the patient was admitted with ACS and significant
CAD, the transfusion criteria remained >30.  As the patient
remained on ASA and plavix for his cardiac stents he remained at
high risk for bleeding and was monitored closely with
transfusions PRN to maintain Hct >30.
A).  The patient had 3 episodes of hemoptysis on [**2105-3-13**].  These
consisted of coughing up small (1 cm) blood clots.  He did not
cough up any bright red blood.  On further questioning, the
patient reported having a nosebleed earlier that day.  In terms
of his respiratory status, he was kept on his outpatient
inhalers.  His oxygen saturation remained greater than 92%.  On
further questioning the patient admitted to having had previous
nose bleeds, usually in the setting of dry/cold weather.  The
patient was taken off the NC as his oxygen saturation remained
>92% on RA and was given a nasal spray with good effect.  He
remained without further episodes of hemoptysis or nose bleeds
for >4 days.
B).  The patient was also noted to have guaiac positive
stool/BRBPR (little flecks of blood) on [**2105-3-14**].  On rectal exam
he was noted to have some external hemorrhoids, although none
were found to be bleeding at the time.  However, as the patient
had just had a cardiac catheterization in the setting of acute
coronary syndrome, a colonoscopy was deferred.  As he remained
hemodynamically stable and Hct was mostly steady, it was decided
that the risk of colonoscopy outweighed the benefits in the
immediate setting.  Recommend outpatient colonoscopy to better
evaluate his source of BRBPR.
.
6.  Endocrine:  The patient was kept on an insulin sliding scale
for his diabetes.  He was transferred from an OSH on stress-dose
steroids, which were weaned down to his home dose of prednisone
of 5mg once daily.  The finger sticks remained within normal
limits.
.
7.  LUE edema: The patient was found to have some moderate LUE
edema. U/S shows patent AV fistula and no LUE DVT.  Pt was
treated with ice and elevation with good resolution.
.
8.  FEN: The patient was maintained on a renal/cardiac diet
.
9.  PPx: The patient was maintained on H2 blolcker, bowel
regimen consisting of colace and senna, and SQ heparin for DVT
prophylaxis.
.
10. CODE: DNR/DNI confirmed on multiple occasions with patient.

History of Present Illness:
52yo male w/ MMP who presented to OSH after the onset of CP at
rest. Described CP as pressure in the center of his chest that
radiated across the base of his chest bilaterally and up to his
throat. It was not associated w/ SOB, n/v or diaphoresis. It
lasted for about 15 mins, but he had no nitro in the house, so
he called EMS. Was given 4 baby ASA by EMS and nitro x1 in the
ER before his CP resolved. First set CE at OSH were negative.
Had repeat episode of CP at 5am, resolved on its own. Again, had
another episode of CP while boarding the helicopter for
transport here. Was given fentanyl w/ resolution of his pain.
.
Last episode of CP was [**2106-3-22**] at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital. Was
there for L subclavian vein stenting and in PACU, developed CP
similar in character to what he felt last night. Was kept in the
hospital for 1 week and underwent a chemical stress test which
he says revealed ""abnormalities"" but nothing that had to be
dealt with immediately. On discharge, he was told to resume
taking ASA daily. He had not been taking ASA or plavix since
[**7-12**] when he underwent surgery for his decubitus ulcers.
.
Last evening, at OSH, he was given ASA 325 + SL ntg w/ relief of
his CP. EKG on admission showed ST depression in V5-6, with ?
TWI I, II. Q waves in III, avF. Overnight, he did well until 5am
when he developed chest heaviness. It resolved on its own, but
his EKG showed worsening ST depressions in V5 and V6 and his
tropI increased from <0.1 to 1.6 (CK 45 -> 54). The decision was
made to transfer him to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath. He was set for
ground transport when he began to develop CP again. He was
instead MedFlighted here as his BP was also tenous (SBPs in
80s-90s). He was started on reopro, heparin, and plavix (600mg
x1) and was transferred straight to the cath lab. In the cath
lab, it was found that he has in-stent restenosis and needs
surgical intervention. Plan is to take him to CABG once vascular
imaging performed to identify suitable grafts. IABP placed in
cath lab and referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] for urgent CABG.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2106-4-4**] for further
management of his myocardial infarction. A cardiac
catheterization was performed which revealed severe three vessel
disease and a intra-aortic balloon pump was placed. Heparin was
continued for anticoagulation and he remained pain free. Given
his history of end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, the
renal service was consulted for assistance with his management.
Given the severity of his disease, the cardiac surgical service
was consulted for surgical management and Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. He underwent
hemodialysis on [**2106-4-5**] in preparation for surgery without
complication. An echocardiogram was performed which showed an
ejection fraction of 55%, [**2-8**]+ mitral regurgitation and moderate
aortic valve stenosis with a valve area of 0.9cm2. The plastic
surgery service was consulted for evaluation of his sacral
decubitus ulcer and no surgical intervention was recommended at
this time. The wound care nurse was asked to assist in his care
throughoout his hospital stay. The infectious disease service
was consulted given his history of mutiple infectious disease
issues and vancomycin and zosyn were recommened perioperatively
for prophylaxis. On [**2106-4-6**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the
operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to three vessels as well as an aortic valve replacement
utilizing a 23mm [**Doctor Last Name **] magna valve.  Afterward he was
transferred to the Cardiac surgery recovery unit in stable
condition and awakened neurologically intake.

 He required post op IABP and pressor support due to low cardiac
output which was successfully weaned.  On POD 2 He was
transfused 2U PRBC for a low HCT during HD.    He was
aggressively diuresed toward his preoperative weight with HD,
aspirin therapy was resumed, and physical therapy service was
consulted to assist with his postoperative strength and
mobility. Electrolytes were repleted as needed.  On POD 3 He had
a PICC line placed for continued perioperative IV vancomycin and
Zosyn given his history of UTI, sacral decubitis infection, and
intramuscular abscess.  His epicardial pacing wires were
removed.  He subsequently became hypotensive, arrested and CPR
was started.  TEE showed hemopericardium for which he had his
sternotomy opened.  An avulsed side branch of the SVG->RCA graft
was isolated and ligated with 7-0 prolene at the bedside.  Mr.
[**Known lastname **] regained pulses and his hemodynamics stabilized. He
continued to require pressor support and diuresis was
accomplished using CVVHD at the bedside. On POD [**6-8**] His chest
tubes were removed without complication. On POD [**8-10**] his pressor
support was weaned and CVVHD was discontinued.  He was
transferred to the cardiac step down unit for further recovery.
He was initially requiring daily HD until POD [**11-13**]. At which
time he resumed his qod schedule.  Given his need for sternal
precautions his activity level was OOB to chair via [**Doctor Last Name 2598**] lift.
Plastic surgery was consulted for decubitus evaluation, and
wound care team continued to follow him.

He had some nausea on POD 14/11, amylase was 258, KUB was
unremarkable. Repeat amylase was 124. HD continued per renal
service. Pain meds were changed and nausea was relieved. OT
evaluation also done. HD done on [**4-23**] and pt. cleared for
discharge to rehab on POD 17/14. Please see discharge plan for
required follow- up instructions.

INDICATIONS: 80 year old man with carotid artery stenosis.
Evaluation of the
vasculature requested.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1, T2, and susceptibility images of the
brain were
obtained. No contrast was administered. MR angiography of the
circle of [**Location (un) 431**] was performed with acquisition of two- and
three- dimensional time-of-flight images. MR angiography of the
neck was also performed with two- and three-dimensional
time- of- flight images of the major arteries.

FINDINGS: On the brain images, there is no evidence of
hydrocephalus, mass
effect, or shift of the normally midline structures. The
ventricles,
cisterns, and sulci are unremarkable. There are patchy areas of
increased T2
signal in the pons. There are also widespread patchy areas of
increased T2
signal in the subcortical white matter of both cerebral
hemispheres. These
signal abnormalities are consistent with chronic small vessel
ischemic
infarcts. Also, in the posterosuperior right frontal cortex,
there is a small
area of increased T2 signal in the cortex consistent with a
chronic
infarction. A similar small infarct in the head of the left
caudate nucleus
is also observed. No susceptibility artifact is seen. The
visualized
vascular flow voids are present. The osseous structures, soft
tissues, and
sinuses are unremarkable. MR angiography of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**]
shows no evidence of stenosis in the major vessels. Along the
proximal right posterior cerebral artery, there is a tiny focus
of increased signal intensity on the two-dimensional
time-of-flight images. In the source images, there is no
suggestion of an aneurysm at that site. This small focus appears
to be an artifact. There is no definite
evidence of an aneurysm. MR angiography of the carotid and
vertebral arteries in the neck is significant for a severe
stenosis beyond the bifurcation in the left proximal internal
carotid artery. Only mild carotid narrowing is seen at the left
carotid bifurcation. The left carotid bifurcation is more
superiorly located
than the right, and accordingly, three-dimensional time-
of-flight images
understandably did not entirely cover this area. The severe left
proximal
internal carotid stenosis is best visualized on the
two-dimensional time- of-
flight images. On the right side, on both the two- and
three-dimensional
time-of- flight images, a probable moderate to severe right
carotid stenosis
at the bifurcation, and moderate to severe right proximal
internal carotid
stenosis is also seen.

IMPRESSION: The head MRI shows evidence of widespread patchy
increased T2
signal. These are are consistent with chronic small vessel
ischemic infarcts. The MR angiogram of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**]
shows no definite evidence of stenosis or aneurysm. The MR
angiogram of the neck is significant for a severe left internal
carotid artery stenosis beyond the bifurcation, with mild
stenosis at the bifurcation. On the right, there is evidence of
moderate to severe stenosis at the
bifurcation and in the proximal internal carotid artery.

zone are likely related to previous granulomatous disease. There
is no
mediastinal adenopathy. There is no effusion or bone
destruction.
Procedure Date:[**2128-6-26**]


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted for stent placement in the left ICA. Pt. returned from
cath with 1.5 mcg/kg/min of phenylephrine, successfully weaned.
Pt. experienced brief bouts of non-specific bilateral radiating
numbness but with consistently normal CNII-XII exam; likely
transient vagal depression nature. The patient also has a
biventricular ICD implanted, which was interrogated prior to the
stent procedure. It was determined that the RV lead/ICD had
become dislodged. The defibrillator function was disabled,
leaving the device operating as an RA/LV DDD pacer. CXR
indicated that the RV lead had ascended into the RA. The pacer
function began to be impaired by erroneous sensing, with pacing
occuring on the ST segment leading to brief aberrant NSVT runs.
EP put the ICD into [**Last Name (un) **] (sense-only) mode, and the patients
leads were then percutaneously resited satisfactorily as
confirmed by repeat CXR. ICD function was tested and found to be
satisfactory. The patient did well after carotid stenting and
ICD lead revision and was subsequently discharged home with
assistance in stable and improved condition.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was initially stable on the floor, without fever or
hypotension.  Then, in AM of [**2170-10-7**], he decompensated with
temp to 101.6, rigors, and hypotension with SBP of 80's.
Additionally, his oxygen dropped to 78% on RA -> 97% on 100% NRB
-> 97% on 3L NC. He was initially stabilized with 4L of NS
boluses, but hypotension persisted to 70's systolic. Dopamine
was started.  Hypoxia persisted with sats in 80's on 100% NRB. A
respiratory code was called, and he was intubated by Anesthesia.
ABG done at codewhile on 100% NRB was 7.43/31/132, lactate of
2.0.  He was transferred to the CCU for further treatment.
.
In the CCU he required one pressor for less than 24 hours. His
hypotension was felt to be due to vasodilation from sepsis in
combination with hypovolemia. His culture data only revealed
gram negative rods in his urine, and Vanc, Levo and Flagyl were
continued. He was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. The
etiology of his hypoxemia was unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 227**] his rapidly
deteriorating neurolgic function from Parkinsons' he may have
aspirated, although, he did not have radiologic evidence of a
pneumonia.  His hypoxemia may have been due to acidosis and v/q
mismatching.  LENIs did not reveal evidence of DVT. He was
extubated successfully on [**10-11**]. He had moderate secretions and
received aggressive chest PT, but maintained adequate O2 sats on
shovel mask.  Additionally, he was started on low dose
beta-blocker for hypertension and treated with free water
boluses for hypernatremia.  During his ICU stay he was less
responsive to stimuli and a repeat CT scan revealed unchanged
size and mass effect from subdural hematoma.  His mental status
improved to baseline according to family after weaning sedation.
 He developed LUE edema and on [**10-13**] a LUE doppler was performed
which showed occlusive thrombosis of both brachial veins and the
axillary vein, and nearly completely occlusive thrombosis of the
subclavian vein.  Pt. had not been receiving SC Heparin because
of his known subdural hematoma and risk for increased bleeding
and mass effect, and a decision was made not to anti-coagulate
him, even given the doppler results.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] stim test was
performed, with decreased Cortisol response, and pt. was pulsed
with 7 days of fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone. During his
CCU stay, he was started on tube feeds. A discussion was begun
with the family regarding long-term nutrition and possible peg
placement. He was about 8 L positive on day of transfer, and had
been receiving Lasix QD. Pt was transfered from CCU to the floor
on [**2170-10-15**] with resolved urosepsis.  Pt remained afebrile but
un-responsive.  He finished Vanc/Levo/Flagyl x 10 days.  His WBC
continued to be elevated.  Family discussion was held and
patient was made CMO.  Pt was started on Morphine drip titrated
to comfort.  Pt's breathing became more agonal over next few
days and he peacefully expired on [**2170-10-19**] @ 10:18 am.  Family
was notified and were able to say their final goodbyes while
patient was still in the hospital.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname 20741**] is a 29 year-old
woman with MELAS (mitochondrial encephalo-myopathy with
lactic acidosis and stroke like symptoms) who was brought into
the Emergency Room by her mother for a gradual decline in
mental status over the past week that led to a fall the
had been increasingly agitated and emotional for the past few
days. Family members report that she took her anti-seizure
medication of the next 3-4 days all at once and became
""confused"". The patient remembers falling, but cannot relay the
immediate events prior to and after the fall.

Until recently [**Known firstname **] was driving, working as a greeter at an
mother reports that she has been less able to care for
herself and has had to move back into her mother's house in
the past few weeks.

[**Known firstname **] states that she feels like she is ""going to die"" and
that her ""mother is going to leave,"" but expresses no
intention to harm herself.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  MELAS diagnosed at age 18 after
presenting with poor weight gain, headaches, repeated
seizures.  Prior to these events [**Known firstname **] was enrolled in
college.  [**Known firstname 20742**] mother reports three strokes at age 20, 24
and 29 namely one month ago.  Her mother reports no residual
effects of any of the strokes.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1.  Dilantin 100 t.i.d.  2.
Verapamil 240 q.d.  3.  Vitamin C 500 b.i.d.  4.  Vitamin E
400 IU q.d.  5.  Co-enzyme q 150 q.d.  6.  Riboflavin/calcium
100/40 q.d.  7.  Mebaral 50 q.d.  8.  Klonopin 0.5 t.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol, drugs or tobacco use.  Her
parents are divorced.  She is currently cared for by her
mother and a [**Name (NI) 269**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She was afebrile.  She had a blood
pressure of 127/73.  Heart rate of 70 and was sating 100% on
room air.  She was lying in the stretcher and was easily
distracted.  She had an ecchymosis over her left eye and some
perioral dermatitis.  Her abdomen was soft, nontender and
nondistended.  Her fundi were clear.  She was alert and did
not follow commands well.  She knew her name, date and place.
She was able to spell her name forward and backward.  Her
immediate recall was 4 out of 4 with her memory being 0 out
of 4 after 30 seconds.  She was able to repeat sentences,
read name tags and follow two step commands.  She was able to
clap her hands.  She had normal facial sensation.  Her face
was symmetric.  Her hearing was intact and her tongue was
midline.  Her muscle bulk was decreased without hypotonia.
She is moving her extremities spontaneously and on command
and lifted her legs well.  She had no tremor.  Her sensation
was intact to light touch throughout her upper and lower
extremities.  Her toes were down going.  Her lungs were clear
and her heart rate was regular in rhythm and rate with no
murmurs.

LABORATORY:  Her HCG was negative.  Her electrolytes were
normal.  Her Dilantin level was 35.

Head CT showed no acute process.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 20741**] was admitted for observation
given her high Dilantin levels and her mental status changes.
Over the next few days, Ms. [**Known lastname 20741**] developed severe metabolic
acidosis with high lactate levels and an aspiration pneumonia
that required intubation and ICU admission. She was given
Levaquin with clearing of her pneumonia. Her lactic acidosis was
succesfully corrected with hyperventilation and fluids in the
next day. However, she failed extubation twice and on the [**8-17**] required placement of a tracheostomy tube. She also had a
PEG tube placed at that point. She then developed seizures that
were eventually controlled with Dilantin, Keppra, and Ativan.  At
this point she developed a second right lower lobe pneumonia. She
was initially treated with Clindamycin and Cipro. Due to her
decreased responsiveness with quadriplegia, a head MRI was
obtained on the [**8-24**] that showed wide spread bilateral
cortical hyperintensitis on FLAIR, DWI and T2WI consistent with
stroke- like lesions and remarkable subcortical atrophy with a
normal MRA. EMG was also obtained that showed diffused severe
myopathy possibly consistent with critical care myopathy. An
abdominal CT obtained around that time showed a right colon
impaction believed to be secondary to dysmotility from MELAS
syndrome. A general surgical consult believed that she was not a
good surgical candidate and had recommended that she become NPO
with NGD compression and TPN for nutrition.  Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] from the
neuro-muscular service was also consulted who reccomended a 5
day-course of high dose IV Prednisone. At the end of the 5 days
due to her lack of significant improvement, a family consult was
obtained that agreed on making the patient DNR/DNI, comfort
measures only and the antibiotics were stopped on the [**8-29**].
At this point she began to show clinical improvement and so was
reinstated to full code status on the [**8-2**]. TPN was
restarted and aggressive bowel regimen was begun to try to clear
her partial large bowel obstruction. On the [**8-3**] she
became febrile and was found to have coag negative staph
bacteremia. The right subclavian line she had in was stopped at
that point and she was started on Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone.
A chest x-ray on the [**8-8**] showed increasing
infiltrates in the right middle lobe and the left lung, so her
Ceftriaxone was changed to Zosyn.  As she was seizure free from
the [**7-31**] she was transferred to the Medicine Service
to manage her pneumonia and her partial large bowel obstruction.
After her transfer she remained afebrile and repeat blood
cultures were negative.  An infectious disease consult was
obtained that recommended five days of Vanco for her line sepsis
and fourteen days of Zosyn for her pneumonia. She did well on
both of these treatments. A GI consult was obtained with regard
to her partial large bowel obstruction and an aggressive bowel
regimen including Reglan, suppositories, enemas, Colace and
Golytely was recommended, which helped to clean out most of her
bowel.  By the time of this dictation her abdomen is soft and
only a single mass of stool is palpable in the suprapubic region.
She was on TPN for nutrition for most of [**Month (only) **] until the
[**8-17**] when her family decided they wished to
withdraw treatment and at that point her TPN was stopped.
From a neurological standpoint her Dilantin level was 26 on the
[**8-16**] and so it was held and will be restarted after
her level drops to the low 15.  She will continue on IV
Ativan for seizure prophylaxis.
On the [**8-18**] her neurological status has progressed
to the point where she is not responsive to voice except for
occasionally.  She has been afebrile for over a week and has
improved clinically in terms of her pneumonia with decreased
secretions on the Zosyn.  She will have three more days of Zosyn
and then be done with antibiotics.  Her NG tube and PEG tube are
clamped and she is receiving no more drugs for her bowel regimen.
She continues to receive trach care and suctioning with stable
amount of secretions.  Her antiepileptic drugs include Ativan and
Dilantin.  The Dilantin is being held and his being restarted
after the levels are less then 15.  She is in the midst of a
Solu-Medrol taper.  The only other medications that she is
receiving are heparin and Protonix for prophylactic purposes.

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 62-year-old gentleman
presented with two week history of epigastric discomfort
ruled in for myocardial infarction and had an episode of
V-fib that responded to cardioversion.  He was transferred
into [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac
catheterization, which showed 80% left anterior descending
artery lesion, 40% diagonal lesion, 60% circumflex lesion,
OM-2 30% lesion, OM-3 30% lesion, a 50% right coronary artery
lesion with a 30% PDA lesion, and an ejection fraction of
27%.

On Cath Lab an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed for his
ventricular dysfunction and severe three-vessel disease.  He
is referred to Cardiothoracic Surgery Service for evaluation
of CABG.

Preoperative laboratory work was white count of 9.3,
hematocrit 42.5.  Sodium 137, K 4.4, chloride 102, CO2 27,
BUN 18, creatinine 1.1 with a blood sugar of 219.

Past medical history includes hypertension and
hypercholesterolemia as well as bilateral kidney stone
removal and appendectomy.  Patient also reported a two small
purulent nodal areas in his abdomen and his left thigh,
non-insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus.

He had no known allergies.

Medications on admission were Zocor, Cozaar, Glyburide,
Glucophage, and was now on IV Integrilin when seen by Cardiac
Surgery.

On examination, his blood pressure was 107/64 with a heart
rate of 71.  He had no carotid bruits.  Heart was regular,
rate, and rhythm.  His lungs were clear bilaterally.  His
abdominal examination was benign.  He had no varicose veins
and had distal pulses present in his feet.

His electrocardiogram showed Q waves in V1 through V3 as well
as ST depressions in V4, V5, and 6, and aVL.

He will referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**].  On [**6-9**], he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x4 with a LIMA to
the left anterior descending artery, a vein graft to the PDA,
a vein graft to diagonal-1 and vein graft to OM-2, who was
transferred to Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable
condition.

On postoperative day one, he continued on his perioperative
Vancomycin and was on the following drips:  Neo-Synephrine at
1 mcg/kg/min, nitroglycerin at 0.25 mcg/kg/min, milrinone at
0.25 mcg/kg/min, and insulin drip for glucose coverage.  He
was extubated the night of operation and the following
morning was in sinus rhythm in the 90s with a blood pressure
of 95/43.  Cardiac index of 2.6 with an intra-aortic balloon
pump at 1:1.  He remained on a face mask with postoperative
laboratories of a hematocrit of 27.5, K of 4.8, and BUN of
18, and creatinine of 0.8.  His heart was regular, rate, and
rhythm.  His respiratory sounds were slightly coarse.  He had
dopplerable pulses in his feet with no signs of ischemia in
his legs.

The plain was to discontinue his milrinone first and try to
wean his balloon later.  He remained in the Intensive Care
Unit.  Diuresis was not started pending his hemodynamic
status following drips and balloon removal.

On postoperative day two, his balloon was removed.  His chest
tubes were removed.  He remained only on a Neo-Synephrine
drip at 0.75 mcg/kg/min.  He was saturating well on nasal
cannula with a good blood pressure and was slightly
tachycardic at 106, but his Lopressor was held until he was
off his Neo-Synephrine and he started his oral medications.
He was transferred 2 units of blood for his hematocrit of
20.8.

He was seen by physical therapy for evaluation and case
management.  On postoperative day three, his hematocrit rose
to 25 after transfusion.  He was restarted on his oral sugar
medications.  He remained tachycardic in sinus rhythm at 105
with a good blood pressure.  He was started on Lopressor 12.5
[**Hospital1 **].  His diet was advanced.  His Foley was removed.  He
began his Lasix diuresis and was transferred to the floor.

On postoperative day four, he continued with his Lopressor
and diuresis.  Remained now in sinus rhythm at 82 with a good
blood pressure.  Hematocrit holding at 24.1 with a BUN of 14
and creatinine of 0.6.  He was alert and oriented.  He was on
po pain medications.  He continues diuresis.

On postoperative day five, he continued to do well and to
improve.  He was ambulating.  His pacing wires were removed.
His incisions were clean, dry, and intact.  His lungs were
clear bilaterally.  He was sating 92% on room air.  He was
receiving Percocet for po pain.

On [**6-15**], postoperative day six, he was discharged to
home in stable condition with instructions to followup with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-24**] weeks, and
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**], his surgeon in four weeks at the

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  65-year-old gentleman with past
medical history significant for neck cancer, admitted to [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for cardiac catheterization
following arrest.  The patient originally was admitted to
[**Hospital3 3583**] following an unwitnessed arrest.  The
patient's wife reports that patient got up to go to the
bathroom.  He did not return and his wife subsequently found
him down unresponsive and approximately five minutes later
EMS found patient to be in asystole.  He was resuscitated
following epinephrine, atropine and lidocaine.  He also got
an aspirin and heparin.  The rhythm strip showed him to be in
the rhythm of atrial fibrillation with a blood pressure
initially of 25/palp and then 60/palp.  The patient was then
taken to [**Hospital3 3583**].  Upon arrival at [**Hospital3 3583**] an
EKG showed inferolateral ST depression.  He was then
transferred to [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for
cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Neck cancer, status post dissection in
[**2141**] and status post chemotherapy and radiation.

MEDICATIONS:  No home medications.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Heparin, lidocaine.

ALLERGIES:  Unknown

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married.  Tobacco use 1?????? packs per day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 92.4??????, heart rate 95,
blood pressure 131/86, respirations - intubated, on
ventilator.  GENERAL:  Intubated and sedated, on vent.
HEENT:  Pupils dilated and non-reactive to light.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly, right breath sounds
slightly decreased as compared to the left.  ABDOMEN:
Decreased bowel sounds.  EXTREMITIES:  Pulses intact in
extremities times four.  NEUROLOGICAL:  Pupils fixed and
dilated, no corneal reflexes, no gag reflexes.  No response
to pain or stimuli.  Areflexic.  Does not withdraw
extremities to pain.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count 7.8, hematocrit
35.7.  Sodium 138, potassium 4.3, chloride 105, bicarbonate
14, BUN 7, creatinine 1.2, glucose 152.  Electrocardiogram -
sinus tachycardia with inferior ST depression at
approximately 2 mm.  Normal axis.  ABG 6.97, 64, 52 on 100%
FIO2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular.  Patient admitted following asystolic
arrest with prolonged down time.  There is significant
concern for patient's neurologic status given his neurologic
exam and his pH of 6.97 at admission.  Initially cardiac
catheterization was held until a further determination of his
prognosis and likelihood of recovery could be determined.
His arrest was thought to be likely ischemic with his lateral
ST depressions versus primary arrhythmia.  The patient was
monitored.  He had an echo which showed an ejection fraction
of 50% and significant valvular disease.  The patient was
monitored supportively and further cardiac intervention was
not undertaken given his neurologic status.

2.  Neurology.  Patient admitted unresponsive with no brain
stem functions.  However, he did not meet the criteria for
brain death.  Patient continued to decline neurologically and
began to develop wide temperature fluctuations and autonomic
dysfunction.  Patient was thought to have hypothalamic
dysfunction due to his severe anoxic brain injury.  Neurology
was consulted and patient was thought to have a very poor
prognosis, supportively, until he suffered the
cardiorespiratory arrest.

3.  Severe acidosis.  Patient admitted with an pH of 6.97.
This was thought to represent severe lactic acidosis in the
setting of prolonged hypoxia and asystolic arrest.  He was
maintained supportively.

DISPOSITION:  Patient transferred to the IDMC following the
asystolic arrest with prolonged down time in the field.
Patient was severely acidotic and had minimal intact
neurologic function.  His status rapidly declined following
admission to the CCU and he developed severe autonomic
dysfunction thought to be due to his anoxic brain injury.
Patient then suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Cardiogenic shock, status post acute
inferior myocardial infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old male with
a history of diabetes and coronary artery disease (status
post coronary artery bypass graft times three in [**2147-5-22**],
status post right coronary artery stent times two in
[**2148-9-21**], and status post percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty of the left anterior descending artery
in [**2149-7-21**]) who presented with 10/10 chest pain
(persistent pressure similar to his past acute myocardial
infarction) starting around 8 o'clock in the morning on the
day of admission.

He was seen in his primary care physician's office and was
sent to the Emergency Room directly.  In the Emergency Room,
his temperature was 98.3, blood pressure was 183/65, pulse
was 94, respiratory rate was 12, and oxygen saturation was
97% on room air.  His initial electrocardiogram was
unremarkable.  He was given sublingual nitroglycerin for his
chest pain.  However, in the Emergency Room, his systolic
blood pressure dropped to the 50s and heart rate went down to
the 40s.  His repeat electrocardiogram showed high-grade
atrioventricular block with acute inferior myocardial
infarction.  He was given atropine and dopamine for
bradycardia and hypotension in the Emergency Room, and he
went into supraventricular tachycardia.

He was brought to the catheterization laboratory directly for
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.  During the
catheterization, an intra-aortic balloon was placed for blood
pressure support, and he was intubated for airway protection.
He also required pressors including Neo-Synephrine and
dopamine during the catheterization.  A transvenous temporary
pacing wire was also placed during the catheterization.  His
proximal right coronary artery (which was totally occluded
with thrombus) was successfully stented with normal flow.  At
the end of the catheterization, his heart rate remained
stable off pacer, and blood pressure remained stable off
pressors.  He was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for
monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease; status post 3-vessel coronary
artery bypass graft in [**2147-5-22**]; status post right
coronary artery stent in [**2148-9-21**]; and status post
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of left
anterior descending artery in [**2149-7-21**].
2.  Diabetes.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
6.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
7.  Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Insulin 75/25 50 units q.a.m. and
30 units q.p.m., Imdur 10 mg p.o. t.i.d., Cozaar 25 mg p.o.
q.d., Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., Zantac 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d., aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  ACE INHIBITOR (cough).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He stopped smoking five years ago.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Denies coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission to catheterization laboratory revealed
temperature was 96.9, blood pressure was 136/71, heart rate
was 133.  In general, intubated and sedated, responsive to
painful stimuli.  Cardiovascular examination revealed normal
first heart sound and second heart sound, tachycardic.  Lungs
revealed breath sounds were equal bilaterally.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Extremities revealed
distal pulses bilaterally by Doppler.  Left groin arterial
and venous sheaths with intra-aortic balloon pump and
Swan-Ganz catheter.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed white blood cell count was 9.6, hematocrit was 48.4,
platelets were 179.  PT was 13.5, PTT was 25.5, INR was 1.3.
Sodium was 136, potassium was 4.5, chloride was 95,
bicarbonate was 31, blood urea nitrogen was 9, creatinine
was 0.7, and blood glucose was 414.  Calcium was 8.7,
magnesium was 1.5, phosphate was 4.2.  Albumin was 3.9, total
bilirubin was 0.7, ALT was 20, AST was 14, alkaline
phosphatase was 85, lipase was 13, amylase was 24, LD
was 196, creatine kinase was 45 (which later peaked at 1081).
Arterial blood gas revealed 7.31/47/358 on ventilator with
FIO2 of 0.8.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram revealed ST elevations
in II, III, and aVF; ST elevations in I and aVL; right-sided
electrocardiogram showed ST elevations in leads V2 through
V6.

Catheterization in [**2148-9-21**] revealed 3-vessel
coronary artery disease, patent left internal mammary artery
to left anterior descending artery, and saphenous vein graft
to obtuse marginal.  Total occlusion of saphenous vein graft
to right coronary artery.  Normal ejection fraction of
about 60%.  Successful percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty and stenting of the distal right coronary artery
and direct stenting of the mid right coronary artery.

Catheterization in [**2149-7-21**] revealed 2-vessel coronary
artery disease, patent left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal.  Severe diastolic dysfunction.  Successful
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of 80% left
anterior descending artery stenosis just distal to the
anastomosis.  Ejection fraction was about 70%.

Catheterization on admission revealed left main coronary
artery was normal, left anterior descending artery with
severe proximal disease, left circumflex was nondominant with
total occlusion of the first obtuse marginal.  Right coronary
artery was dominant vessel with proximal total occlusion with
thrombus.  The proximal right coronary artery was
successfully stented.  Right heart catheterization showed
right atrial mean pressure of 19, pulmonary artery pressure
of 57/40, with a mean pressure of 49, wedge of 28.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was weaned off pressors and intra-aortic
balloon pump quickly in the Coronary Care Unit.  Metoprolol
and Cozaar were added as his blood pressure tolerated.  The
18-hour course of post catheterization Integrilin had to be
stopped prematurely due to epistaxis.  He also developed
severe laryngeal edema secondary to traumatic intubation on
admission.  He was evaluated by Ear/Nose/Throat and treated
with a dose of intravenous Solu-Medrol with significant
improvement.  He was extubated on hospital day five without
any difficulty.  He was also treated with a 7-day course of
Levaquin for possible aspiration pneumonia given the
prolonged course of intubation and a low-grade temperature.

His cardiac enzymes trended downward throughout the hospital
stay with a peak creatine kinase of 1081 and CK/MB of 125.
Repeat echocardiogram showed inferoseptal hypokinesis with an
ejection fraction of 55%.  No evidence of ventricular septal
defect.

On the day of discharge, he was evaluated by Physical Therapy
and deemed stable to go home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post acute inferior myocardial infarction with
right ventricular infarct; status post proximal right
coronary artery stent.
2.  Diabetes.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.

proximal right coronary artery, who presents with an episode
of acute onset [**10-30**] substernal chest pain.

The patient reports acute onset of substernal chest pain with
radiation down both arms.  The pain began approximately one
hour prior to presentation.  Pain was associated with nausea,
syncope, diaphoresis, shortness of breath, and chills.  The
patient was transported to the Emergency Department by EMS
and on route, was found to have a blood pressure of
60/palpation and complete heart block with a ventricular rate

continuing with physical exam.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: Temperature 98.8; heart
rate 79; blood pressure 123/80; respiratory rate 16; oxygen
saturation 95% on room air.  In general, the patient is an
obese male in no acute distress lying at 30 degrees.  HEENT
exam: Normocephalic, atraumatic, anicteric sclerae, pupils
are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation,
clear oropharynx, dry mucous membranes.  Neck exam:  Elevated
jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy, supple.
Pulmonary exam:  Expiratory wheezes predominantly on the
right otherwise clear to auscultation with no rales noted.
Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm with normal S1,
S2, positive S4, no murmurs appreciated.  Abdominal exam:
Obese, soft, normoactive bowel sounds, nontender, mildly
distended.  Extremities:  Intra-aortic balloon pump in place
with right femoral artery catheter.  No ecchymosis or
hematoma noted, 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses
bilaterally, warm and well perfused extremities.

LABORATORY AND STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  CBC with a white blood
cell count of 9.2; hematocrit 38.6; platelets of 284; Chem-7
with a sodium of 140; potassium 4.3; chloride 98; bicarb 32;
BUN 12; creatinine 1.1 with glucose of 408; Coags with a PT
of 13.2; INR of 1.2 and PTT of 25.5.  Initial ABG at the
outside hospital with a pH of 7.27; CO2 76; O2 of 341 on a
100% nonrebreather.  ABG during cardiac catheterization:  PH
of 7.28; CO2 65 and O2 of 70 on one liter nasal cannula.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM:  On [**2149-11-3**] notable for a moderate
left atrial dilatation, moderate left ventricular dilatation,
moderate dilatation of the aortic route, left ventricular
ejection fraction of 45%, and mild pulmonary artery
hypertension.

CHEST X-RAY:  On admission notable for cardiomegaly with no
signs of pulmonary edema, effusion, or infiltrate.
EKG:  At the outside hospital notable for a complete heart
block with sinus bradycardia and junctional rhythm at 38 to
42, normal axis, ST elevations inferiorly with reciprocal ST
depressions in the lateral precordium, leads I and aVL.
Right sided EKG notable for a [**Street Address(2) **] elevation in lead R, V4
consistent with a right ventricular infarct.

POST CATHETERIZATION EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm at 84 with
left atrial dilatation, diminished inferior voltage, new
T-wave inversions inferiorly with resolution of the ST
elevations inferiorly.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient went for emergent cardiac
catheterization.  The patient's left heart cardiac
catheterization demonstrated proximal right coronary artery
total occlusion with acute thrombus and distal right coronary
artery clot in a distal stent.  The patient underwent
Angioject with balloon dilatation of clots in three right
coronary artery stents with subsequent stent overlay of the
proximal RCA stent in restoration of TIMI three flow.  An
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed for after load
reduction.  The patient also underwent a right heart
catheterization with demonstration of elevated failing
pressures; right atrial pressure 22; right ventricular
pressure 61 / 13; pulmonary artery pressure 62 / 36; and
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22.  A Swan-Ganz
catheter remained in place.

POST CATHETERIZATION:  Continued to monitor the patient's
volume status.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was started on Integrilin (18
hours); Plavix; and Heparin and was transferred to the
Cardiac Intensive Care Unit for further management.

The patient ruled in for an ST elevation myocardial
infarction with a peak CK of 1,742.  The patient remained
chest pain free throughout the remainder of the hospital
course.  The patient was continued on aspirin and Lipitor and
was started on an insulin drip for blood glucose control
while in the Critical Care Unit.  The patient maintained
adequate blood pressure on the intra-aortic balloon pump with
mean arterial pressures in the range of 70 to 80.

On hospital day #2:  The patient was restarted on his home
dose of angiotensin receptor blocker for continued after load
reduction.

Hospital day #3:  The intra-aortic balloon pump was removed.
The patient was subsequently restarted on a low dose beta
blocker with no further evidence of complete heart block.
A transthoracic echo was performed which demonstrated mild to
moderate decreased left ventricular function with an ejection
fraction of 40% secondary to severe hypokinesis of the left
ventricular inferior free wall and posterior wall.  The echo
also demonstrated severe global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis with contractile dysfunction, mild left atrial
dilatation, mild left ventricular symmetric hypertrophy, mild
dilatation of the aortic route, and trivial mitral
regurgitation.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2148-12-3**] 10:49 AM
CONCLUSION
1. Moderate size hematoma in the subcutaneous tissues of the
right groin. No pelvic or intra-abdominal hematoma.
2. Large hernia containing two separate segments of colon.
3. Mild circumferential thickening along part of the ascending
colon partly located within the abdomen and within the right
inferolateral abdominal wall hernia with mild adjacent stranding
compared to previous CT. No sign of mechanical obstruction.
Possibilities would include an area of focal segmental
congestion or even colitis depending on clinical correlation.
4. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 3.9 cm
transverse unchanged.
5. Moderate right basal pleural effusion and minor associated
right posterobasal atelectasis.
6. Cholelithiasis.

ECHO [**2148-12-2**]
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Left
ventricular chamber size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is probably
borderline normal (EF~50-55%) but views are technically
suboptimal. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be
more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is severe aortic valve stenosis (estimated [**Location (un) 109**] ~0.6 cm2 but LVOT
velocity estimation is technically limited) . There is no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: This is a 84 year old female with severe AS (0.8), chronic
lymphoma, DVT on coumadin, asthma who p/w s/p fall and complete
heart block. Now s/p DDD pacer.
.
#Cardiovascular -
#Ischemia - no previous history of ischemia. Continued on ASA
325.
# Pump - Recieved 3U FFP. Attempt at RIJ for temp wire
unsuccessful. Pt became hypotensive during attempt at RIJ temp
wire requiring max dose dopamine and neosynephrine gtt's.
Hypotension was thought to be secondary to increased vagal tone
with pressure and manipulation at the RIJ. Patient was intubated
for airway protection in setting of right neck hematoma. Patient
was subsequently weaned off pressors. Repeat ECHO showed
preserved EF 50-55%, tight AS valve area 0.6 cm2. Patient became
hypotensive and required fluid boluses and resumed on dopamine
ggt temporarily after removal of right femoral sheath and right
groin hematoma was seen on CT. Patient was resumed on diltiazem
and was diuresed with IV lasix with goal of -500cc/day.
# Rhythm - Noted to have 8 sec run of non-conducted P's
(assymptomatic). Baseline ECG reveals bifasicular block with
prolonged PR. Admitted to CCU for CHB. Received temp wire in R
groin under fluoro. Patient had PPM (DDD) placed on [**2148-12-3**].
.
##Respiratory - S/P Intubation for airway protection given
hematoma in neck. Initially propofol used for sedation, however
was changed to fentanyl and versed with better effect. Patient
was extubated sat'ing well on room air. Continued advair,
ipratropium and albuterol NEB PRN.
.
##Hematomas - Patient developed multiple hematomas at access
sites including RIJ, left forearm, right groin and left chest
(pacer site). Bleeds stopped with pressure bandages, FFP and vit
K. Abdominal CT showed right groin bleed and no RP/intrapelvic
bleed. Anticoagulation was held and patient was transfused as
needed.
.
## AS:  Severe with area of 0.8, mean gradient 50's. CT surgery
was consulted and spoke with patient who said that she does not
wish to go to surgery at this time.
.
## UTI:  Enterococcus 100K, PROVIDENCIA RETTGERI 10-100K on ucx.
Was on vanco 1g for 48 hours perioperatively. Completed 1 week
of ampicillin for Entercoccus UTI and levoquin 4 days,for GN
coverage.
.
## Anemia: Labs consistent with iron def anemia. Started PO iron
repletion. In an elderly with iron def. anemia concerning for GI
origin and should have outpt workup.
Patient received blood after decreased Hct after RIJ attempt, R
femoral groin cordis removal and left chest hematoma at pacer
site. Hct now stable and patient off coumadin.
.
## [**Name (NI) 14572**] - Pt with h/o dvt (dx'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**2148-6-12**]) and
anticogulated with coumadin on admission, INR was 2.5. Coumadin
was held and patient was put on heparin gtt.
Patient received FFP prior to central line placement and after
right groin bleed. Patient also received vit K prior to PPM
placement and s/p right groin bleed and heparin ggt was held.
Initially patient was started on coumadin with heparin bridge
however had pacer bleed and so coumadin and heparin were held
given bleeding risks.
.
## Falls:  Likely [**2-14**] CHB.  Head scan negative.  PT consult,
will need to go to rehab.
.
## PPX: colace/senna PRN

flexion response to plantar reflex. Pupils 4-->3, equal (were
unresponsive immediately after code).


Pertinent Results:
[**2149-11-29**] 10 PM CXR: IMPRESSION: Interval placement of
endotracheal tube with distal tip in appropriate position. The
previously noted patchy opacity in the lateral left lung base is
not included on the current radiograph secondary to positioning.

.
[**2149-11-29**] PA and lat CXR: IMPRESSION: Small left pleural effusion
and left retrocardiac opacity representing atelectasis versus
pneumonia. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
.
[**2149-11-30**] CT: wet read - head negative for acute process; CTA
chest negative for PE or dissection. ? low lung volumes in left
chest and left ventricular mass that could be LVH. Abdominal
scan notable for hernia; no acute change in AAA; no ascites.
.
ECG: a-sensed, v-paced at 74 bpm, wide QRS.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:
  The etiology of the patient's PEA arrest was not obvious. She
was rescuscitated, and transferred to ICU when stabilized. In
the ICU, a R subclavian was ultimately placed - the patient had
very difficult access. A CXR ruled out a pneumonthorax. The ECG
showed normal voltage, though paced, making tamponade less
likely. The CTA was  without evidence of PE. The cardiac enzymes
were not suggestive of an acute MI. Cardiology was consulted.
Interrogation of the pacer revealed that at approximately the
time of the incident, she had a 13 minute episode of atrial
tachycardia suggestive of afib; however, there was no way to
know for certain what rhythm she was in. It was felt that,
perhaps, afib coupled with underlying severe AS may have
resulted in hypoxia leading to PEA arrest. Once resucitated, she
was able to maintain a BP without pressors, and remained
intubated.
  However, she did not regain her mental status over the
subsequent days despite being on minimal sedation (0.5 versed)
or at times completely without sedation. At most, she would open
her eyes and move, but no reproducible purposeful movements or
ability to follow commands was seen.  A discussion was had with
the family regarding withdrawal of aggressive measures and
providing comfort measures only.  The family concurred with this
course of action and the patient was extubated on [**2149-12-3**].  All
medications save for nebulizers and morphine were stopped.  The
patient was transferred from the unit to the floor on [**2149-12-4**].
On the morning of [**2149-12-5**] at 9:26 am the patient passed away on
a morphine gtt. Her daughter, [**Name (NI) 14573**], her HCP, was notified and
declined an autopsy.

Service:  Cardiothoracic Service

CHIEF COMPLAINT/HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a
59 year old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy
who presented to an outside hospital with a history of
dyspnea on exertion times one week and bilateral lower
extremity edema.  The patient initially attributed these
symptoms to his asthma, however, when the symptoms continued
to worsen and he was short of breath at rest, he presented to
the hospital.  At that time he denied chest pain,
palpitations, sharp pain or any extremity pain.  Chest x-ray
at that time showed congestive heart failure.  He was given
Lasix with no change in his shortness of breath but a marked
decrease in his lower extremity edema.  Arterial blood gases
at that time was 7.45, 40, 56, with an AA gradient of 24.  An
echocardiogram and stress test were ordered at that time.
Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 19%.  Stress
test showed reversible inferior wall defect.  The patient was
then transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for
cardiac catheterization and further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for ischemic
cardiomyopathy, mitral regurgitation, mild to moderate aortic
stenosis, diabetes mellitus, and asthma.

ALLERGIES:  He states an allergy to Sulfa.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Glucophage 500 mg t.i.d., Slo-[**Hospital1 **]
no dose given, Ventolin nebulizer, Aspirin 81 mg a day, Lasix
intravenously at an outside hospital.  Coreg 3.125 mg and
Lisinopril 5 mg q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, smokes times 40 years, recently
quit.  Works as a sales executive.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After admission to [**Hospital6 649**] the patient was brought to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory.  Please see the catheterization
results for full details.  In summary the catheterization
showed a cardiac output of 4.45 with an index of 2.2 and
wedge of 13.  PA is 38/21.  Coronaries showed left main with
a 70% lesion, left anterior descending with mild disease,
circumflex with no critical lesions and right coronary artery
with mid segment total occlusion with distal flow from the
left anterior descending.

Physical examination on admission - General, white man in no
acute distress, alert and oriented times three.  Pupils
equal, round and reactive to light.  Chest clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  Cardiovascular, distant
heartsounds, S1 and S2, abdomen soft with positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities, no edema, cyanosis or clubbing.

Laboratory data at the outside hospital showed the hemoglobin
A1c of 10.6, arterial blood gases 7.45, pCO2 39, pO2 55,
white count 5.8, hematocrit 42.9, platelets 387, sodium 137,
potassium 4.3, chloride 101, carbon dioxide 24, BUN 16,
creatinine 0.8, glucose 310.  Liver function tests were
normal.  Creatinine kinase and troponin were negative times
three.  Cholesterol 215.  HDL 82.  LDL 122.  The patient had
a Persantine Myoview which showed an estimated ejection
fraction of 19%, grossly dilated left ventricular with
multiple perfusion defects, septal and inferior lateral walls
with reversibility in the inferior and lateral wall.
Echocardiogram done showed an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%
with a dilated left ventricle and mitral regurgitation.

Given these results along with the patient's cardiac
catheterization, intra-aortic balloon pump was placed and
following catheterization the Cardiothoracic Surgery Service
was consulted.  The patient was seen and accepted for
coronary artery bypass grafting +/- mitral valve replacement.
On [**2-13**], the patient was brought to the Operating Room
where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft times three
with mitral valve annuloplasty.  Please see operative report
for full details.  In summary, the patient had a coronary
artery bypass graft times three with left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft
to the posterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to
the diagonal and mitral valve annuloplasty with a #28 band.
He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred from the
Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At
the time of transfer, the patient had an intra-aortic balloon
pump at 1:1, Propofol, Milrinone and Levophed infusing.  The
patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.  The
patient was kept sedated on the night of his surgery.  On the
morning of postoperative day #1 sedation was discontinued.
The patient was weaned from the ventilator and successfully
extubated.  He remained hemodynamically stable with the
assistance of the intra-aortic balloon pump as well as
Neo-Synephrine and Levophed drips.  The patient was also
started on Amiodarone for frequent premature atrial
contractions.  On postoperative day #2, the patient continued
to remain hemodynamically stable.  His intra-aortic balloon
pump was weaned and successfully removed.  Over the next
several days, the patient remained hemodynamically stable.
His pressors were weaned to off with the exception of his
Milrinone which continued to be weaned very slowly and on
postoperative day #5, was ultimately discontinued.  During
this time, gentle diuresis was begun.  Following the
discontinuation of Milrinone, the patient began to be more
vigorously diuresed and his ACE inhibitor was begun.  On
postoperative day #5 the patient doing well and it was
decided that he was stable and ready for transfer to the
floor for continued postoperative care in cardiac
rehabilitation.  At that time the Heart Failure Service was
asked to consult on the patient to add in the care of Mr.
[**Known lastname 46437**].  Over the next several days with the assistance of
the nursing staff and physical therapy the patient's activity
level was increased.  He continued to be diuresed.  His
medications were adjusted and he remained hemodynamically
stable, and on postoperative day #10 it was decided that the
patient was stable and ready to be discharged to home the
following morning.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  At the time of discharge the
patient's condition was stable.  His physical examination
revealed vital signs with temperature 97.6, heartrate 90,
sinus rhythm, blood pressure 110/70, respiratory rate 18 and
oxygen saturation 94% on room air.  Weight preoperatively was
78 kg, at discharge 78.1 kg.  Laboratory data revealed white
count 9.7, hematocrit 32.9, platelets 741, sodium 135,
potassium 4.2, chloride 98, carbon dioxide 28, BUN 11,
creatinine 0.7, glucose 183.  Neurological, alert and
oriented times three.  He moves all extremities and follows
commands.  Breathsounds are diminished in the left base but
otherwise clear to auscultation.  Heartsounds, regular rate
and rhythm, S1 and S2, sternum stable.  Incision with
Steri-Strips, open to air, clean and dry.  Abdomen soft,
nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities, warm and well perfused.  The right leg incision

Cardiac cath:1. Coronary and grft angiography showed a previous
right
dominant system. The LMCA was diffusely disesed with no focal or

critical lesions. The LAD tapered off in the mid segment until a
large
S2 where it is totally occluded. The D1 and D2 are small vessels
and
are diffusely diseased. The D3 which recived a SVG  is not seen
in the
LMCA injection. The Mid and the distal LAD receives the LIMA.
The Cx
vessel it self has no lesions. It gives a lengthy collateral.
The OM1
arises close to the LMCA and is small. The OM2 too arises close
to the
LMCA and is large. This has a proximal lesion of 80%. The OM3
recives the SVG and is not seen on LMCA injection. The
OM4/postero
latateral branch arises distally and is a small vessel. The RCA
is
occluded proximally. The distal RCA including the PDA and the
PLV are
collateralised by the left system. The PDA is poorly filled and
has a
mid 60% lesion. The LIMA , the LIMA-LAD anastomosis and the
distal LAD
are free of disease. The LIMA fills the LAD retrogradely to
supply the
proximal LAD and the D3. The D3 has an ostial 70% lesion with
TIMI III
flow. The SV grafts to the RCA and the PLB are occluded
completely and
are seen as stumps in the aorta. The graft to the Diagonal could
not be
located, but is likely to be occluded given the other
angiogaphic
findings. The SVG to the OM3 shows diffuse disease with a mid
lengthy
lesion of 99 % and the whole vessel showed TIMI II flow. There
were no
collaterals for this OM.
2. Left ventriculography was not performed.
3. Predilation using 1.5 X 15 Maverick balloon, stenting using
3.0 X 28
and 3.0 X 33 OTW Cypher stents and thrombus extraction using
export
catheter with gradual deterioration of flow of the SVG to the
OM3. The
flow deteriorated from TIMI I to TIMI 0.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel native coronary artery disease with functioning
LIMA to
the LAD.
2. Acute occlusion of the SVG to the OM and chronically occluded
SV
grafts to the PDA, PLB and Diagonal.
3. Unable to restore flow in the SVG to the OM despite stenting,

pharmacotherapy and thrombus aspiration. .
Echo: . The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Basal inferior
hypokinesis is present.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
5. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
ct scan:
1. No evidence of intrahepatic gas as suggested on prior
ultrasound. Repeat ultrasound is suggested given this change in
appearance.
2. Bibasilar dependent atelectatic changes/consolidation with
associated effusions.
3. Gas distended loops of bowel with air-fluid levels but
without transition suggesting ileus. Stool distended rectum.
4. Small infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.




Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted with unstable angina, had total occlusion of all
svg grafts with a patent LIMA to LAD, and received 2 cypher
stents.  His catheterization was compicted by failed thrombus
extractuib abd a TIMI 0.  After catherization he had persistent
CP and evidence of a NSTEMI.  Initially he was not treated with
ASA because of a past GI bleed, but with persistent ischemia, it
was added to the plavix.  He required a significant of morphine
to controll his pain.  Through discussions between the MICU team
and the family pain control was determined to be the only option
for him.  His code status was changed to DNR/DNI/.  Due to
ongoing ischemia, he had persistent hypotension that required
multiple pressors.  His HD was changed to CVVH because of his
low blood presssure.  He also had intermittent NSVT.  He had
been transferred from the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] team to the MICU team due to
hypotension at HD after his cardiac catheterization out of
concern for possible sepsis.  There was a concern that he had an
acute abdomen but he appeared to be impacted with stool.  He was
disimpacted and received an aggresive bowel regimen.  His
distension and pain improved.  He had low grade temperatures and
was initially treated for pneumonia because he was hypoxic.  No
source of infection was identified.  It is more likely that he
was in cardiogenic shock with fluid overload.  A repeat bedside
echo did not reveal worsening ventricular function.  He required
blood transfusions for persistently dropping HCT in the setting
of very frequent blood draws.  He also had a coagulopathy which
did not appear to be from DIC.  He required vitamin K
supplementation.  He expired at 6:45am on [**2108-10-5**] after an
episode of severe chest pain.

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with
known coronary artery disease presenting with chest and
abdominal pressure.  He has had several month history of
exertional angina that was relieved with rest.  He did not
take anything for it.  Last night pain occurred with minimal
exertion and kept him from sleeping.  He has mild shortness
of breath.  No nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis or palpations.
No radiation.  He had been feeling well prior to the onset of
this pressure.

The patient call EMS.  Pain relieved with aspirin and
Nitroglycerin.  Pain entirely relieved in the emergency room
after two sublingual Nitroglycerin.  Due to diffuse
precordial ST depressions, the patient was started on
heparin.

PERTINENT LABORATORY:  Patient's admission creatinine was
1.7, troponin I was 3.3, CK MB was 11.

EKG showed ST depressions in V2 through V6 (3 to 5 mm) and T
wave inversion in I and aVL.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted on [**2198-12-24**] with
complaints of chest pain and SOB.  In the emergency room, the
patient was started on heparin drip for ST elevations noted on
EKG and elevated troponin I and CK MB.  Patient also received
a Cardiology consult at which time it was decided to continue
with the heparin drip and add on aspirin once a day.  To
start catheterization.

Subsequent cardiac catheterization showed severe left main
and three vessel disease.  The LMCA was 80% stenosed
proximally and 60% distally.  LAD diffuse disease with 60%
stenosis.  Left circumflex 70% proximal and total occlusion
after the OM2.  The distal LCX fills via right to leg
collaterals.  RCA of 50% stenosis and osteal; 90% in mid.

At that time, it was advised because of the patient's three
vessel and left main disease to proceed with a coronary
artery bypass graft.  Cardiothoracic Surgery was called and
the risk and benefits of coronary artery bypass graft were
discussed with the patient.
An IABP was placed in the cath lab because of increased pain.
He underwent successful underwent CABG x 3 on [**2198-12-26**]. The
LIMA was placed to the LAD, veins were placed to the Diagonal
branch and the PL branch of the RCA. The circumflex could not
branch and the PL branch of the RCA. The circumflex could not
be grafted. Intraop TEE showed pre CPB ef of 30% with 2+ MR.
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] function was slightly improved. Post operatively he
did well. He was extubated and the IABP was removed. He
progressed slowly but well on the floor. The patient in being
transferred to rehab in good condition, tolerating a diet well
and ambulating with a walker.

posterolateral.  The total cardiopulmonary bypass was 50
minutes.   Total cross-clamp time was 40 minutes.  The
patient was transferred in stable condition, in a normal
sinus rhythm at 80 beats per minute, to the Coronary Recovery
Unit on propofol 30 mcg/kg per minute, and Milrinone 0.25
mg/kg per minute, and nitroglycerin at 0.5 mcg/kg per minute.

On postoperative day one, 24-hour events included the patient
receiving another Swan-Ganz catheter as well as extubated.
The patient was in atrial fibrillation at 99 beats per minute
with a low-grade temperature (with a temperature maximum of
100.8, peak temperature current of 99).

On physical examination, the patient had decreased breath
sounds at the bilateral bases.  Otherwise unremarkable.  The
plan was to wean the patient's dobutamine, and to discontinue
the intra-aortic balloon pump if stable, and to continue with
the amiodarone.

The Renal Service came by to see the patient on postoperative
day one for complaints of labored breathing; at which time
they recommended checking Chemistry-7, magnesium,
phosphorous, and calcium levels, and to continue gentle
diuresis if the patient continued to be dyspneic and
requiring increased oxygen.  They also suggested using Lasix
as needed for his clinical condition.

On postoperative day two, the patient was still a temperature
maximum with a low-grade temperature of 100.6.  The patient
was still in atrial fibrillation; rate controlled.
Twenty-four events included the intra-aortic balloon pump
being discontinued, and administration of Lasix overnight
with good effect.

On physical examination, the patient still had coarse breath
sounds with expiratory wheezing.  The plan was to administer
heparin for the atrial fibrillation, to discontinue the
amiodarone, and to administer oral Lopressor, and to transfer
the patient to the floor.

The Renal Service came by to see the patient again on
postoperative day two; at which time they recommended to
avoid the Lasix for the rest of the day, and his oxygen
saturation was fine with good urine output, and to continue
the Lasix as needed for dyspnea.  They also recommended that
we could packed red blood cells.  They also recommended to
follow up on sodium for worsening hyponatremia, but they felt
that this hyponatremia would improve as his diet was
advanced.

On postoperative day three, the patient was afebrile.  Vital
signs were stable, with no events acutely over the last 24
hours.

On postoperative day four, the patient was still in atrial
fibrillation, rate controlled.  On physical examination, he
had improved coarse breath sounds bilaterally, and the plan
was to increase the patient's Lopressor dose.

Electrophysiology Service came by and saw the patient; at
which time they recommended proceeding with anticoagulation
and rate control.  They also stated that they would
cardiovert if the patient became hemodynamically intolerant.

Later on that day, on postoperative day four, the patient was
noted to have a distended abdomen with a decreased urine
output of about 20 cc to 30 cc that evening.  A Foley
catheter was placed with 600 cc of urine drained, with relief
of the patient's abdominal discomfort.

On postoperative day five, the patient was afebrile, still in
atrial fibrillation at 105 beats per minute.  On physical
examination, the patient still had decreased breath sounds at
both bases which were coarse.  His abdomen was still somewhat
distended without tympany with decreased breath sounds.  The
plan was to continue the heparin for the patient's atrial
fibrillation, and to start the Coumadin, and to continue the
Lopressor.

Cardiology Service came by to see the patient on
postoperative day five at which time they agreed with the
anticoagulation, and the Coumadin administration, as well as
the beta blockers.

On postoperative day six, the patient with no acute events
overnight.  The patient was still in atrial fibrillation at
70 beats per minute and still with coarse breath sounds
bilaterally.  The plans were to get the patient ready for
rehabilitation.

On postoperative day seven, the patient was still in atrial
fibrillation at 60 beats per minute.  Otherwise,
hemodynamically stable, saturating at 95% on room air.  The
patient's preoperative weight was 77 kg; currently at 83.3
kg, with 2+ pitting edema bilaterally of the lower
extremities.  The plan was to continue the Lasix for the
patient's edema and coarse breath sounds.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yoM w/ CAD s/p CABG, AF and HTN who presented s/p mechanical
fall  and was found to have hypotension which resolved with 1 L
of NS and  PNA.

Pneumonia: CRX concerning for RML mass on top of PNA which may
be multilobar with also LLL involvement. Responding to
levofloxacin with rapid clinical imporvement and now nl room air
oxygen.
- Continued on levofloxacin renally dosed
- A CT was performed which did not reveal a mass, but showed a
large AAA.

Sepsis: resolved. Lactate improved from 8.3 -> 1.8 and his BP
normalized with only 1 L NS and early antibiotic Tx suggesting
that volume depletion may have been the main culprit.
Blood Cx negative to date.

s/p Fall: pt had witnessed mechanical fall w/o LOC or head
trauma. Head CT and C-spine CT were also negative for new acute
pathology including bleed or fx. Most likely etiology was
weakness from underlying infection.
-Fall precautions were instituted. He was evaluated by PT who
assessed him able to go [**Last Name (un) 6529**] home from the hospital without
any further rehab.

CAD: minimal lateral ST depressions on EKG with positive CK MB
and trop leak, asymptomatic. Possibly demand ischemia caused by
transient hypotension and infection.
- Continued on ASA, lipitor, and BB

HTN: normotensive now. Pt usually on aldactone and BB. He
ignores the doses.
-He was restarted on a low dose of aldactone and lopressor.

CRI: Cr was initially elevated at 1.8 from a baseline of Cr
1.4-1.7. This resolved over 24 hours with hydration and it was
attributed to prerenal etiology

Service:  Medicine

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post fall.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old
female, nursing home resident status post a fall on [**10-23**]
with left hip and left knee pain.  The patient has had a left
hip replacement and revision in the past, is now here with a
left acetabular shell loosening.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, status post
CABG in [**2097**], status post aortic valve replacement in [**2097**],
status post TAH BSO, history of DVT, history of increased INR
on Coumadin with a history of a left leg hematoma, history of
lymph node cancer in the abdomen, diverticulitis, falls,
possible hypertension.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Upon presentation to hospital, Coumadin,
Lopressor, Lasix, Zestril, Aleve.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient supposedly lives at home with
home health aide and uses a motorized wheelchair.  The
patient has a 10 pack year smoking history and quit 40 years
ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon presentation to the hospital,
patient's temperature was 97.9, blood pressure 108/96, pulse
64, respirations 16, 98% on room air.  Patient with no
apparent distress.  Pupils were equal, round and reactive to
light. Neck was supple.  Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Tenderness over left knee, not thigh.  Hip,
range of motion was limited, lower left extremity with
shortening, sternally rotated.  Patient's dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial pulses were not palpable.  Needed to be
evaluated by doppler.  X-ray upon presentation showed a loose
acetabular shell with a question of a loose femoral head.
The patient was on anticoagulation due to her aortic valve
replacement, thus was waiting for her coagulation factors to
be more optimal for operative management of her hip.  During
the waiting period for this, patient suddenly started
complaining of right lower quadrant abdominal pain with
slight nausea but no vomiting.  The patient also began to
have some guaiac positive diarrhea.  On exam the patient had
newly noted right lower quadrant mass 6 by 6 cm.  The patient
was also diaphoretic and cool.  Patient's temperature dropped
to 94, Lactate was 17.5, hematocrit 20 which dropped earlier
in the day on [**10-27**] from 29.3.  The patient was transferred
to the MICU for evaluation for decreased hematocrit,
decreased blood pressure.  The patient at that point in time
also had an NG tube that elicited approximately 200 cc of
coffee ground emesis that cleared with 200 cc of saline.  It
was found upon further evaluation that patient was having a
brisk lumbar artery bleed secondary to her fall.  She is
currently status post an embolization by interventional
radiology for the fall.  Patient remained in the MICU from
[**10-27**] to [**2104-11-1**] and then was transferred to the medicine
floor.

LABORATORY DATA:  Upon presentation to the hospital, white
count was 13, hematocrit 29, INR 4.3, PTT 150, ESR 77, CRP
2.1.  Urinalysis was negative for nitrites, [**5-11**] white blood
cells per high power field.  Chem 7, sodium 136, potassium
4.9, chloride 100, CO2 24, creatinine 2.0, glucose 230.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Ortho:  The patient is status post fall on [**2104-10-23**] with
an acetabular shell slippage and a question of a fem
loosening.  This fall was complicated by a retroperitoneal
bleed from lumbar artery bleed.  She is currently status post
embolization, interventional radiology.  The patient's
orthopedic issues have not been fully treated due to
patient's more acute issues during [**Date Range 12876**].  Upon
discharge from hospital patient's orthopedic issues still
were not treated due to patient's need for continued
rehabilitation secondary to hypovolemic shock.  For questions
concerning orthopedic follow-up, please call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4135**] at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 11262**].

2.  Cardiovascular:  1) Hypovolemic shock - patient was found
to have a lumbar artery bleed, was found to be hypotensive,
diaphoretic.  Patient's hematocrit fell from 29 to 23.4 on
[**10-25**] to 16.  The patient was resuscitated with crystalloid,
5 units of packed red blood cells, 4 units of FFP.  The
patient was started on Dopamine 4 mcg/kg/minute while patient
was fluid resuscitated.  While patient was fluid
resuscitated, the patient required less pressors and
ultimately was weaned off pressors completely.  The patient
has remained hemodynamically stable after pressors were taken
off and patient was adequately fluid resuscitated.  The
patient's blood pressures during the last week of
[**Month/Year (2) 12876**] were in the 140's to 160's/80's to 90's, not
requiring fluid resuscitation, not requiring pressors for
majority of [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay.  2) Aortic valve
replacement - patient was on Coumadin with a questionable
dose of 4 mg upon presentation to the hospital.  The patient
has been on an IV Heparin drip since her presentation to the
hospital.  The patient's Heparin orders were weight based
upon 55 kg with an ideal PTT between 60 and 100.  On [**11-7**] the
patient was switched from Heparin drip to Lovenox 30 mg subcu
[**Hospital1 **].  This should continue for one week and then patient
should be reevaluated to whether patient can be started back
on Coumadin with a question of 4 mg dose.  With questions of
Coumadin dose, please call [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 608**] which was
patient's nurse practitioner [**First Name (Titles) 5001**] [**Last Name (Titles) 12876**].

3.  Respiratory:  Patient went into respiratory failure after
patient went into hypovolemic shock secondary to lumbar
artery bleed.  The patient was intubated and then weaned
appropriately and extubated on [**2104-10-31**].  The patient's
respiratory status remained stable after extubation.  The
patient's respiratory rate remained anywhere between 22 and
28 after patient's extubation.  The patient's oxygen
requirements were decreased from 50% face tent to 35% face
tent.  The patient's oxygen status was always greater than
92% on 30% face tent.  On [**11-7**] it was found that patient's
oxygen status was greater than 92% without face tent, thus
oxygen was weaned appropriately.

4.  GI:  The patient had guaiac positive stool with her right
lower quadrant pain and her hypovolemic shock due to lumbar
artery bleed.  The patient had an acute increase in LFTs
during her hypovolemic shock.  The patient's ALT, AST went
from [**9-15**] respectively to 448 and 524.  Patient's LDH went
up to 1806.  Patient's amylase went from 58 to 123.  This
acute increase in liver function tests were most likely
secondary to shock liver due to hypoperfusion.  After patient
became hemodynamically stable, adequately fluid resuscitated,
patient's liver function tests improved dramatically. The
patient's liver function tests decreased slowly during
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course and on day of discharge patient's
ALT was 53, AST 27, alkaline phosphatase 105, bilirubin 1.7.
The patient was complaining of some right upper quadrant pain
the last week of her [**Hospital 12876**].  A right upper quadrant
ultrasound was done which showed cholelithiasis and no
evidence of cholecystitis.

5.  Renal:  Acute renal failure.  Patient's base creatinine
was 2.0.  Patient went into acute renal failure secondary to
hypoperfusion due to hypovolemic shock.  The patient's
creatinine crept up to 3.5.  Patient's Zestril was held at
that point in time.  After hypovolemic shock patient did have
inadequate urine output secondary to decreased blood
pressure.  As patient lives adequately fluid resuscitated and
improved during the hospital stay, patient's urine output
became adequate and patient's creatinine began to creep
downward slowly and on hospital day #16, [**11-7**], patient's
creatinine reached a nadir of 1.6.  Patient was started on
Captopril on [**11-1**], a low dose of 6.25, po tid which was
increased slowly to 25 mg po tid to help patient's renal
function.  The patient was discharged to home on Captopril 25
mg po tid.

6.  ID:  The patient has remained afebrile during [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course.  The patient actually was hypothermic during
patient's hypovolemic shock with a temperature nadir of 94
degrees. The patient was empirically started on Ceftriaxone,
Flagyl and Vancomycin on [**10-30**] for a question of bowel sepsis
vs pneumonia seen as an infiltrate on chest x-ray.  The
patient's Flagyl and Vancomycin were discontinued on [**11-2**] at
first respectively.  Patient was continued on a 14 day course
of Ceftriaxone for a question of pneumonia.  The patient did
have an increase in white cell count during [**Month/Day (2) 12876**]
with a max of 28.9 with an unclear source of why the white
cell count went up.  There is question of acute phase vs
pneumonia.  Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed no
evidence of cholecystitis.  There is a question of sinusitis
with NG tube placement and tube feeds.  Sinus films were not
done.  Patient's white cell count did start to go down on day
of discharge, [**11-7**].  It went down gradually to 23.1.  Patient
remained afebrile.  A C. diff culture for stool was sent
which was negative.  The patient's central line tip was sent
for culture which is still pending upon discharge.  Patient's
white cell count most likely due to pneumonia.

7.  Neuro:  The patient had a slow return to consciousness
after hypovolemic shock, probably secondary to sedation in
MICU stay, hypotension, metabolic derangement.  There was a
question of a stroke but a head CT was negative for evidence
of stroke.  Patient continued to improve and improved
dramatically from [**11-1**] until discharge, going from being
mildly sedated to being able to answer questions
intelligently, being alert and oriented times three and able
to follow commands.  During patient's MICU stay it was
thought that an MRI and EEG would be needed but with
patient's improvement an MRI and EEG were not done.
Neurology felt that those did not need to be done as well.
The patient will continue to improve as outpatient most
likely.

8.  Fluids, Electrolytes & Nutrition:  Upon patient's
hypovolemic shock patient was made npo.  An NG tube was
placed.  Tube feeds were started on [**2104-10-30**].  The patient
was started on tube feeds with a goal of 40 cc per hour and
held for residuals of greater than 100 cc per hour.
Nutrition continued to follow patient's course and patient's
tube feeds were changed to Ultracal 4% to a goal of 55 cc per
hour as tolerated.  Due to patient's hypovolemic shock and
metabolic derangement and slow return to base function, there
was a question of whether patient was an aspiration risk.
Speech therapy began to see patient on [**11-4**] and on [**11-4**] and
[**11-5**] patient was felt to be an aspiration risk and the NG
tube and tube feeds were continued.  Patient improved on [**11-6**]
and a video swallowing study was scheduled.  Video swallowing
study was done on [**11-7**] which showed that the patient still
had risk of aspiration, thus speech pathology recommended
that patient continue on tube feeds with NG tube for one week
and then retry with an other video swallow to see whether
patient is less of an aspiration risk.  The patient became
hypernatremic during hospital stay with sodium in the max of
150.  At that point in time the patient was started on free
water boluses.  Ultimately 200 cc boluses done q 4 through NG
tube was done and patient's sodium normalized.

9.  Access:  A right subclavian central line was placed.  A
Foley catheter was placed.  An NG tube was placed upon MICU
admission.  All of these things have been removed except
patient's Foley catheter.  An NG tube needs to be placed upon
patient's admission to rehab for tube feeds to continue.
Patient's right subclavian line was pulled and two peripheral
IV's are now present for access.

10. Code Status:  On [**10-31**] it was discussed with patient's
daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] at that point in time was DNR, not DNI.
On [**11-5**] after patient became lucid and was able to answer
questions for herself, the patient wanted to be full code so
thus patient is full code at this point in time.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post fall with acetabular head dislocation,
complicated by lumbar artery bleed, status post embolization
for hypovolemic shock.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient is to be discharged to [**Hospital **]
Rehabilitation.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1266**] will not follow patient while
patient is in [**Hospital1 **].  Patient should continue on tube
feeds, the Ultracal at 55 cc per hour to be held for
residuals of greater than 100 cc.  Patient should continue on
medications on page 1 and should be evaluated for Coumadin
use, change from Lovenox in approximately one week.  For
questions concerning patient's Coumadin, please call [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 608**].  For questions regarding patient's
orthopedic issues, call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4135**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11262**].

ECHO ([**2194-11-14**])
1. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is
severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis to akinesis with some preservation of
lateral wall
motion. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed.
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
.
CXR:
A single portable AP upright view is compared to previous
examination of [**2194-11-11**]. Since the previous exam there
is partial resolution of the pulmonary edema. There are
bilateral pleural effusions. The heart size is mildly enlarged.
There is increased interstitial marking in right apex without
definite evidence of mass.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 83 year-old female with HTN, DMII, HL, CVA, CAD
who presented to the Emergency Department from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with
an acute ST elevation MI in the anterior leads. Patient was
admitted to the cardiac care unit and the following issues were
addressed during her hospital course:

1. CARDIOVASCULAR: Patient with known 3V disease presented with
acute ST elevation MI. Extensive discussion took place between
patient's daughter (health care proxy) and cardiology team, and
it was decided that given comorbidities, risks/benefits or
coronary intervention, and most importantly, goals of
care/patient's wishes, medical management of MI was pursued.
Patient received Plavix load, Aspirin, and was started on
heparin and integrillin drips. Patient had been started on
Levophed drip in ED for blood pressure support which was weaned
off in the CCU. Heparin and Integrillin gtts were discontinued
after CPKs trended down. Patient received 10-20mg IV Lasix on
admission days 1 and 2 for diuresis, given marked crackles on
exam and elevated JVP. Patient was without chest pain during
hospital stay, though difficult to assess completely given
baseline dementia. The day after admission, patient's
hemodynamic status improved significantly (with significant
improvement in lung exam after diuresis), and blood pressure
medications were restored. Patient received an inpatient ECHO
for prognostic value, her EF was severely depressed (EF 25%)
[see full report in Results section].
.
2. MILD LEUKOCYTOSIS/HYPOTENSION ?SEPSIS
Patient presented with mild leukocytosis and hypotension in
setting of acute MI. Other sources of possible sepsis were
pursued and were unrevealing (UA, Blood Cxs, CXR). CXR with 6cm
opactiy in R apex, to be followed as outpatient (Patient's PCP's
office, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14959**] at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, notified on
[**2194-11-15**]); clinically, patient without signs/symptoms of PNA -
they will follow. Leukocytosis resolved without antibiotic
therapy, and patient remained afebrile.
.
3. PSYCHIATRIC
Patient with baseline dementia, who was initially agitated after
admission to CCU. Per daughter, this was likely due to change in
setting. Patient required Haldol for sedation on admission day
1, and was not required on subsequent hospital days. Patient's
EKGs did not manifest QT prolongation. Outpatient Seroquel was
continued, and patient was started on low dose Zyprexa in the
evenings; [**Hospital 100**] Rehab to decide whether continuation of this
therapy will be necessary.
.
4. CVA history
Continue Depakote for seizure prophylaxis
.
5. DIABETES
Strict glycemic control was maintained with QID fingersticks and
insulin sliding scale.

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47 year old
male without any significant cardiovascular history who,
while exercising this morning on the exercise bike at the
gym, slumped over and, according to eyewitnesses, was caught
and lowered by his neighbor.  [**Name (NI) **] was given chest compression
when found to be pulseless by a witness and was defibrillated
times two by a portable defibrillator sensing probably
ventricular fibrillation.  Estimated time to defibrillation
was five to 10 minutes.  He was intubated and transported to
[**Hospital3 20284**] Center.  In the E.D. he was found to be
agitated, dyspneic and unresponsive to commands.  He was
given Lopressor and nitroglycerin.  His agitation and
difficulty ventilating were improved with vecuronium and
Ativan.  He apparently had an exercise tolerance test earlier
this year, exercising to stage 4 without any symptoms.  It
was unclear at the time of admission why this test was
obtained.  His cardiovascular risk factors included use of
tobacco, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.  Hypercholesterolemia.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:  BuSpar.

ALLERGIES:  Unknown.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient was sedated
and intubated.  Vital signs were blood pressure of 102/57,
pulse 90, afebrile, O2 sat 98% to 100% on assist control
ventilation with FiO2 of 60%.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission sodium was 139, potassium 4.4,
chloride 101, bicarb 21, BUN 16, creatinine 1.5, glucose 196.
White blood cell count was 15, hematocrit 48.6, platelets
380.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was emergently taken to the
cath lab where coronary angiography was done which showed a
right dominant system with two vessel coronary artery
disease.  The left main coronary artery was angiographically
normal.  The proximal LAD had discrete 99% stenosis with some
haziness at the distal pole of the lesion suggesting
thrombus.  The remainder of the LAD had mild luminal
irregularities as well as focal 50% stenosis in the mid-LAD.
The first diagonal branch had 50% proximal stenosis.  The
left circumflex artery had mild luminal irregularities and
produced a first obtuse marginal that was of moderate caliber
and had 90% proximal stenosis.  The RCA had mild luminal
irregularities and 30% to 40% mid-RCA stenosis.  The LAD was
stented without dissection and without residual stenosis and
TIMI 3 flow.

Over the course of his stay in the hospital the patient
remained hemodynamically stable and was successfully
extubated.  He was continued on aspirin and Plavix.
Lopressor and captopril were added to his regimen as
tolerated by his blood pressure.  Repeat echocardiogram
showed left ventricular cavity size to be normal.  Overall
left ventricular systolic function was mildly depressed with
mild septal hypokinesis.  No LV thrombus was seen.  Aortic
valve leaflets were mildly thickened and mitral valve
leaflets were also mildly thickened with 1+ mitral
regurgitation.  In comparison with the previous study there
was marked improvement in LV function.

In light of questionable thrombus on the first
echocardiogram, the patient was started on Coumadin with
cross coverage with heparin.  On day of discharge the
patient's INR was therapeutic at 2.3 and heparin was
discontinued.  During the course of his stay the patient was
also started on Lipitor 10 mg q.day.  During his stay in the
hospital the patient reported some short term memory loss and
was scheduled to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 17804**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in
behavioral neurology clinic.

The patient was discharged home with VNA to help with
medication education and monitoring of INR levels for
anticoagulation.

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70-year-old male with
known coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass grafting 11 years ago who presented with one hour of
substernal chest pain, 10 out of 10 in severity.  He went to
[**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital where electrocardiogram showed
acute inferior myocardial infarction.  He received
................., intravenous Heparin, intravenous
Nitroglycerin, and Plavix.  While he was chest pain free
after these interventions, he was still noted to have ST
elevations on electrocardiogram.  He was therefore
transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for
cardiac catheterization.

Left heart catheterization showed three-vessel disease with
80% left main, 80% proximal left anterior descending, patent
ramus but subtotal circumflex occlusion, and totally occluded
right coronary artery.  There was a saphenous vein graft to
the right coronary artery with diffuse 80% thrombosis and 80%
occlusion after the posterior descending artery anastomosis.
The LIMA was patent to the left anterior descending.
Proximal vein graft thrombus was cleared with an export
catheter, and then a stent was deployed.

Attention was next turned to the distal vein graft lesion
upon which an additional stent was placed.  There was no
residual stenosis seen, and TIMI3 flow was achieved.

Right heart catheterization showed a cardiac output of 3.3
with an index of 1.63, mean wedge pressure of 12, pulmonary
artery pressure of 20/9, right atrial pressure of 11.

Following the procedure, the patient became bradycardiac and
hypotensive requiring Atropine and Dopamine drip and was thus
transferred to the Coronary Intensive Care Unit for further
management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, coronary
artery bypass grafting in [**2119**] at [**Hospital1 2025**], mild hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 25
mg p.o. q.p.m., Colestipol 5 g p.o. q.d., Zocor 20 mg p.o.
q.d., Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  PROTAMINE.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco.  No alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On admission temperature
was 96.6??????, pulse 86, respirations 22, blood pressure 104/63,
oxygen saturation 98%.  He was on a Dopamine and Integrilin
drip.  General:  He was a pale, elderly male lying in bed
complaining of nausea and chest pain, but he was in no acute
distress.  He was alert and oriented times three.  HEENT:
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Moist mucous
membranes.  Neck:  JVP was not seen.  Supple.  No
lymphadenopathy.  Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally listening only anteriorly.  Cardiovascular:
There was a distant S1 and S2.  No S3 or S4.  Regular, rate
and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Groin:
There was a right venous sheath and a left arterial sheath.
There was no hematoma.  No oozing.  No bruits heard.
Extremities:  Distal lower extremity pulses were not
palpable, but dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were
heard on Doppler.  The feet were warm and seem well perfused.
There was no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Neurological:
Cranial nerves II-XII intact.  Strength and motor was not
tested.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 141, potassium 3.8, chloride 104,
bicarb 26, BUN 17, creatinine 1.0, glucose 136, CK 108, MB 9,
troponin T 0.21 at the outside; CBC showed a white count of
8.9, hematocrit 47.2, platelet count 198, differential of the
white count was 50% polys, 40% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, 4%
eosinophils; total protein 7.1, albumin 3.9, bilirubin 0.5,
alkaline phosphatase 68, ALT 20, AST 50; INR less than 1.0,
PTT 26, PT 9.9.

Electrocardiogram at the [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital showed ST
elevations in leads II, III, and AVF.  There was ST
depression in leads I and AVL.  There were Q-waves in leads
III and AVF.  There were T-wave inversions in leads II, III,
and AVF, I, AVL, and V5-V6.  There was frequent ectopy.

After cardiac catheterization at our hospital, the
electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 127 beats per
minute.  There was a [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in lead II and AVF.
There was [**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevations in lead III.  There was 1-[**Street Address(2) 7093**] depression in leads I and AVL, with T-wave inversion in
all limb leads, V5 and V6.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 70-year-old male with coronary artery
disease and coronary artery bypass grafting 11 years ago who
presented with an ST elevation myocardial infarction, who
received .................. Heparin, Plavix, Aspirin, and
Lopressor at the outside hospital resulting in persistent ST
elevations despite becoming chest pain free.

He was transferred here for cardiac catheterization and
received two stents to thromboses in the saphenous vein
grafts to the right coronary system.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiac:  The patient was continued on
Aspirin, Plavix, and statin.  Integrilin was continued for 18
hours after catheterization.  Initially given the patient's
hypotension, he was continued on Dopamine for approximately
36 hours to keep his mean arterial pressure above 60.  He was
given aggressive fluid repletion, as well as 1 U packed red
blood cells for a hematocrit of 28.  The Dopamine was
eventually weaned off, and we initiated low-dose
beta-blockade, as well as ACE inhibitor.

The patient noted some orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea.  Although his lungs were clear, we presumed that he
had become hypervolemic from aggressive fluid repletion
during his episode of hypotension.  We therefore initiated
low-dose Lasix with improvement in his symptoms.

Finally we performed an echocardiogram on hospital day #3.
This showed normal left atrium, normal left ventricular wall
thickness and cavity size, an ejection fraction of 40%, with
inferior and inferoseptal akinesis, with normal right
ventricular chamber size and wall motion.  There was no
mitral regurgitation or aortic regurgitation seen.

We discharged the patient on low-dose beta-blocker and ACE
inhibitor.  These should be increased as tolerated as an
outpatient.  Cardiology follow-up was arranged with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 3236**] at [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital.

Hematology:  The patient was transfused 1 U of blood cells
for a hematocrit of 28.  Following this, his hematocrit
remained stable at approximately 32.

Gastrointestinal:  The patient had considerable nausea with
his hypotension which was treated with Zofran which provided
symptomatic relief.  He was also provided with Protonix for
GI prophylaxis.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 1 p.o. q.d., Zocor 20 mg p.o.
q.d., Colestid 5 g p.o. q.d., Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.,
Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d., Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix
20 mg p.o. q.d., this should be taken for 7 days, then
stopped.  Potassium, BUN, and creatinine should be checked
prior to redosing Lasix.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up with his primary care
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and with his new cardiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3236**].

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Myocardial infarction.
2.  Anemia.
3.  Hypotension.
4.  Status post two stents to existing saphenous vein graft.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD: Pt started on lovenox and transferred here for elective
cath. Left heart ventriculography showed mild mitral
regurgitation; severely hypokinetic anterolateral, anteroapical,
and mid to distal inferior walls; and LVEF 25%. Coronary
angiography showed a right dominant system with LAD with tandem
95% and 90% mid vessel lesions with TIMI 2 flow at the start of
the case, 60% ostial lesion of LCx, large branching OM1 with 80%
stenosis in the upper pole and 85% stenosis in the lower pole at
the birfurcation, and proximally occluded RCA that filled by
left to right collaterals. Pt was s/p anterior MI. CT surgery
was consulted who refused the pt as an operative candidate. The
LAD lesions were stented: 1 cypher stent in the proximal lesion
and 2 pixel stents in the distal lesions, with resulting TIMI 3
flow.
.
At the end of the case, the pt developed respiratory distress
requiring 100 NRB mask, IV Lasix 80mg, and IV NTG. This
progressed to fulminant respiratory failure requiring intubation
with mechanical ventilation. Following induction, the pt became
progressively hypotensive refractory to wide-open dopamine. Pt
as given IV solumedrol, IV benadryl, and IV pepcid for possible
allergic reaction as contributing factor for hypotension. The pt
was taken back to the cath lab and found to have widely patent
LAD stents and no change in anatomy in the LCx and RCA by
collaterals. A IABP was placed in the right FA with diastolic
augmentation to 140mm HG on wide open DA and Neo gtt. right
heart cath showed only mildly elevated right heart pressures
with PCW 18mmHG and entry into the LA by PFO or ASD confirmed by
sats. Bedside echo demonstrated known EF 20-25% and no
hemodynamically important pericardial effusion. There was mild
AI. Pt suffered a large infarction peri-cath secondary to distal
embolization.
.
On HD2, CK peaked at 1864 (Tn 5.92) and trended down. Pt was
continued on ASA, Plavix, heparin, statin. Beta blocker was held
and ACE was not started in the setting of hypotension. Echo
showed severely depressed left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with EF of 20-30%. Echo on [**10-2**] found small apical aneurysm. Pt
was taken off heparin for a couple of days when her platelets
decreased. Platelets normalized. On HD7, heparin was restarted
for her severely depressed EF and apical aneurysm.
.
2. CHF: Pt was transferred to the CCU in cardiogenic shock, as
demonstrated by CO of 2.7 and CI of 1.9 using the swan. Pt was
continued on dopamine and 1:1 IABP. Pt was making good urine
output. Neosynephrine was weaned off and levophed was added. Pt
presented in heart failure as seen on chest x-ray. Echo
performed on [**9-28**] showed severely depressed left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with EF of 20-30%; no pericardial effusion
was seen. Repeat echo on [**9-29**] showed a new moderate sized
pericardial effusion which was echo dense, consistent with
blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Serial echos showed
decrease in pericardial effusion. Pt was weaned off of both
dopamine and levophed. On HD4, IABP was removed. Pt was off
pressors for 14 hours prior to restarting dopamine. Dopamine was
weaned off. Pt was off pressors for 15 hours prior to requiring
levophed. During this time, pt was diuresed with prn IV Lasix
with good urine output. On HD7, swan was resited in setting of
new fevers and question of infection. Swan numbers with PCW of
27 were consistent with continued heart failure. Pt remained on
levophed. Pt had multiple episodes of sinus tachycardia with
rate-related left bundle branch block. On HD7, pt became
progressively hemodynamically unstable requiring increasing
doses of levophed, up to 0.400. Swan numbers showed
significantly depressed cardiac index of 1.5 and increased SVR
of 2200. Pt was started on milronone. She became tachycardic
during milronone bolus. Bolus was stopped and milronone drip
started. Repeat swan numbers revealed CI and SVR back to 2.7 and
1032. On HD8, milronone discontinued. Pt continued to have
tenuous hemodynamics, very pressor dependent, with little
progress. Family meeting took place on HDi and decision was made
to make pt DNR. No progress made overnight. On HD9, family
meeting took place and decision was made to make pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].
Pressors were discontinued and pt was extubated. She passed away
shortly thereafter.
.
3. Rhythm: Pt had transient episodes of sinus tachycardia with
rate-related left bundle branch block, related to even the
smallest amount of stimulation and manipulation. HR would
spontaneously decrease to 80-90s.
.
4. ID: Initially, sepsis was considered as source of hypotension
given elevated WBC of 30. However, pt was afebrile without
source of infection. Initially, pt was pan-cultured and started
on broad spectrum empiric antibiotics, which were discontinued
on HD3, after patient remained afebrile and cultures remained
negative. On HD6, pt developed fevers to 101.4. Blood cultures
sent off and pt started on empiric Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
Cultures continued to remain negative. On HD7, pt continued to
spike temperatures, had elevated BS, and hypotension requiring
slight increase in levophed. Swan numbers were not consistent
with septic physiology. Vancomycin was added for additonal
coverage. Initial swan was removed and new swan was placed.
Given LLL consolidation suggestive of PNA seen on CXR, levo was
discontinued and switched to ceftazidime for coverage of
pseudomonas. Sputum culture grew gram positive cocci in
pairs/chain, GPC in clusters, and gram negative rods. Blood and
urine cultures remained without growth and no definite source of
infection identified.
.
5. Respiratory failure: Pt developed acute respiratory failure
after cardiac catheterization most likely secondary to acute
heart failure. Pt was intubated on HD1. Pt remained intubated.
On HD5, attempt made to wean to pressure support, which she did
not tolerate as she become tachycardic. Pt remained on assist
control with adequate ventilation. Pt was extubated on HD9 and
pt passed away shortly after.
.
6. Heme: On admission to CCU, pt's hct was 32. Hct dropped to 27
on [**2172-9-30**], for which she got 1 unit with appropriate increase
to 30. Platelets on admission to CCU was 258. Pt had transfused
1 unit of platelets on HD1 prior knowing platelet value.
Platelet counts subsequently steadily decreased to nadir of 60s
on HD4 when it was decided to discontinue heparin. Platelet
counts steadily increased. HIT antibodies were found to
negative. Decrease in plt felt to likely to be from integrillin
and shearing by IABP. Heparin was restarted on HD7. Hct remained
between 27-30.
.
7. DM: Pt initially presented with hyperglycemia of 732.
Possible etiologies include recent steroids, sample drawn from
vein close to drips containing dextrose, acute stress. Less
likely from DKA, given the fact that glucose quickly normalized.
Pt was continued on insulin drip with good blood glucose levels.
On HD7, pt went up on insulin requirements with BS in 200s.
.
8. Metabolic acidosis: Pt initially presented with elevated
lactate of 4.4. most likely secondary to decreased tissue
perfusion. By HD2, acidosis was significantly improved. Pt had
no further issues.
.
9. Hyponatremia: Pt initially presented with hyponatremia with
sodium of 125. This is most likely secondary to CHF and
hyperglycemia of 732. Sodium subsequently normalized.
.
10. FEN: Pt was given tube feeds during this hospitalization.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79 year-old
male with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure,
porcine aortic valve placed in [**2150**] who presents to [**Hospital1 1444**] on [**2170-4-2**] with a day
and a half history of shortness of breath and dyspnea on
exertion with chest pressure.  He denies any nausea,
vomiting, diaphoresis, cough, fevers or chills at that time.
He denies any changes in diet, no melena, no bright red blood
per rectum.  Chest x-ray on admission showed mild congestive
heart failure.  He was gently diuresed.  He was found to have
a troponin leak of 2.2.  The patient was taken to cardiac
catheterization where his O2 sat dropped to the 70% when he
laid down and he was intubated.  On cardiac catheterization
no hemodynamically significant lesions were found.  The
patient became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in
the 60s and a low cardiac output and low cardiac index.  An
intraaortic balloon pump was placed.  The patient's cardiac
index dropped even further.  An emergent echocardiogram was
done showing 3+ aortic insufficiency to 3+ mitral
regurgitation.  The intraaortic balloon pump was removed.
Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted, pressors were started.
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for
stabilization.  During cardiac catheterization the wedge
pressure was 36, right atrial pressures the mean was 18,
pulmonary artery pressure mean of 27, right ventricular
pressure was 63 and 4 with a mean of 19.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, the patient
underwent a coronary artery bypass graft in [**2150**] with
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal one and right
coronary artery.  During that time he also had his aortic
valve replaced with a porcine valve in [**2165**].  He had a
myocardial infarction with three stents placed to the right
coronary artery and saphenous vein graft.  He was again
stented in [**2167-9-6**].  In [**2167-11-6**] he was found
to have atrial flutter and a pacemaker was placed.  He was
diagnosed with congestive heart failure in [**2167**].  Recent
echocardiogram in [**2169-11-5**] showed an ejection
fraction of 30% with 1+ aortic regurgitation, 3+ mitral
regurgitation.  Basal inferior and inferior lateral
hypokinesis with septal hypokinesis, apical hypo and
akinesis.  He had chronic anemia with a baseline hematocrit
of 29.  He has a hiatal hernia that was repaired, lower
gastrointestinal bleed, benign prostatic hypertrophy, chronic
renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.0 to 1.5.

ALLERGIES:  Niacin.  Sulfa, but tolerates Lasix.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  His health care proxy is his daughter.  [**Name (NI) **]
lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] has no tobacco, alcohol or drug
history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was afebrile on transfer to the
Cardiac Care Unit, blood pressure 125/47 on Dopamine and
Levophed.  Heart rate 76.  Respiratory rate 11.  He was on
assist control at 100% FIO2, tidal volume of 700, respiratory
rate 12, PEEP of 5 sating 100%.  He was sedated elderly male.
Jugulovenous distention up to the jaw.  He had crackles
anteriorly bilaterally in the lung bases.  His heart was
irregularly irregular with 3 out of 6 diastolic murmur and
systolic murmur.  His abdomen was soft, normoactive bowel
sounds.  Extremities were cold with 1+ pitting edema.  He had
1+ posterior tibial pulses, dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.  He was sedated.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 5.7, hematocrit 34.9, 44%
neutrophils, 28% lymphocytes, INR 2.2, platelets 142, PTT
132.4.  Chemistries sodium 138, potassium 4.9, chloride 102,
bicarbonate 26, BUN 55, creatinine 2.1, glucose 129, calcium
8.9, phos 5.9, magnesium 2.3.  CKs during the hospital course
were 197 to 144 to 126 with troponin less then 0.3, 0.8 and
then third set 2.2.  Arterial blood gas 7.40, CO2 33, O2 of
217 on FIO2 of 100% on assist control.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiac
Care Unit.  His pressor regimen was switched to Milrinone for
the inotropic and vaso dilatation effect as well as
Neo-synephrine for the pressor effect.  His map was
maintained above 60 throughout the first night.  Blood
cultures were sent, urine cultures and urinalysis were sent.
Cardiothoracic surgery reevaluated the patient and still felt
that the patient was unstable for the Operating Room.  He
underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram, which showed no
atrial septal defect, mild focal left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior hypokinesis, no aortic dissection
and a flailing of aortic leaflet with 3+ aortic
regurgitation, 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation.  No vegetations
were seen.  The patient was also started on a Lasix drip for
diuresis given his high wedge pressure.  His FIO2 was weaned
down to 60% as tolerated.  A chest x-ray showed a left lower
lobe infiltrate.  He was started on Levofloxacin.  The
patient proceeded to develop splinter hemorrhages and what
seemed like septic emboli to his toes and fingers.  He was
started on Vancomycin to cover him for endocarditis.  Serial
blood cultures were sent.  The patient remained in critical
condition on two pressors.

Infectious Disease Service was consulted who recommended
covering with Vancomycin, continuing to follow up with the
blood cultures.  The grim prognosis was discussed with the
family.  The family expressed that the patient expressed
clearly prior to this episode that he would not want to be on
a machine and he would not want any aggressive measures.  The
family decided to make the patient do not resuscitate, do not
intubate.  The plan was to extubate him on the morning of [**4-5**] with the family present and to withdraw care at that point,
however, on the night of [**4-4**] the patient extubated
himself.  The decision was made to not reintubate the patient
and the patient expired on [**2170-4-5**] during early morning
around 5:30 a.m.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Cardiac arrest secondary to severe aortic regurgitation
secondary to blown aortic valve.
2.  History of hypertension.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Acute renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis.

This is a partial discharge summary to [**2183-5-18**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 76-year-old male with a
history of MI with systolic dysfunction, EF less than 20%,
hyperlipidemia, AFib, and chronic renal insufficiency, who is
seen in Advanced Heart Failure Clinic and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for
nesiritide tailored therapy.  Patient had gone to [**State 108**] for the
winter in decompensated heart failure with recurrent atrial
fibrillation. Despite promising to seek medical care, he had not
sought cardiology followup in [**State 108**], while decompensating
further.  Patient went up 30 pounds in weight in [**State 108**].
Creatinine was found to be worsening.  Patient walks 10 yards and
is short of breath.

Patient was on admission not on an aspirin or beta-blocker.
Complains of moderate-to-low sodium diet.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
1. Amiodarone 200 mg q.d.
2. Folic acid 1 mg q.d.
3. Atorvastatin 10 mg q.d.
4. Coumadin.
5. Furosemide 80 mg q.d.
6. Lisinopril 5 mg q.d.
7. Started nesiritide

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. CHF:  Systolic EF of less than 20%.
2. Coronary artery disease status post MI in [**2176**].
3. AFib status post on Coumadin.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency.
5. Hypothyroid.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient dates the owner of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1785**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in
[**Location 1268**].  History of smoking.  No alcohol use recently.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature 96.3, blood pressure 90/62, heart
rate 76, respiratory rate 18, and 95% on room air.  Weight
70.6 kg.  Lungs with decreased breath sounds at the right
base half the way up the left base, but not as pronounced,
diffuse crackles.  Irregularly, irregular S1, S2 normal, no
murmur.  Abdomen:  Markedly distended and firm, nontender,
positive bowel sounds, positive fluid wave.  No lower
extremity edema.  Mild non-pitting edema on the left, mild
non-pitting edema on the right.  2+ pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORIES:  Creatinine found to be 3.6 on admission,
hematocrit 33.4.  LFTs unremarkable.  TSH greater than 100.

Chest x-ray showed heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CHF:  The patient was markedly decompensated and up
approximately 30 pounds.  Patient was on Natrecor 0.15, Lasix
drip of 7, and dopamine of 3 mcg to maintain pressure and
kidney perfusion.  Patient had a PICC line placed for these
medications.  Patient was still having difficulty diuresing
and his weight was still around 70 kg at this time.

2. Anemia:  The patient's hematocrit had been stable at
approximately around 33.

3. Ascites:  Plans were to do a paracentesis.  The Coumadin
was discontinued and the INR  allowed to drift down.  This
was going slowly so vitamin K 5 mg subq was given.

4. Coronary artery disease:  We continued his aspirin,
atorvastatin.  The beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor were not
started because he was in such decompensated heart failure
and was so hypotensive.

5. Hyperlipidemia:  We increased his Lipitor to 80 mg q.d.

6. Hypothyroid:  TSH was greater than 100 most likely from
amiodarone toxicity.  We restarted the patient on low-dose
levothyroxine at 25 mcg so that as not to cause any ischemia
to the patient.

7. Atrial fibrillation:  We discontinued the amiodarone
because of thyroid dysfunction, the patient not staying in
sinus rhythm.  We discontinued the Coumadin because of the
hopes of paracentesis next week.  Spoke with the attending
and there was no reason to place the patient on Heparin for
anticoagulation.

8. Chronic renal insufficiency:  Baseline creatinine 1.2-1.7
has been slowly decreasing from 3.6-3.0.  It has not gone
back towards baseline.

9. Full code:  I spoke with the patient and his girlfriend,
who wishes to be his healthcare proxy.  They wish all
measures to be performed.

10. Diet:  He was on a 2-gram sodium diet and restricted to 1
liter of fluid per day.  Electrolytes were repleted as
needed.

The rest of this discharge summary will be dictated at the
time of discharge.

from [**2183-5-17**] to [**2183-5-22**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient as noted in the previous
discharge summary developed worsening renal insufficiency and
worsening liver insufficiency.  He was transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit for inotropic therapy and CVVHD.  He was
started on multiple pressor agents. In the morning of [**2183-5-22**]
the patient underwent a cardiac arrest and was noted to have
pulseless electrical activity.  An attempt at resuscitation
was made, however, it was unsuccessful and the patient was
pronounced dead at 9:35 a.m.

Date of Birth:   [**2094-6-13**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred to [**Hospital6 649**] for workup of right-sided heart failure and
evaluation for possible mitral valve replacement.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old male
with an extensive cardiac history including CABG times three,
mitral valve repair in [**2159**], ejection fraction 30-40%, [**2-1**]+
MR, [**3-2**]+ TR, dilated right and left atria and right
ventricle, history of V tach arrest, now status post AICD
placement, history of sick sinus syndrome, now status post
pacer placement, pulmonary hypertension, systemic
hypertension, chronic atrial fibrillation, and chronic renal
failure, who presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2162-6-8**]
complaining of nausea, vomiting, and increasing abdominal
girth.  He was found to be hypotensive (questionable)
presumably by overdiuresis and was treated with IV fluids,
packed red blood cells and was briefly on pressors.  A CT of
the abdomen showed abdominal ascites with pooling of IV
contrast in the right heart and IVC.  The patient was then
transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**], as
noted above.

Workup of liver etiology of ascites has been negative.
Paracentesis here withdrew 750 cc of transudative fluid.
Cardiac Surgery consult was placed to evaluate the patient
for a possible mitral valve replacement.  The patient was
seen by the Dental Service and was cleared for surgery by
them.  A TTE and a TEE were performed.  The TTE was performed
on [**2162-6-14**] and was mostly consistent with the TEE findings
as will be described below except that the mitral
regurgitation was qualified as 3+ and the tricuspid
regurgitation was 4+.  The TEE was performed on [**2162-6-15**] and
showed a markedly dilated right atrium, dilated right
ventricle, [**12-31**]+ MR, 2+ TR, markedly dilated left atrium,
severely depressed left ventricular function, and a
well-seated mitral valve ring.

As part of the preoperative workup, the patient was sent to
undergo cardiac catheterization.  During that cardiac
catheterization the patient was found to have elevated
bilateral filling pressures.  Measurements were taken pre and
post milrinone with the following results listed
respectively:  Cardiac output 3.88, 4.31; cardiac index 1.77
and 1.9; pulmonary capillary wedge pressures 33 and 28;
pulmonary artery pressure 60/32 and 50/25; right atrial
pressure 25 and 21; left ventricular ejection fraction was
found to be 37% with 4+ MR.  The patient's only patent graft
was found to be his LIMA to LAD and he also had a patent left
main stent which is supplying his left circumflex.

Consequently, he was transferred from the Catheterization
Laboratory to the CCU to undergo milrinone therapy and
aggressive diuresis to optimize him for any surgery that
might take place.  At the time of this dictation, Surgery
evaluation is still ongoing and the final treatment option
for this patient has not been decided upon.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in [**2141**], [**2146**], and
[**2159**].
2.  Cardiac catheterization in [**11-30**], during which the
patient's left main underwent rotational atherectomy and PTCA
with stent placement, slowly with evidence of competitive
flow, midvessel, after takeoff.
3.  Status post mitral valve repair in [**2159**].
4.  Pacer placement in [**2161-4-29**].
5.  AICD placement in [**2162-4-29**] for a V tach arrest which
was DC cardioverted to sinus rhythm during an admission for
CHF exacerbation and hemoptysis.  The pacer placement was for
sick sinus syndrome.
6.  Chronic atrial fibrillation, ejection fraction 25-40%.
7.  Pulmonary hypertension.
8.  Systemic hypertension.
9.  Hypercholesterolemia.
10. Chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 1.3.
11. Gout.
12. Hemoptysis.
13. GERD.
14. Status post appendectomy.
15. Status post right neck mass excision.
16. Status post herniorrhaphy.
17. Iron-deficiency anemia.

ALLERGIES:   Quinidine causes a rash.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
97.6, pulse 66, V paced, blood pressure 103/61, respiratory
rate 15, oxygen saturation 91% on 2 liters, pulmonary artery
pressure 52/27 with a mean of 36, cardiac output 4.1, cardiac
index 1.2.  No focal neurological deficits.  Alert and
oriented times three.  Heart:  Regular heart rate.  No rubs
or gallops.  A positive IV/VI holosystolic mitral
regurgitation murmur.  Extremities:  Marked lower extremity
edema.  Neck:  Positive JVD bilateral. Lungs:  Lower
one-third lung field crackles.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  HEENT:  No icterus.  No pallor.  Mucous
membranes moist.  Right femoral vein cordis with Swan in
place.  Right femoral arterial line.

PERTINENT DATA ON TRANSFER TO CCU:  Hematocrit 33.3, INR 1.6,
creatinine 1.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In addition to the above described in the
history of the present illness, it should be noted that on a
CAT scan performed at an outside hospital there is evidently
a small mass on one of the patient's kidneys which will need
further evaluation after the patient's acute episodes are
resolved.

After transfer to the CCU, the patient was maintained on a
milrinone drip and was started on a Lasix drip.  Over the
first two days, he diuresed 8 liters of fluid with
improvement in his cardiac index and his pulmonary artery
pressures.  He was continued on his beta blocker, ACE
inhibitor, Aldactone, Zaroxolyn.  His Plavix and Coumadin
were held in anticipation of surgery and heparin was not
started as the patient was maintaining an INR of 1.6 to 1.8
on his own.  A Swan-Ganz was eventually re-sited to the right
IJ to allow the patient more mobility.  His right femoral
arterial line was also re-sited to his right radial artery
for the same reason.

The rest of this hospital course and discharge status,
medications, and diagnoses will be addended by the next
intern coming on service.

abuse.  Denies tobacco use.

PHYSICAL EXAM AT TIME OF ADMISSION:  Vital signs -
temperature 97.4, heart rate 55, blood pressure 129/77,
respiratory rate 24, O2 sat 99% on room air.  General -
pleasant man, sitting upright, speaking in full sentences, in
no acute distress.  Skin - no jaundice or rashes.  HEENT -
anicteric, noninjected.  Pupils equally round and reactive to
light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Mucous membranes
moist.  OP clear.  Neck - JVD at angle of jaw, no bruits. no
lymphadenopathy.  Heart - irregularly irregular, III/VI
holosystolic murmur throughout.  Respiratory - a few
vesicular breath sound at bases, otherwise clear.  Abdomen
was distended, nontender, soft, with shifting dullness to
percussion, but no fluid wave transmission, no
hepatosplenomegaly, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities - 3+
pitting edema bilaterally up to the knees.  Neuro - cranial
nerves II through XII grossly intact, no focal deficits.

LAB DATA:  White count 6.4, hematocrit 34.9, platelets 160,
PT 18.5, PTT 39.8, INR 2.3, sodium 138, potassium 4.3,
chloride 100, CO2 28, BUN 25, creatinine 1.3, ALT 16, AST 68,

afib., paced irregularly with a rate of 63, with axis of
-68??????, [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in V3, and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in V2
through 4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was treated by the medical
service with consultation from heart failure service, as well
as cardiology.  The cardiac surgery service was consulted as
well.

The patient was diuresed over the first 10 days of his
hospitalization.  Following that period of time, the patient
was evaluated for heart transplant, as it was felt that he
may require an LVAT during his mitral valve replacement.

On the [**6-25**], the patient was brought to the cardiac
catheterization lab where an intra-aortic balloon pump was
placed prior to his being transferred to the operating room
for a redo mitral valve replacement.  Please see the
catheterization lab report for full details.  In summary, he
had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed prior to surgery.  He
was then brought directly to the surgical suite, at which
time he underwent redo mitral valve replacement with a #27
mosaic porcine valve via a right thoracotomy.  The patient
tolerated the operation and was transferred from the
operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
Please see the OR report for full details and summary.

The patient was transferred, after redo MVR, with a mean
arterial pressure of 82.  He was V-paced at a rate of 80.
His IV medications included amiodarone at 2 mg/min,
epinephrine at 0.03 mcg/kg/min, milrinone at 0.5 mcg/kg/min,
Levophed at 0.15 mcg/kg/min, and propofol at 10 mcg/kg/min.
In the immediate postoperative period, the electrophysiology
service was consulted regarding ventricular ectopy.  At that
time, his internal pacer was increased to a rate of 90 in an
attempt to control his ventricular ectopy.  The patient did
well in the immediate postoperative period.

During the first 24 hours, epinephrine was weaned to off, and
his amiodarone was decreased to 1 mg/min.  On the morning of
postoperative day #1, the intra-aortic balloon pump was
weaned and ultimately discontinued.  During that period, the
patient remained hemodynamically stable.  Neurologically, the
patient's sedation was weaned to a point that he was able to
move all four extremities and nod appropriately following a
quick neuro assessment.  The patient was resedated therefore
requiring continued ventilatory support.  Following removal
of the intra-aortic balloon pump, the patient's Levophed was
weaned to off, and on postoperative day #2, the propofol was
discontinued, thereby allowing us to wean the patient from
the ventilator.  The patient was successfully extubated on
postoperative day #2.

Over the next several days, the patient was slowly weaned
from his milrinone infusion.  On postoperative day #5, the
milrinone was successfully discontinued.  Following the
successful discontinuation of the IV milrinone infusion, the
patient was transferred to Far-2 for continued postoperative
care and cardiac rehabilitation.  The patient remained on
Far-2 for an additional three days, during which time his
activity level was increased with the assistance of the
physical therapist and the nursing staff.  On postoperative
day #10, it was decided that the patient was stable and ready
to be discharged to home with the assistance of visiting
nurses.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM:  Vital signs - temperature 98, heart
rate 70, V-paced, blood pressure 100/52, respiratory rate 20,
O2 sat 95% on room air, weight preoperatively 102 kg, and at
discharge 97.3 kg.  Alert and oriented x 3.  Moves all

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old
female with a known history of coronary artery disease,
status post a myocardial infarction twelve years ago, who
presented to the Emergency Department with chest pain.

The patient reported that her chest pain developed last
evening when she was at rest.  She took three sublingual
nitroglycerin tablets with subsequent resolution of her chest
pain; however, her chest pain returned later in the evening,
and she presented to the Emergency Department.

Upon presentation to [**Hospital6 33**] Emergency
Department, the patient was given sublingual nitroglycerin as
well as Lovenox 60 mg at 9 p.m., aspirin, and morphine.

The patient subsequently had recurrence of her chest pain at
approximately 2 a.m. and was noted to have ST depressions in
V4 through V6, II, III, and aVF.  Her initial laboratories
were borderline positive with a troponin of 0.16, creatine
kinase of 159, and MB positive at 32.  Therefore, she was
transferred from [**Hospital6 33**] to the [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Department.

In the Emergency Department, a Cardiology consultation was
obtained, and the patient was complaining of [**4-16**] chest pain
which resolved with administration of morphine.  The patient
was noted to have a borderline blood pressure of
approximately 90 systolic and was treated with 500 cc of
normal saline bolus.  A 2B3A inhibitor was not given because
the patient had a hematocrit of 28 and was noted to be
guaiac-positive on physical examination.  The patient also
reported bright red blood per rectum, presumed to be her
hemorrhoids, for approximately one week prior to admission.

A repeat electrocardiogram obtained upon arrival showed some
improvement in her ST depressions.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems was positive for
longstanding lightheadedness which is worse in the morning
and relieved by lying down.  The patient denied any current
shortness of [**Last Name (LF) 1440**], [**First Name3 (LF) 691**] radiation of her chest pain, or any
associated nausea or vomiting.  The patient reported never
having chest pain similar to this prior to this episode.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction twelve years ago.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Diabetes.
4.  History of transient ischemic attack four years ago with
binocular blindness.
5.  Status post cholecystectomy.
6.  History of large subdural hematoma ten years ago, status
post drainage at Nimmock.
7.  Bright red blood per rectum since [**2197-1-7**].

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies, but
reports that ASPIRIN upsets her stomach.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aggrenox (dipyridamole 200 and 25)
1 tablet p.o. q.d., insulin 24 units subcutaneous q.d.,
Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d., isosorbide 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.,
irbesartan 150/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 1 tablet p.o. q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denied any tobacco or alcohol
use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed
afebrile, blood pressure of 95/50, pulse of 80, satting 99%
on 4 liters nasal cannula.  In general, comfortable, in no
acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed
mildly dry mucous membranes.  Jugular venous distention at
11 cm.  Cardiovascular revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs revealed occasional
wheezes bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities revealed no
edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses.
Rectal revealed guaiac-positive brown stool.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory values
revealed a white blood cell count of 12.8, hematocrit
of 26.3, platelets of 302.  Sodium of 142, potassium of 3.9,
chloride of 108, bicarbonate of 24, blood urea nitrogen
of 21, creatinine of 1.1, glucose of 155.  PTT of 36.3, PT
of 17.4, INR of 1.2.  Creatine kinase of 281, MB of 59, with
an index of 21.  Calcium of 7.8, magnesium of 1.6,
phosphorous of 2.7.  Albumin of 2.9.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus
rhythm at 89 beats per minute, Q waves in V1 through V3, 1-mm
ST elevations in V4 through V6, ST depressions in I, II, and
aVR, and aVL.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 84-year-old female with
known coronary artery disease who presented with unstable
angina who is now chest pain free status post nitroglycerin
drip and heparin with no subsequent administration of a 2B3A
inhibitor given her recent bright red blood per rectum and
hematocrit of 26.

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was continued on her
nitroglycerin drip as well as heparin drip and started on a
low-dose beta blocker.  Her aspirin was continued; however,
her Aggrenox was discontinued, and the patient was treated
with 1 unit of packed red blood cells given her low
hematocrit.  Her blood pressure was monitored closely;
however, the patient did not require any further boluses to
maintain her blood pressure.

The patient was sent to catheterization later in the day
which revealed 3-vessel disease with total occasional of the
left circumflex, 90% left anterior descending artery which
was stented, 80% middle right coronary artery which was
stented and which was felt to be the culprit lesion.  Her
pulmonary artery saturation was noted to be 40%, with a wedge
of 36.  Therefore, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.
The patient was diuresed with 60 mg of Lasix in the
catheterization laboratory and sent to the Coronary Care
Unit.

Upon arrival in the Coronary Care Unit, the patient was
stable without any complaints of further chest pain.

Therefore, the patient was felt to have suffered a non-Q-wave
myocardial infarction secondary to a right coronary artery
culprit lesion and was noted on catheterization to have
severe 3-vessel disease, however, was not felt to be a
surgical candidate.  Therefore, the patient was continued on
aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor.  A 2B3A inhibitor continued to
be held given her history of bright red blood per rectum.  A
beta blocker was held until the intra-aortic balloon pump was
removed.  However, the patient was started right away on a
low-dose ACE inhibitor which was titrated up as tolerated.

On the day following her catheterization, the intra-aortic
balloon pump was weaned, and the patient tolerated this
without difficulty.  It was subsequently removed on
[**3-31**], and the heparin drip was discontinued.  The
patient was maintained on telemetry over the remainder of her
hospital stay and had no arrhythmic events.  Her Swan-Ganz
catheter was discontinued once the patient was felt to have
effectively diuresed, and Lopressor and captopril were
started back and titrated up as tolerated.

A transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained which
demonstrated a mildly dilated left atrium, with a normal left
ventricular wall and cavity size, but with hypokinesis of the
anterior and anteroseptal walls of the left ventricle, and
overall moderately depressed ventricular systolic function.
The right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion were
noted to be normal.  The patient demonstrated 2+ mitral
regurgitation and borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension without any evidence of pericardial effusion.

At the time of discharge, the patient was tolerating
administration of Zestril and atenolol with adequate blood
pressure response.  She was referred to follow up with her
cardiologist associated with her primary care physician at
the [**Hospital6 33**].

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was noted to have a
positive urinalysis and mild fever at the time of admission.
A urine culture was obtained, and the patient was started on
ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.   The patient did not
demonstrate any symptoms of a urinary tract infection during
her hospital stay.  She completed a 5-day course of
ciprofloxacin for treatment of her urinary tract infection,
and subsequently remained afebrile, and her white blood cell
count normalized.  She had no further Infectious Disease
issues throughout the remainder her hospital stay.

3.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was noted to have a low
hematocrit and bright red blood per rectum at the time of
admission.  She was treated with one unit of packed red blood
cells in the Emergency Department prior to catheterization.
On the day following her catheterization, the patient was
once again given a single unit of packed red blood cells, and
subsequently her hematocrit remained stable.  She was
recommended to follow up with her primary care physician to
arrange for an outpatient colonoscopy.  Otherwise, the
patient's hematocrit remained stable, and she remained
hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of her
hospital stay.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was maintained on a
regular diet which she tolerated without difficulty.  She
complained of constipation and was started on Dulcolax
suppository with good effect.

5.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient had a history of diabetes
mellitus and was placed on a regular insulin sliding-scale
during her hospitalization.  Once the patient was able to eat
a regular diet she was switched back to daily insulin
injections at her prior dose of 24 units per day.  She was
encouraged to follow up with her primary care physician soon
after discharge to check her sugar control.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was evaluated by
Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy, who determined
that the patient was safe to go home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE/STATUS:  Therefore, she was discharged
to home on [**4-3**] in stable condition.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   She was to follow up with her primary
care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1726**] (telephone number
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 36012**]) who will refer her to a local cardiologist for
further followup.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 37-year-old male with
cardiac risk factors of mild hypercholesterolemia who had his
first myocardial infarction on [**8-27**] of this year of the
left anterior descending artery (proximally).

The patient had been doing well after discharge.  He had been
discharged on Plavix, aspirin, and Coumadin.  On the day of
admission, he had been exercising on his bike for 20 minutes
when 20 minutes after exercise he experienced chest pressure,
some shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.  He immediately
recognized the symptoms and went by ambulance to [**Hospital6 3426**] where electrocardiogram showed an anterior ST
elevation myocardial infarction with elevation in V1 through
V6.  The patient received nitroglycerin, morphine, aspirin,
and heparin and was transferred within one hour to [**Hospital1 1444**] for cardiac catheterization.

Catheterization showed a total occlusion of the left anterior
descending artery at the area of the stent placement.  A
balloon angioplasty was performed at the site without
complications, and the patient was sent to the Coronary Care
Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (The patient's past medical history
was significant for)
1.  Mild hypercholesterolemia; treated with Zocor.
2.  The patient also had an echocardiogram on [**2117-8-31**]
which showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 30% and
anteroseptal, anterior, and apical kinesis.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  The patient's home medications
were enalapril 10 mg p.o. once per day, Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
twice per day, Zocor 20 mg p.o. once per day, Coumadin 5 mg
p.o. once per day, aspirin 81 mg p.o. once per day, folic
acid 3 mg p.o. once per day, and Plavix.

ALLERGIES:  There were no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Social history was significant for no
tobacco use.  No intravenous drug use.  Occasional alcohol.
The patient had been following a regular exercise course.  He
is a business manager at [**Hospital1 **].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was significant for no early
cardiovascular disease.  Two brother are healthy.  One sister
with diabetes mellitus.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed vital signs with temperature of 98.3, heart rate
was 81, blood pressure was 105/71, respiratory rate was 20.
In general, the patient was awake and alert, in no acute
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Extraocular muscles were intact.  No increased jugular venous
pressure.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate
and rhythm with no murmurs and a fourth heart sound.  The
abdomen was soft and benign.  Lungs were clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  Extremities revealed the patient
had a femoral sheath in the right groin with no hematoma and
2+ palpable dorsalis pedis pulses.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
showed white blood cell count was 15,000, hematocrit
was 35.9, platelets were 207.  INR was 3.3, PTT was greater
than 150.  Creatine kinase was 137, and potassium was
measured at 3.5.  Arterial blood gas showed pH of 7.25, PCO2
was 45, and PO2 was 180, with a bicarbonate of 21.  The
latest total cholesterol tests from [**2117-8-26**] showed a
total cholesterol of 174, and high-density lipoprotein
was 42, low-density lipoprotein was 108, triglycerides
were 119.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram measured at [**Hospital6 3426**] showed sinus rhythm with a rate of 81, 3-mm ST
elevations in I, aVL, and V2 through V6; 2-mm ST depressions
in II, III, and aVF.

Electrocardiogram taken after cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 1444**] showed sinus rhythm at a rate
of 89, P-R prolongation, decreased ST elevations in V2
through V6, and resolved abnormalities in II, III, and aVF.

A chest x-ray showed no pulmonary edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient did well.  The patient was
started on Plavix, Integrilin, Zocor, aspirin, beta blocker,
and ACE inhibitors.

Serial creatine phosphokinases and troponin I were done with
a peak creatine phosphokinase of 1112 and a peak troponin of
greater than 50.

The patient was taken back for catheterization and evaluation
for brachy therapy.  The catheterization revealed no
significant hyperplasia within the stent; and therefore
brachy therapy was not performed.  A repeat echocardiogram on
[**2117-10-25**] showed an ejection fraction of 30%,
hypokinesis of the anterior free wall and septum, and
dyskinesis of the apex.  A left ventricular mass or thrombus
could not be excluded.

Due to this patient's unusual situation of in-stent
thrombosis while on Coumadin, aspirin, and Plavix,
hypercoagulability studies were pursued.  A lupus
anticoagulant test was performed and was found to be
negative.

The right femoral catheter was removed on [**2117-10-27**].
This procedure was significant for the fact that 70 minutes
of pressure had to be held at the site before bleeding
stopped.  In addition, the patient had a vagal episode with a
heart rate down to the 50s and systolic blood pressure down
to the 80s.  He was given 0.5 mg of atropine and a 500-cc
bolus of normal saline with improvement.

On [**10-29**], the patient was exercising increasing pain in
the right groin area where the catheter had been removed.
The patient was given pain medications, and a CAT scan showed
a hematoma without retroperitoneal bleed, and the patient was
instructed to limit his movement to and from the bathroom.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Zestril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Folic acid 3 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient's condition on discharge
was good.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed to follow up
with his cardiologist.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:   In-stent re-thrombosis with resulting
ST elevation anterior wall myocardial infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 37-year-old man
with mild hypercholesterolemia, currently being treated only
with exercise who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2117-8-27**]
complaining of crushing substernal chest pain that radiated
to the left arm.  The patient had been running that day and
after one quarter mile of his normal six mile run, he was
forced to stop, as the symptoms developed.  Specifically, he
had chest pain and felt a little lightheaded.  He denies
nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis at that time or dizziness at
that time.  He was then able to flag down another runner who
was able to contact the Emergency Medical Services and have
him brought to the hospital.  At [**Hospital3 **], an
electrocardiogram was obtained and the findings were as
follows:  ST segment elevations in the lateral limb leads,
one in AVL and lateral anterior leads V2 through V5.  He
received oxygen, intravenous nitroglycerin, beta blocker,
Lopressor 5 mg x1, Lipitor and a heparin drip.  He was then
transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**] for
emergency cardiac catheterization.

The patient reports having had a similar episode of chest
tightness that had resolved after running five days before
presentation.  He had been in his normal state of health
before then.  At cardiac catheterization, a total occlusion
of the proximal left anterior descending artery was found.
The patient underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty and a stent was placed.  An intra-aortic balloon
pump was also placed because the patient's wedge pressure was
26 mmHg and he then he was transferred to the Coronary Care
Unit.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.0??????, heart rate 75, blood
pressure 113/83, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 98%

to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Normoactive bowel sounds.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended.  There were no masses appreciated.
EXTREMITIES:  There was no clubbing.  There was no cyanosis.
There was no edema.

Left groin intra-aortic balloon pump catheter was in place.
He had right venous and arterial sheaths in place.

LABORATORY EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell
count 15.5, hematocrit 36.2, platelet count 214, INR 2.0.
Electrolytes:  Sodium 143, potassium 4.1, chloride 111,
bicarbonate 19, blood, urea and nitrogen 16, creatinine 0.9,
glucose 121.  Cardiac enzymes as follows:  On [**2117-8-28**], the
creatine phosphokinase was 5177. On [**2117-8-28**], it was 7255.On
[**2117-8-29**], the creatinine was phosphokinase was 4273.  On
[**2117-8-30**], it was 1553.  The MB isozyme creatine phosphokinase
was as follows:  On [**2117-8-28**] it was 246.  On [**2117-8-29**] it was
147.  On [**8-29**] in the evening it was 86.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care unit where he received aspirin, Plavix, Integrilin,
heparin drip following removal of the sheath, metoprolol and
Lipitor.  In the Coronary Care Unit, the patient remained
chest pain free, had good urine output an the intra-aortic
balloon pump was removed on [**2117-8-29**].  The patient was
transferred to C-Med on [**2117-8-30**].  Examination at that time
was essentially unchanged, except there was no femoral
hematoma bilaterally and the distal pulses were 2+
bilaterally.  There was no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
There was no calf tenderness.

The patient had a low grade temperature T-max of 100.4?????? after
being transferred to the C-Med service.  He had a urinalysis
which was negative.  Chest x-ray was negative and blood
cultures which did not grow anything.  The fever subsided by
the afternoon of [**2117-8-31**].  Again, the patient was chest pain
free during the entire stay.  The patient was evaluated on
[**2117-9-1**] by the physical therapy service.  Their findings
were that all goals were achieved and that further inpatient

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old Caucasian
female with a past medical history significant for
hypertension and atrial fibrillation.  She presented with
anterior myocardial infarction to the CCU status post
catheterization. The patient states that Saturday morning
while preparing some breakfast, she began to have substernal
pain described as crushing sensation.  She states that she
has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and that she
took TUMS.  The pain was not relieved.  EMS was called and
the patient was brought to the Emergency Department.  In the
Emergency Department, the patient was given Nitroglycerin,
Lopressor 5 mg q5 times three.  She had diffuse ST elevations
in leads V2 through V3.  At that time, she was admitted to
the C-Medicine and nothing was done due to the resolution of
ST changes. On [**2198-8-26**], the patient began to have chest pain
once again described as substernal and crushing.  CK showed
713, up from 52, the first laboratory value.  A
catheterization was done and showed mild disease in left main
coronary artery and moderate proximal disease in left
anterior descending with total occlusion after D2 with faint
left to left collaterals.  There were elevated right and left
heart filling pressures with moderate pulmonary hypertension
with a markedly depressed cardiac output.  At that time, the
patient was given intravenous Milrinone for the decreased
cardiac output.  A stent was deployed in occluded left
anterior descending.  The patient arrived at the CCU at
approximately 3:00 p.m.  Upon arrival, the patient was found
to be alert, with no apparent distress.  She did not complain
of shortness of breath.  She did, however, complain of
palpitations.  At that time, a chest x-ray was ordered and it
showed worsening congestive heart failure marked by
cephalization and pleural effusion.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 12.4, hemoglobin
9.0, hematocrit 30.1, platelet count 39,900, MCV 76.0. CK
666, CK MB 76, troponin 2.19.  This was up from 1.95 with
earlier laboratory study.  Sodium 133, potassium 3.1,
chloride 93, bicarbonate 32, blood urea nitrogen 23,
creatinine 0.6, glucose 156.  Liver enzymes were as follows:
ALT 17, AST 52, alkaline phosphatase 61, total bilirubin 2.0,
calcium 9.7, phosphorus 3.0, magnesium 2.2.  Urinalysis was
done and it was negative.

Chest x-ray showed fluffy infiltrates, right pleural
effusion, cardiomegaly.

Catheterization results were as follows:  Left main coronary
artery showed mild disease.  Left anterior descending showed
moderate proximal disease, total occlusion after D2 with
faint left to left collaterals.  D2 has 50% stenosis.  Left
circumflex showed moderate diffuse disease.  Right coronary
artery nondominant.  Right atrial pressure is mean 15, aortic
pressure 132/82, pulmonary artery 50/25, right ventricular
pressure 50.

Electrocardiogram showed ST elevations in anterior leads, V2
and V3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Rales on lung examination and pleural
infiltrates on chest x-ray.  She also showed jugular venous
distention of about seven centimeters on the right atrium.
We also continued the Integrilin that she was started on in
the catheterization laboratory and continued Aspirin and
Nitroglycerin drip.  Metoprolol was discontinued because of
decreased cardiac index.  The patient was continued on
Milrinone for decreased cardiac output until 8:00 a.m.  She
was then started on Digoxin because of history of atrial
fibrillation and decreased cardiac output.

She was given one unit of blood secondary to hemoglobin of
9.0.  Valsartan was discontinued and the patient was started
on Captopril 12.5 mg three times a day for post myocardial
infarction protocol.  The patient received 80 mg potassium
secondary to laboratory value of 3.1.  She was diuresed once
more with 20 mg of Lasix.  She responded well putting out
approximately two liters.

She was found to be confused overnight and was started on
Seroquel.  The next morning she was found to be awake, alert
and oriented times three.  Digoxin was discontinued and
Amiodarone was increased to 200 mg p.o. three times a day for
rate control.  This was secondary to a heart rate in the one
teens.  Beta blocker was increased to 12.5 mg and Captopril
was increased to 50 mg p.o. three times a day.

On [**2198-8-28**], the patient was found to have a nosebleed after
sitting up and using the bathroom.  It was believed that this
was due to a vasovagal response.  The patient responded well
to pressure.  No other events of bleeding during her stay.

Oxygen was turned off and Heparin was stopped for one hour
and then restarted.  The patient was given Coumadin at 6:00
p.m. secondary to being high risk of thrombus formation,
anterior myocardial infarction and also a history of atrial
fibrillation.

A transthoracic echocardiogram was done and it showed left
atrium moderate dilatation.  It also showed moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal akinesis.
She had an ejection fraction of 30 to 35%.  Also found was 1%
aortic regurgitation and 1+ mitral regurgitation.  On
[**2198-8-29**], the patient was taken for transesophageal
echocardiogram guided cardioversion secondary to conversion
of atrial fibrillation into atrial flutter.  The patient
tolerated conversion well, was given 200 joules and is now in
sinus rhythm.

The patient was found to be acceptable to go to
rehabilitation tomorrow by physical therapy consultation.
The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her primary
care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2198-9-12**], at 10:30 a.m.  Directions are
given in page one that will accompany discharge summary. The
patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**], her cardiologist, on
[**2198-9-10**], [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Seven at 1:30 p.m.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 51 year old male
patient who noticed to have chest pressure a few hours prior
to admission.  He presented to an outside hospital Emergency
Department about 3:00 in the afternoon and was found to have
elevated ST segments.  He was started on Integrilin at that
time and was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for emergency cardiac catheterization.  This revealed
left main and severe three vessel coronary artery disease
with a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55
percent and was referred for emergency coronary artery bypass
grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for nephrolithiasis status
post stone extraction as well as ankle surgery.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:  Accupril, Metoprolol 100 mg po
bid, Lipitor 20 mg po q d, Vitamin E, and Aspirin daily.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states no known drug allergies
although he does note an upset stomach with erythromycin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission to the hospital was
unremarkable as were his laboratory values with the exception
of elevated CPKs and Troponins.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken emergently to the
Operating Room due to his findings in catheterization
laboratory of a 95 percent left main coronary artery
stenosis, as well as a 90 percent to 95 percent left anterior
descending coronary artery lesion.  80 percent proximal left
circumflex and an occluded right coronary artery.  The
patient was taken to the Operating Room with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft
times three.  The patient had an intraaortic balloon pump
placed preoperatively due to his anatomy.  Postoperatively he
was transported from the Operating Room to Cardiac Surgery
Recovery Unit in good condition on Propofol and Phenylephrine
drips.

On postoperative day #1, he was weaned from mechanical
ventilation, successfully extubated.  He remains on Neo-
Synephrine for the next day or so due to some hypotension,
his cardiac function remained good with a cardiac index of
greater than 3.  His intraaortic balloon pump was weaned and
subsequently discontinued on postoperative day #1.  The
patient did require some intravenous fluid boluses for
hypotension.

On postoperative day #2, the patient had some atrial
fibrillation and was placed on Amiodarone because of this.
He was also begun on Lopressor at that time and begun with
diuresis.

The following day the patient had converted back to normal
sinus rhythm.  Had remained hemodynamically stable.  Had his
Neo-Synephrine drip weaned to off and was tolerating beta
blocker and diuresis.

Postoperative day #3, he was transferred from the intensive
care unit to the telemetry floor.  His Metoprolol had been
increased.  His [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain in his leg had been
removed and he had begun ambulation and cardiac
rehabilitation.  The patient subsequently on the telemetry
floor had another episode of atrial fibrillation that was
short lived on [**2164-7-10**], early in the morning that was
self limiting.  His Lopressor was increased and he has not
had any further episodes of atrial fibrillation.  He remains
on Amiodarone and Metoprolol for this.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, [**2164-7-11**], is as follows:
The patient is afebrile.  He is in normal sinus rhythm with a
rate in the mid 70's.  His blood pressure is 120/74.  Room
air oxygen saturation is 96 percent.  Neurologically he is
grossly intact with no apparent deficits.  His pulmonary
examination - his lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Coronary examination is regular rate and
rhythm.  His abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  His
extremities are warm without edema.  His sternal incision as
well as his right leg incisions are all clean and dry with no
erythema, no drainage.  The Steri-strips are intact.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 100 mg po bid, Lasix 20 mg
po bid times seven days, Potassium Chloride 20 mEq po bid
times seven days, Zantac 150 mg po bid, Aspirin 325 mg po q
d, Plavix 75 mg po q d times three months.  Lipitor 20 mg po
q d, Percocet 5/325 po q four hours prn pain.  The patient is
also to continue on Amiodarone 400 mg po tid times one week,
then decrease to 400 mg po bid times one week, then decrease
400 mg po q d times one week, and then decrease to 200 mg po
q d for the remaining week.  This is the tentative plan for
Amiodarone loading unless it is altered or until it is
discontinued by the patient's primary cardiologist, Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  The patient is also going home with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of
Hearts cardiac monitor for his Amiodarone loading and this
will be transmitted to the electrophysiology service here at
[**Hospital1 69**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

The patient is to follow up with is  primary care physician,
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 5661**] in one to two weeks.  He is to follow up with his
primary cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] also in one to two
weeks and to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] in
approximately five to six weeks.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease status post emergent coronary
   artery bypass graft.
2. Postoperative  atrial fibrillation.

Service:  MICU ROM

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 68-year-old
gentleman with a past medical history significant for severe
COPD, AFib, anxiety and depression, who was transferred from
[**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**2167-2-22**] to [**Hospital1 190**] for further evaluation of his COPD.
Specifically, the patient was admitted to the CT Surgery
service for evaluation for potential lung volume reduction
surgery.

The patient's primary pulmonologist at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital is
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 55254**] and he referred the patient specifically to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 952**], a CT Surgery attending at [**Hospital3 **].  The [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course from [**2167-2-22**] up until [**2167-3-6**] has been
dictated previously by a CT surgeon on Dr.[**Name (NI) 1816**] team.  To
briefly summarize their report, the patient was transferred
on [**2167-2-22**] with issues including failure to thrive, COPD,
cachexia with severe malnutrition, and a small/medium vessel
vasculitis resulting in multiple skin erosions on all four of
the patient's extremities.

While on the CT Surgery service, the patient was evaluated by
multiple services, including Dermatology, Plastic Surgery,
Vascular Surgery, Infectious Disease, Rheumatology,
Pulmonary, Nutrition, and Physical Therapy.  The Pulmonary
service recommended inhaled steroids as well as
around-the-clock MDIs including Atrovent and albuterol for
his pulmonary disease.  He had pulmonary function testing on
[**2-25**] that revealed a SVC of 2.98, which is 70% of
predicted, a FEV1 of 0.96, which is 33% predicted, and a
FEV1:FVC ratio of 32, which is 47% predicted.  This is
consistent with very severe COPD.

The patient had a CT of the chest with and without contrast
on [**2167-2-24**] that showed no lymphadenopathy, extensive
emphysematous changes bilaterally, and multiple small
bilateral vague patchy areas of nodularity of uncertain
significance.  There were no pleural or pericardial
effusions, no infiltrates.  An incidental finding was made of
an infrarenal aortic stenosis and extensive vascular
calcifications.  Because of this incidental finding, the
patient had bilateral PVR testing that revealed significantly
decreased flow to the right leg and a normal PVR of the left
leg.  The patient subsequently had bilateral lower extremity
angiograms on [**2167-2-27**], which revealed near total occlusion
of the right common iliac artery and therefore, the patient
underwent two stents by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] being placed in that
artery.

As far as further significant events during his CT Surgery
hospital course, the patient was evaluated by Dermatology and
had multiple biopsies of the skin ulcerations.  He was
diagnosed with a medium vessel vasculitis thought to be
secondary to medications.  The most likely culprit is
amoxicillin, which the patient had been taking for a COPD
flare prior to his hospitalization at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.
There was no evidence of a systemic vasculitis or
rheumatologic issue based on multiple testing including
negative [**Doctor First Name **], negative rheumatoid factor, negative ANCA, and
negative RPR.

Of note, Infectious Disease was also consulted as mentioned
above at the outside hospital.  These ulcers secondary to
vasculitis on the patient's extremities grew out both MRSA
and Enterococcus, therefore the patient was placed on
linezolid and ciprofloxacin to cover these organisms.  The
reason antibiotics were started was that the patient had a
leukocytosis with a peak white blood cell count of 28,000
while on the CT Surgery service team.  Also from an ID
perspective, the patient was treated empirically for
Clostridium difficile infection because of profuse diarrhea,
which improved with Flagyl.

This describes the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course on the CT
Surgery service as noted in a previous dictation.  It was
felt that because of the patient's multiple comorbidities
including malnutrition and this vasculitis, he was not
currently a candidate for lung volume reduction surgery.

The patient was transferred to the MICU Green Team Resident
Only Service on [**2167-3-9**] for hypercapnic respiratory failure.
 For 24 hours prior to transfer, the patient had been having
difficulty breathing and was somnolent on the floor.  Serial
ABGs showed a worsening hypercapnia.  His ABG on the evening
of [**2167-3-8**] was 7.3, 60, and 80.

The next morning the patient was still having difficulty.
Was noted to be somnolent, and his ABG was 7.21 pH, 80 pCO2,
and 80 O2.  Therefore, the MICU team was called.  The patient
on examination was noted to have diffuse expiratory wheezes
and was found to be in hypercapnic respiratory failure.  He
was transferred immediately to the MICU.  A trial of BiPAP
was initiated as the patient had responded to this in the
past.  An A-line was placed in the patient's right arm
immediately.  After 15 minutes on BiPAP, repeat ABG was pH
7.19, pCO2 87, and pO2 had dropped to 52.  Therefore,
Anesthesia was called for an elective intubation.  The
patient was sedated with Fentanyl, Versed, was intubated and
placed on assist control 550/16 100 FIO2.  Repeat blood gas
immediately after intubation was 7.23, pCO2 of 70, and pO2 of
367.  The vent was therefore changed to AC at 50% FIO2, 550
tidal volume by 20% respiratory rate with a repeat ABG of pH
7.32, pCO2 of 55, and pO2 of 101.

Of note, immediately after intubation, the patient was noted
to become hypotensive with mean arterial pressures between 40
and 50 and required the use of Levophed as a pressor.  A
chest x-ray was obtained post intubation that showed no
evidence of infiltrate, no new pneumothoraces, and no obvious
explanation for why the patient had a hypercapnic respiratory
failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. COPD:  Patient has had heavy tobacco use for 30 plus
years.  Of note the patient had recently been hospitalized in
[**Month (only) 404**] for a pneumonia and a COPD flare requiring BiPAP use.
Prior to this hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**], however, the patient
had never required intubation.  A month prior to admission,
the patient had been on p.o. prednisone for COPD flare.
Baseline sats were 93% per outside hospital records.  Patient
was not on home O2.
2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, not anticoagulated.
3. MRSA wound infections in the lower extremities, also
Enterococcus, and gram-negative rods in the wound
infection/vasculitis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives on [**Hospital3 **].  He lives by
himself.  He is a retired Air Force pilot.  He was a prior
competitive swimmer.  He is separated from his wife since
[**2163**].  [**Name2 (NI) **] has two children, who are very involved in his
care, a son who lives on [**Location (un) **], and a daughter, who lives
in [**Name (NI) 51454**].

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM THE CT SURGERY SERVICE:
1. Protonix 40 IV q.d.
2. Thiamine 50 p.o. q.d.
3. Lovenox 40 subq q.d.
4. Toradol 15 IV q.6h. prn.
5. Vancomycin 500 mg IV q.d.
6. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7. Doxycycline 100 mg IV q.d.
8. Solu-Medrol 30 mg q.8h.
9. Albuterol prn.

ALLERGIES:  Procaine, novocaine, [**Female First Name (un) **] anesthetics, and
penicillin.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION TO THE MICU:  The patient was
afebrile.  Blood pressure was quite labile ranging from
systolic blood pressure of 60-190/diagnostic of 40-100, pulse
was 70-120 and was regular.  In general, the patient prior to
intubation appeared very labored from a breathing
perspective.  He was quite somnolent and only responded to
questions with a lot of prompting and shaking.  Patient is
very cachectic.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular muscles are
intact.  Oropharynx is clear.  Heart:  S1, S2, regular, no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Lungs:  Diffuse expiratory
wheezes bilaterally, no crackles.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Multiple ulcers in the legs and arms and some
areas of modeling in the legs.  Neurologically:  The patient
was responsive to commands, but otherwise quite somnolent and
was subsequently intubated.

DATA ON ADMISSION:  Hematocrit was 31.6, white count was 17.5
with 96% neutrophils and 0 bands.  INR is 0.8.  PTT 28, PT
11.  Platelet count was 413.  Chemistries:  Sodium 140,
potassium 5, chloride 103, bicarb 28, BUN 43, creatinine 0.5,
glucose 127, calcium 8.9, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus 4.9.
Urine electrolytes were significant for a FENa of 0.1%.
Clostridium difficile was negative x2.  Blood cultures from
admission and [**2167-2-28**] showed no growth to date.

EKG was normal sinus rhythm, rate 100, normal axis, prominent
P waves.  Old Q waves in the inferior leads and slightly
early R-wave progression.  These EKG changes were old.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with
severe COPD initially admitted to the CT Surgery service on
[**2167-2-22**] for evaluation for potential lung volume reduction
surgery.  As the patient had multiple other comorbidities as
noted including a medium vessel vasculitis thought to be
secondary to medication, extreme cachexia from his COPD and
malnutrition, and likely Clostridium difficile colitis, the
surgery was deferred.  The patient had an episode of
hypercapnic respiratory failure and therefore was transferred
to the MICU for further care and was intubated.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Respiratory failure:  On initial admission, it was unclear
as to the etiology of the patient's hypercapnic respiratory
failure.  Initial chest x-ray on admission showed no evidence
of pulmonary infiltrates, and no evidence of pneumothoraces.
Status post intubation, the patient became more and more
hypotensive and pressor dependent.  While a central line was
being placed in the right internal jugular vein, the patient
became severely bradycardic and eventually asystolic.  A
cardiac arrest code was called, and the patient went from
asystole to a PEA arrest requiring Epinephrine and atropine
dosing.  The patient then entered a ventricular fibrillation
and was shocked multiple times.  The patient then returned to
[**Location 213**] sinus rhythm in the 80s with a blood pressure that
rose using multiple pressors.

In this setting, a repeat chest x-ray was obtained.  This
showed a very large right-sided tension pneumothorax.  A
needle decompression was performed and a chest tube was
immediately placed by the Surgery service.

Based on the above description, it was felt that the
patient's hypotension post BiPAP and intubation likely
reflected the beginnings of a pneumothorax and that with
subsequent PEEP as well as auto PEEP, this developed into a
tension pneumothorax leading to a PEA arrest.  Although this
occurred in the setting of a right IJ placement, it was not
felt that the pneumothorax was due to the right IJ being
placed, although this is a possibility.  As the patient
became hypotensive immediately after intubation, however, it
is most likely that the patient had an apical bleb then
ruptured with intubation.

The patient's pneumothorax resolved with needle decompression
and placement of a chest tube.  He was intubated and weaned
until [**2167-3-12**] at which time the patient was extubated.
However, over the next 24 hours, the patient began more and
more hypercapnic and required reintubation on [**2167-3-13**].  The
right apical pneumothorax was stable and this decompensation
was felt to be due to extremely severe COPD.

As the patient was becoming difficult to wean, it was decided
that it would be in the patient's best interest to have a
tracheostomy placed for further weaning and for patient's
safety.  Therefore, a tracheostomy was placed on Tuesday,
[**2167-3-17**].  At the same time, a PEG was also placed.  These
are both done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with the patient's consent and
the family were also very involved in the decision and agreed
with these procedures.

The patient tolerated the tracheostomy without complications.
He was able to be weaned to CPAP with pressure support and on
the day of discharge to the pulmonary rehab facility, he was
requiring 0 PEEP and a pressure support of 8 with excellent
oxygenation and no signs of hypercapnia.

The patient was continued on intravenous Solu-Medrol that was
eventually tapered.  The day of discharge he was to be
discharged to prednisone 12.5 mg p.o. q.d. as this correlated
to his Solu-Medrol dose of 10 IV q.d.  It was decided to
change to p.o. as the patient no longer had any IV access as
these were all removed to prevent line-related infection, and
as the patient was clinically was much more stable.  The
patient was continued on albuterol and Atrovent MDIs as well.
Chest x-ray prior to admission showed no pneumothorax, no
infiltrates.

Furthermore, the patient was fitted with a Passy-Muir valve
on two days prior to discharge and was able to use this
without any respiratory difficulty.

2. Cardiovascular:  As noted above, the patient was
hypotensive immediately post BiPAP and post intubation likely
secondary to the tension pneumothorax on the right side.
Levophed pressor was required to maintain adequate blood
pressure during the patient's first 24 hours within the MICU,
but then this was quickly weaned with decompression at the
right pneumothorax.  After the patient's cardiac arrest,
which as stated above included asystole, then PEA, then
ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, he was
placed on an amiodarone drip for 24 hours.  This was then
discontinued.  The patient does have a history of paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation, however, the patient remained in normal
sinus rhythm during his hospital course.

The patient had no other cardiac issues during his hospital
stay.  He was noted at times to have some hypertension once
he was weaned off the pressors.  The highest blood pressure
was 150 systolic with a heart rate in the high 90s.
Therefore, he was placed on Lopressor for a short period of
time.  However, he did not tolerate this longterm and became
somewhat hypotensive with the use of Lopressor.  The patient
has no history of essential hypertension, and therefore he
was not rechallanged with Lopressor.

3. Thrombocytopenia:  When the patient was admitted, he had a
reactive thrombocytosis most likely with platelets up to
600,000.  This came down throughout his hospital course and
on [**2167-3-16**], the patient's platelet count had dropped to
34,000.  The patient had been receiving subq Heparin since
admission to [**Hospital1 69**].  At the
outside hospital, he had been on Lovenox for prophylaxis.

The degree of drop in platelets as well as the time course
was highly consistent with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
Therefore, the [**Doctor First Name **] test for HIT was sent, and this returned
negative.  However, with the high clinical suspicion, the
patient was kept off all Heparin products.  As the patient's
platelet count continued to drop off of Heparin, Hematology
consult was obtained.  They agreed with the high clinical
suspicion for HIT and recommended sending a second HIT test.
The second test also returned negative as this is a highly
sensitive test for Heparin dependent antibodies and the HIT
syndrome, it was felt that he does not have heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia.  Rather, it was felt that the patient's
thrombocytopenia was medication induced, most likely
secondary to linezolid.

The patient had an extensive workup for this thrombocytopenia
before this conclusion was made, however, including he was
ruled out for DIC, ruled out for TTP, and ruled out for ITP
with a negative platelet antibody test.  While entertaining
the diagnosis of HIT, it was decided to ultrasound all four
of the patient's extremities as HIT can also cause clinically
significant clots.  The patient was noted to have old clots
within his left femoral artery as well as in his left upper
extremity.  Therefore, once the patient's platelet count
returned to within normal limits and showed upward trend,
based on recommendations from the Hematology service, the
patient was started on prophylaxis for further clots of
Lovenox 30 subq b.i.d.  He tolerated this medication well and
his platelets remained quite stable with a platelet count in
he 300's upon discharge.

The patient was placed on Plavix while in the CT Surgery
service after the two stents had been placed in the right
ileac artery.  Even with the patient's thrombocytopenia, the
Plavix was continued as the risk for instent thromboses quite
high within the first month of stent placement.  His aspirin
was held while he was severely thrombocytopenic, but then
reinitiated when his platelet count returned to [**Location 213**].

4. FEN:  As stated above, the patient had a PEG tube placed
on [**2167-3-17**] at the same time of tracheostomy placement.  He
tolerated this well, and his tube feeds were at goal 24 hours
post placement of the PEG.  The patient had a speech and
swallow evaluation on two separate occasions, once
immediately pre-PEG placement and one on the day prior to
discharge to rehab.  On both occasions, the patient failed
the speech and swallow evaluation and was noted to aspirate
thin liquids.  A decision was made that the patient could
have ice chips, but nothing else p.o. at the time of
discharge.

The patient had fairly normal electrolytes and only required
repletion of potassium and magnesium on an infrequent basis.
Even with his profound nutritional deficiency, his coags
including INR were within normal limits.

5. Infectious disease:  The patient did have a leukocytosis
as mentioned above with a peak white blood cell count of
28,000.  This was felt to be due to both steroid use as well
as the infection in the vasculitic ulcers in the patient's
extremities.  The patient was placed on linezolid and
ciprofloxacin for these ulcers.  These medications were
discontinued on the MICU service as the patient no longer had
a white count, was afebrile, and his skin lesions were much
improved.  Of note, the linezolid was discontinued prior to
the development of thrombocytopenia.  As this patient not
infrequently causes thrombocytopenia, the drop in platelets
was attributed to this medication.

The patient was empirically treated for Clostridium difficile
for a 14-day course.  Three Clostridium difficile toxins were
negative, however, with cessation of Flagyl on the CT Surgery
service, the patient developed severe diarrhea and with
reinitiation of Flagyl, this stopped.  Once he finished his
Flagyl course, he had no recurrence of diarrhea.  There were
no other infectious issues throughout the rest of the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course.  He remained afebrile with no
evidence of pneumonia, no line infections, and his skin
lesions did not become reinfected.

6. Vasculitis:  As above, this was diagnosed as a small to
medium vessel vasculitis that was medication related.  It is
recommended that the patient not receive amoxicillin or other
penicillin products for this reason in the future.

7. Code:  The patient remained full code throughout his
hospital course as this was his wish as communicated by the
patient on numerous occasions and as affirmed by his family.
His daughter is his healthcare proxy.

8. Communication:  The patient's family is very involved and
were present every hospital day of the patient's stay.  His
daughter is his healthcare proxy.  The family should be
contact[**Name (NI) **] before any changes are made in the patient's care.
The daughter's name is [**Name (NI) **].  The patient's wife's name is
[**Name (NI) 2147**] [**Name (NI) 25699**], her work phone is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 55255**].  Her home
phone is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 55256**].  The patient's son is [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 25699**],
who also lives on [**Location (un) **], his work phone is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 55257**].  His home phone is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 55258**].

9. The Psychiatry service did see the patient for his history
of depression and anxiety, and followed him throughout his
hospital course.  They recommended avoiding benzodiazepines
and narcotics as much as possible as they resulted in
paradoxical reactions with the patient's mood.  Specifically,
benzodiazepines resulted in hallucinations and altered
sensorium.  Therefore, the psychiatrist recommended the use
of Haldol or other antipsychotics on a prn basis.

Service:  MICU ROM

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 68-year-old
gentleman with a past medical history significant for severe
COPD, AFib, anxiety and depression, who was transferred from
[**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**2167-2-22**] to [**Hospital1 190**] for further evaluation of his COPD.
Specifically, the patient was admitted to the CT Surgery
service for evaluation for potential lung volume reduction
surgery.

The patient's primary pulmonologist at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital is
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 55254**] and he referred the patient specifically to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 952**], a CT Surgery attending at [**Hospital3 **].  The [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course from [**2167-2-22**] up until [**2167-3-6**] has been
dictated previously by a CT surgeon on Dr.[**Name (NI) 1816**] team.  To
briefly summarize their report, the patient was transferred
on [**2167-2-22**] with issues including failure to thrive, COPD,
cachexia with severe malnutrition, and a small/medium vessel
vasculitis resulting in multiple skin erosions on all four of
the patient's extremities.

While on the CT Surgery service, the patient was evaluated by
multiple services, including Dermatology, Plastic Surgery,
Vascular Surgery, Infectious Disease, Rheumatology,
Pulmonary, Nutrition, and Physical Therapy.  The Pulmonary
service recommended inhaled steroids as well as
around-the-clock MDIs including Atrovent and albuterol for
his pulmonary disease.  He had pulmonary function testing on
[**2-25**] that revealed a SVC of 2.98, which is 70% of
predicted, a FEV1 of 0.96, which is 33% predicted, and a
FEV1:FVC ratio of 32, which is 47% predicted.  This is
consistent with very severe COPD.

The patient had a CT of the chest with and without contrast
on [**2167-2-24**] that showed no lymphadenopathy, extensive
emphysematous changes bilaterally, and multiple small
bilateral vague patchy areas of nodularity of uncertain
significance.  There were no pleural or pericardial
effusions, no infiltrates.  An incidental finding was made of
an infrarenal aortic stenosis and extensive vascular
calcifications.  Because of this incidental finding, the
patient had bilateral PVR testing that revealed significantly
decreased flow to the right leg and a normal PVR of the left
leg.  The patient subsequently had bilateral lower extremity
angiograms on [**2167-2-27**], which revealed near total occlusion
of the right common iliac artery and therefore, the patient
underwent two stents by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] being placed in that
artery.

As far as further significant events during his CT Surgery
hospital course, the patient was evaluated by Dermatology and
had multiple biopsies of the skin ulcerations.  He was
diagnosed with a medium vessel vasculitis thought to be
secondary to medications.  The most likely culprit is
amoxicillin, which the patient had been taking for a COPD
flare prior to his hospitalization at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.
There was no evidence of a systemic vasculitis or
rheumatologic issue based on multiple testing including
negative [**Doctor First Name **], negative rheumatoid factor, negative ANCA, and
negative RPR.

Of note, Infectious Disease was also consulted as mentioned
above at the outside hospital.  These ulcers secondary to
vasculitis on the patient's extremities grew out both MRSA
and Enterococcus, therefore the patient was placed on
linezolid and ciprofloxacin to cover these organisms.  The
reason antibiotics were started was that the patient had a
leukocytosis with a peak white blood cell count of 28,000
while on the CT Surgery service team.  Also from an ID
perspective, the patient was treated empirically for
Clostridium difficile infection because of profuse diarrhea,
which improved with Flagyl.

This describes the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course on the CT
Surgery service as noted in a previous dictation.  It was
felt that because of the patient's multiple comorbidities
including malnutrition and this vasculitis, he was not
currently a candidate for lung volume reduction surgery.

The patient was transferred to the MICU Green Team Resident
Only Service on [**2167-3-9**] for hypercapnic respiratory failure.
 For 24 hours prior to transfer, the patient had been having
difficulty breathing and was somnolent on the floor.  Serial
ABGs showed a worsening hypercapnia.  His ABG on the evening
of [**2167-3-8**] was 7.3, 60, and 80.

The next morning the patient was still having difficulty.
Was noted to be somnolent, and his ABG was 7.21 pH, 80 pCO2,
and 80 O2.  Therefore, the MICU team was called.  The patient
on examination was noted to have diffuse expiratory wheezes
and was found to be in hypercapnic respiratory failure.  He
was transferred immediately to the MICU.  A trial of BiPAP
was initiated as the patient had responded to this in the
past.  An A-line was placed in the patient's right arm
immediately.  After 15 minutes on BiPAP, repeat ABG was pH
7.19, pCO2 87, and pO2 had dropped to 52.  Therefore,
Anesthesia was called for an elective intubation.  The
patient was sedated with Fentanyl, Versed, was intubated and
placed on assist control 550/16 100 FIO2.  Repeat blood gas
immediately after intubation was 7.23, pCO2 of 70, and pO2 of
367.  The vent was therefore changed to AC at 50% FIO2, 550
tidal volume by 20% respiratory rate with a repeat ABG of pH
7.32, pCO2 of 55, and pO2 of 101.

Of note, immediately after intubation, the patient was noted
to become hypotensive with mean arterial pressures between 40
and 50 and required the use of Levophed as a pressor.  A
chest x-ray was obtained post intubation that showed no
evidence of infiltrate, no new pneumothoraces, and no obvious
explanation for why the patient had a hypercapnic respiratory
failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. COPD:  Patient has had heavy tobacco use for 30 plus
years.  Of note the patient had recently been hospitalized in
[**Month (only) 404**] for a pneumonia and a COPD flare requiring BiPAP use.
Prior to this hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**], however, the patient
had never required intubation.  A month prior to admission,
the patient had been on p.o. prednisone for COPD flare.
Baseline sats were 93% per outside hospital records.  Patient
was not on home O2.
2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, not anticoagulated.
3. MRSA wound infections in the lower extremities, also
Enterococcus, and gram-negative rods in the wound
infection/vasculitis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives on [**Hospital3 **].  He lives by
himself.  He is a retired Air Force pilot.  He was a prior
competitive swimmer.  He is separated from his wife since
[**2163**].  [**Name2 (NI) **] has two children, who are very involved in his
care, a son who lives on [**Location (un) **], and a daughter, who lives
in [**Name (NI) 51454**].

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM THE CT SURGERY SERVICE:
1. Protonix 40 IV q.d.
2. Thiamine 50 p.o. q.d.
3. Lovenox 40 subq q.d.
4. Toradol 15 IV q.6h. prn.
5. Vancomycin 500 mg IV q.d.
6. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7. Doxycycline 100 mg IV q.d.
8. Solu-Medrol 30 mg q.8h.
9. Albuterol prn.

ALLERGIES:  Procaine, novocaine, [**Female First Name (un) **] anesthetics, and
penicillin.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION TO THE MICU:  The patient was
afebrile.  Blood pressure was quite labile ranging from
systolic blood pressure of 60-190/diagnostic of 40-100, pulse
was 70-120 and was regular.  In general, the patient prior to
intubation appeared very labored from a breathing
perspective.  He was quite somnolent and only responded to
questions with a lot of prompting and shaking.  Patient is
very cachectic.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular muscles are
intact.  Oropharynx is clear.  Heart:  S1, S2, regular, no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Lungs:  Diffuse expiratory
wheezes bilaterally, no crackles.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Multiple ulcers in the legs and arms and some
areas of modeling in the legs.  Neurologically:  The patient
was responsive to commands, but otherwise quite somnolent and
was subsequently intubated.

DATA ON ADMISSION:  Hematocrit was 31.6, white count was 17.5
with 96% neutrophils and 0 bands.  INR is 0.8.  PTT 28, PT
11.  Platelet count was 413.  Chemistries:  Sodium 140,
potassium 5, chloride 103, bicarb 28, BUN 43, creatinine 0.5,
glucose 127, calcium 8.9, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus 4.9.
Urine electrolytes were significant for a FENa of 0.1%.
Clostridium difficile was negative x2.  Blood cultures from
admission and [**2167-2-28**] showed no growth to date.

EKG was normal sinus rhythm, rate 100, normal axis, prominent
P waves.  Old Q waves in the inferior leads and slightly
early R-wave progression.  These EKG changes were old.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with
severe COPD initially admitted to the CT Surgery service on
[**2167-2-22**] for evaluation for potential lung volume reduction
surgery.  As the patient had multiple other comorbidities as
noted including a medium vessel vasculitis thought to be
secondary to medication, extreme cachexia from his COPD and
malnutrition, and likely Clostridium difficile colitis, the
surgery was deferred.  The patient had an episode of
hypercapnic respiratory failure and therefore was transferred
to the MICU for further care and was intubated.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Respiratory failure:  On initial admission, it was unclear
as to the etiology of the patient's hypercapnic respiratory
failure.  Initial chest x-ray on admission showed no evidence
of pulmonary infiltrates, and no evidence of pneumothoraces.
Status post intubation, the patient became more and more
hypotensive and pressor dependent.  While a central line was
being placed in the right internal jugular vein, the patient
became severely bradycardic and eventually asystolic.  A
cardiac arrest code was called, and the patient went from
asystole to a PEA arrest requiring Epinephrine and atropine
dosing.  The patient then entered a ventricular fibrillation
and was shocked multiple times.  The patient then returned to
[**Location 213**] sinus rhythm in the 80s with a blood pressure that
rose using multiple pressors.

In this setting, a repeat chest x-ray was obtained.  This
showed a very large right-sided tension pneumothorax.  A
needle decompression was performed and a chest tube was
immediately placed by the Surgery service.

Based on the above description, it was felt that the
patient's hypotension post BiPAP and intubation likely
reflected the beginnings of a pneumothorax and that with
subsequent PEEP as well as auto PEEP, this developed into a
tension pneumothorax leading to a PEA arrest.  Although this
occurred in the setting of a right IJ placement, it was not
felt that the pneumothorax was due to the right IJ being
placed, although this is a possibility.  As the patient
became hypotensive immediately after intubation, however, it
is most likely that the patient had an apical bleb then
ruptured with intubation.

The patient's pneumothorax resolved with needle decompression
and placement of a chest tube.  He was intubated and weaned
until [**2167-3-12**] at which time the patient was extubated.
However, over the next 24 hours, the patient began more and
more hypercapnic and required reintubation on [**2167-3-13**].  The
right apical pneumothorax was stable and this decompensation
was felt to be due to extremely severe COPD.

As the patient was becoming difficult to wean, it was decided
that it would be in the patient's best interest to have a
tracheostomy placed for further weaning and for patient's
safety.  Therefore, a tracheostomy was placed on Tuesday,
[**2167-3-17**].  At the same time, a PEG was also placed.  These
are both done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with the patient's consent and
the family were also very involved in the decision and agreed
with these procedures.

The patient tolerated the tracheostomy without complications.
He was able to be weaned to CPAP with pressure support and on
the day of discharge to the pulmonary rehab facility, he was
requiring 0 PEEP and a pressure support of 8 with excellent
oxygenation and no signs of hypercapnia.

The patient was continued on intravenous Solu-Medrol that was
eventually tapered.  The day of discharge he was to be
discharged to prednisone 12.5 mg p.o. q.d. as this correlated
to his Solu-Medrol dose of 10 IV q.d.  It was decided to
change to p.o. as the patient no longer had any IV access as
these were all removed to prevent line-related infection, and
as the patient was clinically was much more stable.  The
patient was continued on albuterol and Atrovent MDIs as well.
Chest x-ray prior to admission showed no pneumothorax, no
infiltrates.

Furthermore, the patient was fitted with a Passy-Muir valve
on two days prior to discharge and was able to use this
without any respiratory difficulty.

2. Cardiovascular:  As noted above, the patient was
hypotensive immediately post BiPAP and post intubation likely
secondary to the tension pneumothorax on the right side.
Levophed pressor was required to maintain adequate blood
pressure during the patient's first 24 hours within the MICU,
but then this was quickly weaned with decompression at the
right pneumothorax.  After the patient's cardiac arrest,
which as stated above included asystole, then PEA, then
ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, he was
placed on an amiodarone drip for 24 hours.  This was then
discontinued.  The patient does have a history of paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation, however, the patient remained in normal
sinus rhythm during his hospital course.

The patient had no other cardiac issues during his hospital
stay.  He was noted at times to have some hypertension once
he was weaned off the pressors.  The highest blood pressure
was 150 systolic with a heart rate in the high 90s.
Therefore, he was placed on Lopressor for a short period of
time.  However, he did not tolerate this longterm and became
somewhat hypotensive with the use of Lopressor.  The patient
has no history of essential hypertension, and therefore he
was not rechallanged with Lopressor.

3. Thrombocytopenia:  When the patient was admitted, he had a
reactive thrombocytosis most likely with platelets up to
600,000.  This came down throughout his hospital course and
on [**2167-3-16**], the patient's platelet count had dropped to
34,000.  The patient had been receiving subq Heparin since
admission to [**Hospital1 69**].  At the
outside hospital, he had been on Lovenox for prophylaxis.

The degree of drop in platelets as well as the time course
was highly consistent with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
Therefore, the [**Doctor First Name **] test for HIT was sent, and this returned
negative.  However, with the high clinical suspicion, the
patient was kept off all Heparin products.  As the patient's
platelet count continued to drop off of Heparin, Hematology
consult was obtained.  They agreed with the high clinical
suspicion for HIT and recommended sending a second HIT test.
The second test also returned negative as this is a highly
sensitive test for Heparin dependent antibodies and the HIT
syndrome, it was felt that he does not have heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia.  Rather, it was felt that the patient's
thrombocytopenia was medication induced, most likely
secondary to linezolid.

The patient had an extensive workup for this thrombocytopenia
before this conclusion was made, however, including he was
ruled out for DIC, ruled out for TTP, and ruled out for ITP
with a negative platelet antibody test.  While entertaining
the diagnosis of HIT, it was decided to ultrasound all four
of the patient's extremities as HIT can also cause clinically
significant clots.  The patient was noted to have old clots
within his left femoral artery as well as in his left upper
extremity.  Therefore, once the patient's platelet count
returned to within normal limits and showed upward trend,
based on recommendations from the Hematology service, the
patient was started on prophylaxis for further clots of
Lovenox 30 subq b.i.d.  He tolerated this medication well and
his platelets remained quite stable with a platelet count in
he 300's upon discharge.

The patient was placed on Plavix while in the CT Surgery
service after the two stents had been placed in the right
ileac artery.  Even with the patient's thrombocytopenia, the
Plavix was continued as the risk for instent thromboses quite
high within the first month of stent placement.  His aspirin
was held while he was severely thrombocytopenic, but then
reinitiated when his platelet count returned to [**Location 213**].

4. FEN:  As stated above, the patient had a PEG tube placed
on [**2167-3-17**] at the same time of tracheostomy placement.  He
tolerated this well, and his tube feeds were at goal 24 hours
post placement of the PEG.  The patient had a speech and
swallow evaluation on two separate occasions, once
immediately pre-PEG placement and one on the day prior to
discharge to rehab.  On both occasions, the patient failed
the speech and swallow evaluation and was noted to aspirate
thin liquids.  A decision was made that the patient could
have ice chips, but nothing else p.o. at the time of
discharge.

The patient had fairly normal electrolytes and only required
repletion of potassium and magnesium on an infrequent basis.
Even with his profound nutritional deficiency, his coags
including INR were within normal limits.

5. Infectious disease:  The patient did have a leukocytosis
as mentioned above with a peak white blood cell count of
28,000.  This was felt to be due to both steroid use as well
as the infection in the vasculitic ulcers in the patient's
extremities.  The patient was placed on linezolid and
ciprofloxacin for these ulcers.  These medications were
discontinued on the MICU service as the patient no longer had
a white count, was afebrile, and his skin lesions were much
improved.  Of note, the linezolid was discontinued prior to
the development of thrombocytopenia.  As this patient not
infrequently causes thrombocytopenia, the drop in platelets
was attributed to this medication.

The patient was empirically treated for Clostridium difficile
for a 14-day course.  Three Clostridium difficile toxins were
negative, however, with cessation of Flagyl on the CT Surgery
service, the patient developed severe diarrhea and with
reinitiation of Flagyl, this stopped.  Once he finished his
Flagyl course, he had no recurrence of diarrhea.  There were
no other infectious issues throughout the rest of the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course.  He remained afebrile with no
evidence of pneumonia, no line infections, and his skin
lesions did not become reinfected.

6. Vasculitis:  As above, this was diagnosed as a small to
medium vessel vasculitis that was medication related.  It is
recommended that the patient not receive amoxicillin or other
penicillin products for this reason in the future.

7. Code:  The patient remained full code throughout his
hospital course as this was his wish as communicated by the
patient on numerous occasions and as affirmed by his family.
His daughter is his healthcare proxy.

8. Communication:  The patient's family is very involved and
were present every hospital day of the patient's stay.  His
daughter is his healthcare proxy.  The family should be
contact[**Name (NI) **] before any changes are made in the patient's care.
The daughter's name is [**Name (NI) **].  The patient's wife's name is
[**Name (NI) 2147**] [**Name (NI) 25699**], her work phone is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 55255**].  Her home
phone is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 55256**].  The patient's son is [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 25699**],
who also lives on [**Location (un) **], his work phone is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 55257**].  His home phone is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 55258**].

9. The Psychiatry service did see the patient for his history
of depression and anxiety, and followed him throughout his
hospital course.  They recommended avoiding benzodiazepines
and narcotics as much as possible as they resulted in
paradoxical reactions with the patient's mood.  Specifically,
benzodiazepines resulted in hallucinations and altered
sensorium.  Therefore, the psychiatrist recommended the use
of Haldol or other antipsychotics on a prn basis.

10.  Pneumothorax.  The chest tube was kept on suction until
[**2167-3-20**].  When the air leak subsided, chest tube was place to
waterseal.  Chest tube was then pulled out on [**2167-3-23**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Prednisone 12.5 mg p.o. q.d. to be tapered as per

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old
male, retired fighter pilot, with a medical history
significant for advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, anxiety and depression who has deteriorated
significantly over the past two months requiring
hospitalization.  He was separated from his wife in [**2163**] and
has been living alone on [**Location (un) **] in an isolated situation,
diagnosed with depression several years ago by his primary
care physician and has undergone a slow decline over the past
several years.  He has had several episodes of pneumonia but
was doing reasonably well until [**Holiday **] of last year when
he developed bronchitis which progressed to pneumonia and he
was admitted to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.  Since that point his
decline has resulted in traumatic weight loss and the
development of skin necrosis and ulceration in the bilateral
lower extremities and tips of his fingers during his last
hospital stay.  Despite an aggressive workup during the
involvement of many specialists, they were unable to pinpoint
the exact etiology of the problem.  The patient denied any
fevers, chills or sweats, hemoptysis, new neurological,
musculoskeletal or gastrointestinal complaints.  He denies
issues with his kidneys, pancreas, liver, gallbladder and
heart.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  History of atrial fibrillation; 2.
Anxiety/depression; 3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has an allergy to Procaine,
Novocaine, [**Female First Name (un) **] anesthetics and Penicillin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for a 45 year pack year history
of smoking.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination the patient
was afebrile with vital signs stable, sating 93% on room air.
The patient was a thin cachectic male who appeared in minimal
to moderate distress.  Head was atraumatic, normocephalic.
Sclera were anicteric.  Neck was soft, supple with no masses
noted and no carotid bruits.  Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally, however, breath sounds were
slightly decreased, no wheezes noted.  Heart was regular rate
and rhythm with no murmur.  Thorax was symmetrical without
any lesions.  Abdomen was scaphoid, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities showed no cyanosis, clubbing or
edema, however, they did show larger areas of ulceration and
necrosis, right greater than left in the lower extremities,
upon which the skin appeared to be sloughing off of his body.
The patient also had some areas of punctate ulceration
necrosis on his hands as well.  Neurologically, the patient
had no deficits.  Further detailed lower extremity
ulcerations, the patient had two large necrotic ulcerations
directly inferior to the right kneecap and then from
approximately mid calf down the patient had large reddish
ulcerations with minimal bleeding in a patchy distribution.
On the left lower extremity the patient had minimally
bleeding ulceration on the left forefoot that did not extend
superiorly to the ankle.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 68 year old male with
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malnutrition,
lower extremity ulcerations of unknown etiology who presented
to the Thoracic Surgery Service for further evaluation and
treatment of multiple problems.  On hospital day #2, the
patient went for chest x-ray which demonstrated no definite
pneumonia or cardiac failure, prominence of the right aortic
contour concerning for ascending aortic aneurysm.  The
patient then went for a computerized tomography scan on
hospital day #3 which revealed head computerized tomography
scan which showed no intracranial pathological process,
computerized tomography scan of the torso which demonstrated
no evidence of malignancy, diffuse extensive emphysema with
small peripheral patchy opacities, extensive vasculopathy
with suggestion of infrarenal aortic stenosis and post
traumatic dilatation, an ascending aortic aneurysm measuring
4.2 cm and a prominent left adrenal gland.

At this time multiple consultations were obtained.  Pulmonary
consultation evaluating the patient's pulmonary function
tests were performed which demonstrated severe emphysematous
pattern consistent with the patient's disease process.
Pulmonary then recommended various nebulizer treatments which
were enacted.  On [**2167-2-24**], the patient was seen by
Psychiatry for increasing anxiety, depression and possible
delirium change in mental status.  Psychiatry recommended
Haldol prn for agitation and also recommended checking TSH,
B12 and Folate levels which were all normal.  There were no
further recommendations made at this time, and the patient's
mental status had improved over the course of the hospital
stay. On [**2167-2-24**], the patient was also seen by
nutrition consultation which recommended Boost supplements
t.i.d. and calorie counts and q. day weights to monitor
nutritional status.  Also on [**2167-2-24**], the patient was
seen by the Dermatology Service who made an assessment of
vasculitis of unknown origin or an embolic phenomenon.  Two
punch biopsies were taken at this time, one from the right
lower extremity and one from the left index finger and these
were sent to Pathology for further analysis.  Also on [**2167-2-24**], Neurology saw the patient.  They reviewed the
computerized tomography scan which was normal and had no
recommendations at this time.  On [**2167-2-25**], Vascular
Surgery saw Mr. [**Known lastname 25699**], recommendations included noninvasive
arterial studies of the lower extremities which demonstrated
significant arterial disease on the right lower extremity
with flexions of 9 and 6 at the ankle and metatarsal areas
respectively on the right lower extremity.  In addition,
computerized tomography scan was evaluated and infrarenal
narrowing of the aorta was noted but thought to be
subclinical.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the vascular surgeon at this time,
recommended bilateral lower extremity angiogram with possible
intervention.  In addition Vascular Surgery recommended
Silvadene and adaptic dressings to the lower extremity
ulcerations b.i.d.

On [**2167-2-26**], the patient was seen by Nutrition again.
The patient was taking in approximately 44 gm of protein and
1400 cal/day which was sufficient for the patient's
nutritional needs.  The patient was demonstrating a steady
weight gain.  On [**2167-2-27**], the patient went for
bilateral lower extremity angiogram by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in the
Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory.  The patient was found to
have near total occlusion of the right common iliac artery
and two stents were placed after angioplasty of this area as
well as two stents placed in the left common iliac artery.
The patient did well post procedure with no groin hematoma,
no bruit in the groin.  Immediately post procedure the
patient reported feeling much better in the lower extremities
than prior.  Up until this point the patient had a white
count that was hovering between 20 and 24.  Skin cultures at
this point came back only positive for Corynebacteria.  Blood
cultures have been negative to date.  On [**2167-2-28**],
Infectious Disease saw the patient.  Recommendations included
discontinuing the Vancomycin which the patient was on and
changing it to Linezolid 600 mg p.o. q. 12 hours and
continuing the Ciprofloxacin.  The patient was also
recommended to have Clostridium difficile sent off which all
were negative.

On [**2167-2-28**], the patient's punch biopsy by Dermatology
returned negative for vasculitis in the lower extremity
biopsy sample, but the left index finger was positive for
vasculitis with definite changes in the small/medium sized
arteries.  At this time, differential diagnosis included
systemic vasculitis or drug vasculitis.  Multiple systemic
laboratory data were sent off including Cryoglobulin, C3, C4
which all returned negative.

The patient was seen by Plastic Surgery on [**2167-3-2**] for
possible skin graft treatment for her lower extremity
ulcerations which were somewhat improving.  Plastic Surgery
evaluated the patient and made no recommendations at this
time, hoping for the patient's ulcerations to heal slightly
prior to repeat evaluation assessment as an outpatient.
Secondary to the patient's persistent high white count the
patient was sent for bone scan to rule out osteomyelitis and
on [**2167-3-2**] the patient was sent and test was negative.
Post intervention PVRs demonstrated increased flow of
arterial supply in the right lower extremity.  On [**2167-3-3**], the patient was seen by Rheumatology for assessment of
vasculitis.  Additional laboratory data were sent off
including ESR, CRPNA which were all negative.  Tentative
diagnosis at this time of the etiology of lower extremity
ulceration was drug vasculitis due to Vancomycin.  On
hospital day #13, the patient was seen as fit to be
transferred to a rehabilitation center.
     Unfortunately, he was then was found down and hypotensive
and required intubation and resusitation and transfer to the
ICU. The details of which are in a followup addendum.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old
male, retired fighter pilot, with a medical history
significant for advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, anxiety and depression who has deteriorated
significantly over the past two months requiring
hospitalization.  He was separated from his wife in [**2163**] and
has been living alone on [**Location (un) **] in an isolated situation,
diagnosed with depression several years ago by his primary
care physician and has undergone a slow decline over the past
several years.  He has had several episodes of pneumonia but
was doing reasonably well until [**Holiday **] of last year when
he developed bronchitis which progressed to pneumonia and he
was admitted to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.  Since that point his
decline has resulted in traumatic weight loss and the
development of skin necrosis and ulceration in the bilateral
lower extremities and tips of his fingers during his last
hospital stay.  Despite an aggressive workup during the
involvement of many specialists, they were unable to pinpoint
the exact etiology of the problem.  The patient denied any
fevers, chills or sweats, hemoptysis, new neurological,
musculoskeletal or gastrointestinal complaints.  He denies
issues with his kidneys, pancreas, liver, gallbladder and
heart.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  History of atrial fibrillation; 2.
Anxiety/depression; 3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has an allergy to Procaine,
Novocaine, [**Female First Name (un) **] anesthetics and Penicillin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for a 45 year pack year history
of smoking.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination the patient
was afebrile with vital signs stable, sating 93% on room air.
The patient was a thin cachectic male who appeared in minimal
to moderate distress.  Head was atraumatic, normocephalic.
Sclera were anicteric.  Neck was soft, supple with no masses
noted and no carotid bruits.  Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally, however, breath sounds were
slightly decreased, no wheezes noted.  Heart was regular rate
and rhythm with no murmur.  Thorax was symmetrical without
any lesions.  Abdomen was scaphoid, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities showed no cyanosis, clubbing or
edema, however, they did show larger areas of ulceration and
necrosis, right greater than left in the lower extremities,
upon which the skin appeared to be sloughing off of his body.
The patient also had some areas of punctate ulceration
necrosis on his hands as well.  Neurologically, the patient
had no deficits.  Further detailed lower extremity
ulcerations, the patient had two large necrotic ulcerations
directly inferior to the right kneecap and then from
approximately mid calf down the patient had large reddish
ulcerations with minimal bleeding in a patchy distribution.
On the left lower extremity the patient had minimally
bleeding ulceration on the left forefoot that did not extend
superiorly to the ankle.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 68 year old male with
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malnutrition,
lower extremity ulcerations of unknown etiology who presented
to the Thoracic Surgery Service for further evaluation and
treatment of multiple problems.  On hospital day #2, the
patient went for chest x-ray which demonstrated no definite
pneumonia or cardiac failure, prominence of the right aortic
contour concerning for ascending aortic aneurysm.  The
patient then went for a computerized tomography scan on
hospital day #3 which revealed head computerized tomography
scan which showed no intracranial pathological process,
computerized tomography scan of the torso which demonstrated
no evidence of malignancy, diffuse extensive emphysema with
small peripheral patchy opacities, extensive vasculopathy
with suggestion of infrarenal aortic stenosis and post
traumatic dilatation, an ascending aortic aneurysm measuring
4.2 cm and a prominent left adrenal gland.

At this time multiple consultations were obtained.  Pulmonary
consultation evaluating the patient's pulmonary function
tests were performed which demonstrated severe emphysematous

Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Sepsis secondary to infected stone, complicated by respiratory
failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation
Percutaneous nephrostomy tubes

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 48 yo female with no significant past medical
history who presents from OSH to ED with fever, intubated for
respiratory failure, and likely with infected kidney stone. Five
days ago, pt started to have nausea and vomiting. She was unable
to take in sufficient intake, only being able to take sips of
fluids. Per PCP note from speaking with her on telephone, pt
refused to go to the ED or PCP office for evaluation. Compazine
rectal suppositories were called in and advised to go to ED if
could not keep fluids down in eight hours.

Pt initially presented to [**Hospital6 3105**] with
abdominal pain, back pain, tenderness, and vomiting as above.
Abdominal CT showed moderate right hydronephrosis with a 1 cm x
5 mm distal right ureter stone. Pt was started on dopamine gtt
at OSH and in ambulance en route to [**Hospital1 **], BP dropped to 60s
systolic.

In the ED on presentation, pt was initially verbal, VS: T: 101.2
(103.4 initially); HR: 120; BP: 64/23; RR:22; O2: 93% RA. She
arrived on a dopamine gtt drip peripherally. Per ED intern, pt
was tachycardic on the dopamine which was d/cd as levofed was
started.  Pt was intubated for question of ARDS and worry of
tiring out as RR was in the 40s. When anesthesia saw pt, BP was
in the 60s systolic. A right femoral line was placed emergently
as well as an a-line.  Phenylephrine was started for BPs in the
60s-80s systolic despite Neosynephrine. Pt received 3 L NS in ED
(total 7 L including OSH), was pancultures, and received broad
spectrum antibiotics including: Unasyn (3 grams), Levofloxacin
(500 mg IV), Metronidazole (500 mg), Vancomycin (1 gram), and
Ceftriaxone (1 gram).  Pt received 3 units FFP and one unit of
cryoprecipitate in the ED as was noted to develop petechiae. She
was then taken to IR and a right nephrostomy tube was placed. Pt
was transferred to the MICU on neosynephrine gtt. Cx's + for
pan-S E. coli and abx were switched from amp/gent to levo.   Pt
was successfully weaned from the vent and was transfered to
floor for further management.

Past Medical History:
osteopenia
s/p C-section x 3
h/o uretal reflux
no h/o stones
s/p removal of breast cyst


Social History:

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 48 yo female who presented with urosepsis in the setting
of an impacted right stone. Now s/p right nephrostomy tube.

1. [**Name (NI) 22117**] Pt with urosepsis secondary to infected stone. She
is s/p right nephrostomy tube. She received ~7 liters of fluid
prior to MICU and was weaned down to neosynephrine as sole
pressor. She was given more fluid and was able to be weaned off
of pressors by day 2 in the MICU with the goal MAP of greater
than 65. Because pt had a femoral line, the CVP was watched to
monitor fluid status, but the absolute number was not accurate.
Cortisol stimulation test was done and was adequate (42-->44).
Pt was on an insulin drip initially for tight glycemic control
in the setting of sepsis and this was able to be weaned off.

In terms of antibiotics, pt received multiple ones in the ED.
Given that it was a GU source, and likely a GNR or enterococcus,
pt was switched to gentamycin and ampicillin upon admission. She
then became afebrile and did not spike after that. Urine
cultures from here and OSH eventually grew E. coli which was
pan-sensitive. Antibiotics were changed to levaquin po which was
renally dosed initially. Blood cultures remained negative here
and at OSH.

Nephrostomy tube drainage initially was noted to be ""pussy.""
However, it then was sanginous and then drained serous fluid.
Urology was consulting and felt that the nephrostomy tube should
be left in place for a month and then break up the impacted
stone.

2. [**Name (NI) 27035**] Pt with leukocytosis which continued even when
pt was afebrile, seemingly doing much better and stable.
Differential diagnosis included infection, drug effect. IN terms
of infection: repeat abdominal/pelvis CT scan was done to look
for pocket of infection in the kidney. The scan was normal and
showed no evidence of other infection, though limited by being a
non-contrast study. C. diff was thought of as pt received an
enormous amout of antibiotics initially, but C.diff were
negative.

Continuing antibiotics, eventually her WBC trended downward.

3. Respiratory failure/Fluid status. - Pt with a metabolic and
respiratory acidosis initially. She was intubated in setting of
impending respiratory failure likely secondary to overwhelming
metabolic acidosis. She was vented on an ARDS net protocol, with
a goal tidal volume of 5-7cc/kg. She self extubated and did well
off of the ventilator on day two. Pt then had a large oxygen
requirement up to 6L NC. This was secondary to gorss pulmonary
edema. She was initially on a lasix drip [**2-25**] tenous blood
pressures but started to autodiurese up to 5 L per day. O2 was
successfully weaned off.

4. Acute renal failure- Creatinine baseline 0.7-1.0, 2.7 upon
admission. It was likely pre-renal in the setting of both a
hypoperfusion state given hypotension, made worse by sepsis and
obstruction.  Creatinine peaked at 2.8 and steadily decreased to
normal.

5. Hematologic issues
a. Anemia- Hct down to 26 from 38 baseline. Could be in setting
of volume resuscitation, though seemed a drastic drop. Stool was
gauaic negative and hemolysis labs were negative. A likely
plausible explanation of anemia was that nephrostomy tube
drainage was initially pure blood and thus a large Hct drop was
possible. Hct remained stable and was slowly trending up.

b. Thrombocytopenia- Plateletes were in 80s increased to low
100s. Likely in setting of sepsis. Remained stable.

c. Coagulopathy- INR/PTT initially elevated, likely because of
shock liver and hypoperfusional state (LFTs were all slightly
high). Coags trended to normal.


5. Access- Right femoral central line, right a femoral
([**2105-12-22**]) placed in ED. We correlated A line and BP in arm and
d/cd the A line (5 points lower in arm but changes correlate).
We d/cd the central line and all lines were sent for cultures.
Pt had two PIVs after that.

6. F/E/N- Initially were giving fluid prn with aggressive
electrolyte repletion. Pt was extubated and advanced to regular
diet.

8. Prophylaxis- Initially on pneumoboots changed to subcutaneous
heparin when platelets stable. On PPI while intubated.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 84-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for coronary
artery disease, status post one vessel CABG in [**2147**], status
post MI in [**2149**], status post aortic valve replacement, with
atrial fibrillation, status post cardioversion times three,
CHF with ejection fraction of 55%, who presented to the [**Hospital6 1760**] for elective cardioversion.
The patient had a recent admission in [**2153-10-8**] for
CHF and atrial fibrillation.  At that time, she was started
on anticoagulation with Coumadin and Amiodarone.  The patient
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for admission in [**2153-11-7**] for left
facial droop and slurred speech with evaluation significant
for a negative head CT and carotid Dopplers.  The patient was
discharged to [**Hospital3 **] and returns today for
elective cardioversion.

On arrival to the [**Hospital6 256**], she
was noted to be hypotensive with systolic blood pressure in
the 80s and a heart rate in the 70s, in atrial fibrillation.
She was asymptomatic at the time.  She received 150 cc of
normal saline with an increase in her systolic blood pressure
to the 90s.  Oxygen saturation was 80% on room air and 100%
on 2 liters nasal cannula.  Her DC cardioversion was
uneventful and she returned to sinus rhythm.  Currently, the
patient denied any lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of
breath, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, diaphoresis, or
radiating pain.  She has no recent fevers, chills, or night
sweats.  No abdominal pain, no cough.  She does note pain at
the site of her sternotomy which has been ongoing for three
or more years.  There is an erythematous area that she notes
is improving in the last three to four months.

CT Surgery evaluated the patient in the holding area of the
Catheterization Laboratory and recommended sternal wire
revision.  The patient was admitted to the Cardiology Floor
for monitoring due to her postprocedure hypotension and for
heparinization while her INR came down so that she could have
sternal wire revision procedure on Monday with a normal INR.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation, status post cardioversion times
three.
2.  Coronary artery disease, status post MI, status post one
vessel CABG in [**2147**].
3.  Status post aortic valve replacement.
4.  Status post pacemaker in [**2151-8-8**].
5.  Status post bilateral breast cancer, status post right
lumpectomy and XRT in [**2139**] and radical left mastectomy in
[**2146**].
6.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 55%
on an echocardiogram in [**2153-10-8**].
7.  Hypertension.
8.  TIA.
9.  Status post TAH/BSO.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin 2.5 mg q.d.
2.  Amiodarone 200 mg q.d.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
4.  Lasix 60 mg q.d.
5.  Atenolol 50 mg q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is widowed and lives at the
Alzheimer's Home.  She denied any alcohol use and states that
she quit smoking at the age of 50.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for ovarian cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Afebrile
with a pulse of 68, blood pressure 96/40, respirations 18,
oxygen saturation 100% on 2 liters.  General:  She was a
frail-appearing female in no acute distress responding to all
questions appropriately.  The examination was significant for
a dry oropharynx, JVP at 8-9 cm with prominent EJ pulsations,
rales in the lungs present a third of the way up the left
lung field posteriorly with decreased breath sounds in the
right lung field a third of the way up posteriorly.  No
dullness to percussion.  Moderate air movement.  Heart:
Regular with a I/VI systolic ejection murmur heard at the
left upper sternal border.  Abdomen:  Benign.  Extremities:
Warm with 2+ pitting edema bilaterally from the feet to the
knees.  Skin:  Notable for prominent sternotomy wires and an
area of erythema and warmth over the third sternal wire and
extreme tenderness to touch over all sternotomy wires.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Significant for a hematocrit of
42, platelets 172,000 and an INR of 1.9.

EKG showed atrial pacer spikes and a rate of 69 beats per
minute with left bundle branch block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service.

1.  STERNOTOMY SITE INFLAMMATION:  The CT Surgery Service was
consulted and felt that the sternotomy site inflammation was
not due to infection but was due to erosion of the skin over
the wire.  They were not able to see the patient on Monday
and, therefore, suggested arranging an outpatient appointment
for her at a further date.  It was, therefore, decided that
the patient would go home on her Coumadin and remain on
Coumadin for three weeks in order to prevent increased stroke
risk during the three weeks after cardioversion and will
follow-up with CT Surgery for sternotomy wire revision at a
later time once she is no longer in the window of increased
stroke risk after cardioversion.  The patient was, therefore,
discontinued from her heparin and restarted on her Coumadin
doses.

2.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient remained in sinus
rhythm with rates between 68 and 100 beats per minute with no
events other than one run of three minutes of ventricular
tachycardia which was asymptomatic.  Other than that,
telemetry was uneventful.  The patient was continued on her
Coumadin with a goal INR of [**3-11**].5.

3.  HYPOXIA:  After diuresis with Lasix and Diuril, the
patient's oxygen saturation improved.  She was continued on
diuresis.

4.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient was continued on
her aspirin, beta blocker, and statin.

5.  BLOOD PRESSURE:  The patient was hypotensive
postprocedure with blood pressures as low as 70 systolic.
She received 1 liter of fluids and still appeared dry with
low blood pressures in the 80s to 90s systolic.  She was,
therefore, transfused with packed red blood cells in order to
increase her intravascular volume and minimize the fluid to
her periphery as it was deemed that she was intravascularly
depleted but total volume overloaded.

6.  LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY EDEMA:  The patient was given
pressure stockings which decreased the edema in her feet;
however, there was still 2+ edema in her legs.  She was
continued on her Lasix and Zaroxolyn.

7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient's hematocrit decreased to 29 on
the second day of admission.  Therefore, she was transfused 2
units of packed red blood cells with Lasix in between.

DISPOSITION:   The patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 1761**] Center.  She will return to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] as
an outpatient in four weeks for sternal wire revision.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital3 **] Center.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Atrial fibrillation.
2.  Hypotension.
3.  Anemia.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 8.2 with 78%
neutrophils, 15% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, hematocrit 33.8,
platelets 160, MCV 112.  Chemistries remarkable for a K of
4.9, chloride 95, bicarbonate of 28, BUN 49, creatinine 3.4,
baseline 1.3 increasing to 2.1 recently, glucose of 86.  ALT
202, AST 263, amylase 182, lipase 29.  Digoxin level was 3.8.

STUDIES:  ECG:  V-paced at 70 beats per minute.  No changes
in left bundle branch pattern.

Right upper quadrant ultrasound:  Noted for ascites and
gallstones.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Respiratory status:  Patient developed progressive
respiratory distress on the floor and of unclear reasons
developed respiratory arrest necessitating intubation and
transfer to the MICU.  The etiology of this was unclear, but
thought to be due to aspiration pneumonia.  She had a
negative head CT and no seizure activity was noted at the
time.  She also was ruled out with cardiac enzymes.

She had a chest x-ray suggestive of worsening left upper lobe
opacities and was started on levo and Flagyl with sputum
cultures, which only grew out oral flora.  Part of her
respiratory decline while intubated was thought also to be
due to progressive CHF, though diuresis did not improve her
respirations.

Patient had difficulty weaning from the vent, and after much
discussion with the patient and healthcare proxy, it was
decided finally after several weeks to extubate her with
comfort measures.  The patient eventually expired.  This was
thought to be more humane way of treating the patient given
her comorbidities and likely decline if she were to have a
trach and PEG.  This was not in keeping with her former
values to be independent and not have invasive measures
performed.

2. Cardiovascular:  Patient had known CHF with known very
advanced valvular regurgitation.  After transfer to the MICU
and intubation, she was found to be in [**Month/Day (3) **] with low blood
pressures requiring pressors.  As all her cultures were
negative, etiology was not sepsis and thought to be
cardiogenic versus hypovolemic.  She was aggressively volume
resuscitated resulting in higher blood pressures, but total
body volume overload with her being nearly 15 liters positive
by the end of her admission.

Although we attempted to diurese her, she appeared to be
quite preload dependent and did not respond well to
diuretics.  She was pressor dependent until the very end when
discussions were made to have her be [**Month/Day (3) 3225**].  She was also noted
to be continually in atrial fibrillation, which also
decreased her cardiac output.  Her cardiologist and the
Cardiology team were consulted/curbsided and given her grave
medical condition, there was no benefit to cardioverting her.

3. Elevated LFTs:  Patient had negative hepatitis serologies
and acetaminophen level was normal.  Leading thought was
toxicity secondary to digoxin or amiodarone as transaminitis
decreased since these medications were stopped.  However,
patient's cardiologist believed that this may have been due
to poor cardiac output alone.

4. Acute renal failure:  Creatinine decreased after
aggressive volume resuscitation and maintaining pressors to
maintain blood pressure.  This was thought to be a prerenal,
though patient has progressively poor urine output.

5. FEN:  The patient was continued on tube feeds until
extubation.

6. Glycemic control:  Patient continued on sliding scale
insulin.

7. Code status:  Patient was initially full code, but after
extensive family discussions involving the entire staff, PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] social work as well as Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9305**] [**Name (STitle) 4261**], patient, and
nephew agreed that [**Name (NI) 3225**] status would be most keeping with her
values.  Patient was thus extubated, and pressors were weaned
off and patient was transferred to the floor.

She was maintained on oxygen and Morphine drip, and
eventually expired on [**2-1**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Expired.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a discharge addendum to a prior
discharge summary that covers hospital course from [**2153-12-6**],
to [**2153-12-8**].  This summary will cover the hospital course
from [**2153-12-8**], to [**2153-12-17**].

1.  Cardiac - The patient received two units of packed red
blood cells on [**2153-12-8**], for hematocrit of 29.0 as she was
thought to be intravascularly depleted with a tachycardia and
low blood pressure (as low as 73/38) with low jugular venous
pressure.  As the patient had peripheral edema and rales on
lung examination, it was thought that the red blood cells
would be the most appropriate fluid for volume repletion
since she had trouble maintaining fluid intravascularly.  The
patient desaturated to 88% in room air posttransfusion
requiring Lasix for diuresis.  Over the next few days, the
patient continued to have low oxygen saturation with rales on
examination and therefore, diuresis was continued with Lasix.
A chest x-ray showed increased bilateral pleural effusions
since admission with a possible loculated effusion on the
right.  A CT scan was obtained which showed a loculated right
effusion and a smaller left effusion.  Pulmonary service was
consulted and they thought that the effusion was most
consistent with congestive heart failure since the patient
had a documented chronic right effusion by chest x-ray since
[**2149**], and since on prior thoracentesis the fluid had been
transudative (in [**2151**]).  Thoracentesis was entertained,
however, the patient's INR was 4.8 and therefore the decision
was made not to reverse her Coumadin for thoracentesis.
Instead, she was diuresed with Lasix.  The patient's pedal
edema resolved but she remained with rales in her lungs.
Effusions were decreased on chest x-ray but still present.
The CT was reviewed again and it was felt that the effusion
was not loculated but that it appeared so due to pleural
fibrosis from prior radiation injury.  The patient began to
have oxygen desaturations with increasing lethargy and
somnolence and with her systolic blood pressure falling to
the 70s on [**2153-12-12**].  Therefore, she was transferred to the
CCU for Swan guided therapy.  However, once in the CCU, the
patient refused any invasive interventions and improved with
hydration and with Dopamine infusion as well as with Digoxin.
She was transferred back to the floor and by discharge, her
oxygen saturation was 98% on two liters nasal cannula.

2.  Atrial fibrillation - The patient converted back into
atrial fibrillation on [**2153-12-8**], and remained in atrial
fibrillation throughout her hospital stay.  She was rate
controlled on Metoprolol.  She was maintained on Amiodarone
and Coumadin.

3.  Pulmonary - The patient began to desaturate on [**2153-12-8**],
after blood transfusion.  Although she initially improved,
she began to have increasing oxygen requirements over the
next few days.  An arterial blood gas was obtained which
showed a pH of 7.35, pCO2 of 83, and a pO2 of 206 on six
liters oxygen by nasal cannula.  Her bicarbonate was 43.  The
patient was transferred to the CCU for possible noninvasive
ventilation and possible Swan guided therapy, however, she
refused interventions once she arrived in the CCU.  The
patient was hydrated gently and improved with Dopamine and
Digoxin.

4.  Coronary artery disease - The patient was continued on
her Aspirin, beta blocker and statin with no episodes of
chest pain throughout her hospital stay.

5.  Gastrointestinal - The patient complained of abdominal
pain intermittently throughout her hospital stay.  She had
two episodes of nausea and vomiting, one with 20cc of blood.
There was a transient elevation of amylase and lipase which
resolved the following day.  Abdominal films were obtained on
two occasions which showed a bowel full of stool.  The
patient was treated with an aggressive bowel regimen and her
pain resolved.  The patient was guaiac positive at one point
during the hospital stay but was guaiac negative on the day
of discharge.

6.  Hematology - The patient was transfused two units for a
hematocrit of 29.0.  She responded well to transfusion.  She
had no signs of acute blood loss.  She did have an INR of 1.8
on [**2153-12-12**], and therefore her Coumadin was held for several
days.  Her INR had returned to her goal of 2.0 to 3.0 by
discharge.

7.  Renal - The patient began to develop renal failure in the
setting of Lasix diuresis.  Her creatinine rose from 2.0 to
2.6 and then to 3.4 in the course of 48 hours.  Fractional
excretion of urea was less than 30% suggesting prerenal
failure likely due to diuresis.  The patient had a
contraction alkalosis with a bicarbonate of 40.  The patient
was fluid challenged with 250cc saline boluses but did not
respond until Dopamine was started.  The patient responded
very well to Dopamine at 2.0 mcg/kg/hour with excellent urine
output.  The patient was weaned off Dopamine after two days
of treatment.  Creatinine on discharge was 1.3.

8.  Nutrition - The patient had very poor oral intake and
therefore was seen by nutrition consultation who recommended
Boost supplement three times a day.  She should have
nutrition follow her at rehabilitation with possible calorie
counts.

9.  Speech and swallow - The patient was evaluated by Speech
and Swallow as nursing was concerned for possible aspiration.
Their impression was that the patient did well with all fluid
consistencies but did not chew her food and therefore she
should be given pureed solid diet.

10. Code Status - Code status was discussed with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3489**], the patient's nephew, and [**Name (NI) **], the patient's niece,
as well as the primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 84**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 85**].
Initially, the patient insisted that she wanted to be a full
code.  However, as her condition deteriorated and it became
clear that full code status involved many interventions,
which were at times painful and which te patient refused
(such as arterial blood gases, A line, central line), her
wishes became more unclear and it seemed that she wanted few
interventions and for the emphasis to be placed on her
comfort and quality of life.  Her main wish was to leave the
hospital.  At the time of this dictation, code status is
still being discussed with the family and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 85**].

11. Disposition - The patient was seen by physical therapy
who thought she was extremely weak and deconditioned and
would benefit from acute care rehabilitation.  In addition,
the patient has oxygen requirements of two liters by nasal
cannula to maintain an oxygen saturation above 95%.

Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Electric Cardioversion.


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 35869**] is a 76 year old gentleman with a history of CAD s/p
stenting of RCA in [**2113**], hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and
new-onset atrial fibrillation, presenting with progressive
shortness of breath. His problems started a few months ago. He
started to feel more short of breath, especially with
exertion/walking, and he would experience left-sided sharp chest
pain (non pleuritic, no radiation or associated symptoms) with
severe episodes.  Of note, he was diagnosed with new atrial
fibrillation in [**11-14**], and was started on coumadin at this time
(and was on beta blocker already). He went to Floriday in
[**Month (only) 956**], and while on the plane, he had increased shortness of
breath with the associated chest pain. He also noted the onset
of new bilateral LE swelling.  When he got off the plane, he
went to a hospital in [**State 108**] where he was admitted for 2 days,
a CXR showed LLL infiltrate, and he was started on antibiotics
(completed a 7-day course of a fluoroquinolone).  A BNP was
normal at 50, he was given 40 mg IV lasix, and discharged on PO
Lasix. His symptoms did not improve and in fact, worsened. He
denied any fever/chills/abdominal pain/bowel or urinary
symptoms, but said he was experiencing PND/orthopnea (states he
hardly sleeps at night, can only sleep at 60-90 degree angle)
which had been getting progressively worse.  He denied
palpitations, light headedness, or dizziness, but he stated that
he had had episodes in the past few months where he would just
pass out/thought he suddenly fell asleep.  He denied any
prodromal symptoms before these episodes and denied any tongue
biting, loss of bowel or bladder function.  He does not think he
lost consciousness with these episodes.  He was hospitalized
this second time from [**Date range (1) 35870**], and at this time, he was treated
with rocephin/azithro, V/Q was low prob, bilateral LENI's were
negative, BNP was 126.  To work up these ?syncopal episodes,
neuro was consulted, and CT of the head was negative, bilateral
carotid US showed only 30% stenosis, EEG was negative, and TTE
showed EF=60% with trival PR, borderline concentric LVH.  He was
discharged and returned to [**State **] on the day of
admission.  He came right to the hospital, stating that he had
no improvement in his symptoms of shortness of breath.

In the ED, he was afebrile, 92% on room air, found to have BNP
of 1386.  He was given 40 mg IV lasix with good diuresis.  CTA
could not be performed, for he couldn't lie flat due to his SOB.
 He was admitted for further workup of this shortness of breath.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO/TTE ([**2117-3-4**]): The left atrium is normal in size. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Views are technically
suboptimal for assessment of ventricular systolic function. Left
ventricular function is probably mildly impaired with
inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis. Estimated ejection fraction
?50%. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is probably normal. The aortic
root is moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior
pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. There is at least mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

ECHO/TTE ([**2117-3-16**]): The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be estimated. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of [**2117-3-4**], the findings are similar (trace aortic
regurgitation is now seen - may be due to technical
differences).

CXR PA/LAT ([**2117-3-2**]): The heart is of normal size for technique.
The pulmonary vascularity is difficult to evaluate due to very
low lung volumes. There are bibasilar atelectases. There is a
left retrocardiac opacity that most likely represents
atelectasis. There are no obvious pleural effusions. There are
degenerative changes of the thoracic spine. The patient is
status post posterior spinal fusion of the lumbar spine. There
is no pneumothorax.

CXR PA/LAT ([**2117-3-16**]): IMPRESSION: Persistent patchy bibasilar
opacities, most likely due to atelectasis. Underlying infection
in the left lower lobe cannot be fully excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 35869**] is a pleasant man with a history of known CAD, OSA and
new-onset AF who was first admitted to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 108**] hospital with
subacute on chronic (2-3 months) dyspnea. He was treated for
pneumonia and then was treated for CHF. He was then admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] Medicine for a further evaluation of his breathing
difficulty. The cause of his symptoms was likely a diastolic
heart failure (dCHF), given his chest-xray findings, normal LVEF
on ECHO, elevated BNP and clinical findings and history. An
etiology of his dCHF was not found, but was possibly ischemic.
Early in his course, he underwent successful electric
cardioversion of his atrial fibrillation. This occurred in the
CCU given his progressively falling systolic blood pressures, in
the setting of heart failure and [**Last Name (un) **] initiation. Fluid removal,
via Nesiritide and Lasix was continued for a brief time in the
CCU. He remained in sinus rhythm for most of the remainder of
his course, with paroxysms of atrial fibrillation. His symptoms
slowly improved and success was achieved in lowering his weight
and oxygen requirement. Nevertheless, on discharge he still
required low-level nasal cannula supplemental oxygen and was
somewhat breathless on exam.

1. Dyspnea: As mentioned, the likely etiology of his symptoms
was dCHF, but an alternate etiology possible. His initial CXR
and BNP, along with his increasing weight, lower extremity
edema, orthopnea, and PND all pointed towards CHF. He improved
somewhat with diuresis (via Lasix and Nesiritide), beta-blockade
(Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID) and then cardioversion from AF to
sinus rhythm. of note, a work-up for pulmonary embolism via CTA
at the [**Hospital 108**] hospital was negative. A persistent atelectasis
versus infiltrate of his left lower lobe in the lung was
observed. He was treated for pneumonia at the outside hospital
and also received a five-day course of Levofloxacin at [**Hospital1 18**]
(for a UTI).

2. CHF: The admission ECHO showed an EF of 50%. Again, the cause
of his dysfunction was not known, but was likely diastolic, but
the exact etiology was unknown. He was ruled out for acute
myocardial infarction on admission.  He had an isolated
elevation of his ferritin level, but had no other signs of
systemic hemochromatosis. Futher, systemic amyloid was not
apparent on exam, but was certainly a possible cause for his
diastolic dysfunction. Follow-up ischemic and cardiac imaging
(ie. MIBI, catheterization, or MRI) was deferred to his new
outpatient cardiologists. As mentioned, he improved somewhat
with beta-blockade, a one liter fluid restriction, NaCl
restriction, and fluid removal via Lasix and Nesiritide. He was
to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from EP Cardiology.

3. PAF: He presented with recent onset of atrial fibrialltion.
He underwent electric cardioversion in the CCU given low SPBs,
as mentioned. He was started on Amiodarone HCl 400 mg PO TID,
which was decreased to DAILY given a new-onset tremor. He then
remained in sinus rhythm with rare, brief episodes of PAF.
Coumadin was initially held because of a supratherapeutic INR.
It was later reinitiated at 2 mg PO QHS for an INR goal of [**1-14**].
He was to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2357**] from EP
Cardiology.

4. UTI: He had an initial leukocytosis, peaking at 15.6. He had
no fever or systemic symptoms, but a urinalysis minimal cystitis
(WBC 11) with few bacteria. He was started empirically on
Levfloxacin for 5 day course for UTI.

5. Hypotension: The patient had low SBPs over his course, mainly
ranging from the 90s-110s. However, upon initittion of ACE-i or
[**Last Name (un) **] (one dose of Losartan 50 mg and then 25 mg on two separate
occasions) he had a relatively acute drop of his SBPs to the
70s-80s. He was asymptomatic and his mentation remained intact.
His SBPs normalized to his to his new (low) baseline after
cardioversion and discontinuation of the [**Last Name (un) **]/ACE-i.

6. CAD: He was continued on ASA, BB, and Statin. His nitrates
were held given low SBPs. He ruled out for MI as above.

7. RUE/RLE Pain: The patient had intermitted pain of his right
elbow, hand, and knee along with associated decreased range of
motion, tenderness and warmth. There were no effusions or
erythema. The etiology was unclear, but was possibly pseudogout
(given his x-ray findings) or gout. His clinical picture was
consistent with crystalline diseases in the setting of diuresis.
He was seen by Rheumatology and was continued on Allopurinol QOD
given his known gout history. It was noted that increasing or
decreasing his allopurinol in the setting of a possible acute
exacerbation may have worsened his symptoms. Conditions
associated with pseudogout were sought: he had an elevated
ferritin, and a normal calcium, phosphate and TSH. He was
discharged with Rheumatology follow-up. His pain was controlled
with Percocet, as NSAIDs were avoided given his renal
dysfunction.

8. ARF/CKD: The patient had marked renal sensitivity to both
NSAIDS and [**Last Name (un) **]/ACE-i. His creatinine throughout most of his
course was less than 1, but climbed to the low 2.0's upon
administration of these agents.

pain (non pleuritic, no radiation or associated symptoms) with
severe episodes.  Of note, he was diagnosed with new atrial
fibrillation in [**11-14**], and was started on coumadin at this time
(and was on beta blocker already). He went to Floriday in
[**Month (only) 956**], and while on the plane, he had increased shortness of
breath with the associated chest pain. He also noted the onset
of new bilateral LE swelling.  When he got off the plane, he
went to a hospital in [**State 108**] where he was admitted for 2 days,
a CXR showed LLL infiltrate, and he was started on antibiotics
(completed a 7-day course of a fluoroquinolone).  A BNP was
normal at 50, he was given 40 mg IV lasix, and discharged on PO
Lasix. His symptoms did not improve and in fact, worsened. He
denied any fever/chills/abdominal pain/bowel or urinary
symptoms, but said he was experiencing PND/orthopnea (states he
hardly sleeps at night, can only sleep at 60-90 degree angle)
which had been getting progressively worse.  He denied
palpitations, light headedness, or dizziness, but he stated that
he had had episodes in the past few months where he would just
pass out/thought he suddenly fell asleep.  He denied any
prodromal symptoms before these episodes and denied any tongue
biting, loss of bowel or bladder function.  He does not think he
lost consciousness with these episodes.  He was hospitalized
this second time from [**Date range (1) 35870**], and at this time, he was treated
with rocephin/azithro, V/Q was low prob, bilateral LENI's were
negative, BNP was 126.  To work up these ?syncopal episodes,
neuro was consulted, and CT of the head was negative, bilateral
carotid US showed only 30% stenosis, EEG was negative, and TTE
showed EF=60% with trival PR, borderline concentric LVH.  He was
discharged and returned to [**State **] on the day of
admission.  He came right to the hospital, stating that he had
no improvement in his symptoms of shortness of breath.

In the ED, he was afebrile, 92% on room air, found to have BNP
of 1386.  He was given 40 mg IV lasix with good diuresis.  CTA
could not be performed, for he couldn't lie flat due to his SOB.
 He was admitted for further workup of this shortness of breath.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO/TTE ([**2117-3-4**]): The left atrium is normal in size. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Views are technically
suboptimal for assessment of ventricular systolic function. Left
ventricular function is probably mildly impaired with
inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis. Estimated ejection fraction
?50%. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is probably normal. The aortic
root is moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior
pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. There is at least mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

ECHO/TTE ([**2117-3-16**]): The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be estimated. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of [**2117-3-4**], the findings are similar (trace aortic
regurgitation is now seen - may be due to technical
differences).

CXR PA/LAT ([**2117-3-2**]): The heart is of normal size for technique.
The pulmonary vascularity is difficult to evaluate due to very
low lung volumes. There are bibasilar atelectases. There is a
left retrocardiac opacity that most likely represents
atelectasis. There are no obvious pleural effusions. There are
degenerative changes of the thoracic spine. The patient is
status post posterior spinal fusion of the lumbar spine. There
is no pneumothorax.

CXR PA/LAT ([**2117-3-16**]): IMPRESSION: Persistent patchy bibasilar
opacities, most likely due to atelectasis. Underlying infection
in the left lower lobe cannot be fully excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 35869**] is a pleasant man with a history of known CAD, OSA and
new-onset AF who was first admitted to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 108**] hospital with
subacute on chronic (2-3 months) dyspnea. He was treated for
pneumonia and then was treated for CHF. He was then admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] Medicine for a further evaluation of his breathing
difficulty. The cause of his symptoms was likely a diastolic
heart failure (dCHF), given his chest-xray findings, normal LVEF
on ECHO, elevated BNP and clinical findings and history. An
etiology of his dCHF was not found, but was possibly ischemic.
Early in his course, he underwent successful electric
cardioversion of his atrial fibrillation. This occurred in the
CCU given his progressively falling systolic blood pressures, in
the setting of heart failure and [**Last Name (un) **] initiation. Fluid removal,
via Nesiritide and Lasix was continued for a brief time in the
CCU. He remained in sinus rhythm for most of the remainder of
his course, with paroxysms of atrial fibrillation. His symptoms
slowly improved and success was achieved in lowering his weight
and oxygen requirement. Nevertheless, on discharge he still
required low-level nasal cannula supplemental oxygen and was
somewhat breathless on exam.

1. Dyspnea: As mentioned, the likely etiology of his symptoms
was dCHF, but an alternate etiology possible. His initial CXR
and BNP, along with his increasing weight, lower extremity
edema, orthopnea, and PND all pointed towards CHF. He improved
somewhat with diuresis (via Lasix and Nesiritide), beta-blockade
(Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID) and then cardioversion from AF to
sinus rhythm. of note, a work-up for pulmonary embolism via CTA
at the [**Hospital 108**] hospital was negative. A persistent atelectasis
versus infiltrate of his left lower lobe in the lung was
observed. He was treated for pneumonia at the outside hospital
and also received a five-day course of Levofloxacin at [**Hospital1 18**]
(for a UTI).

2. CHF: The admission ECHO showed an EF of 50%. Again, the cause
of his dysfunction was not known, but was likely diastolic, but
the exact etiology was unknown. He was ruled out for acute
myocardial infarction on admission.  He had an isolated
elevation of his ferritin level, but had no other signs of
systemic hemochromatosis. Futher, systemic amyloid was not
apparent on exam, but was certainly a possible cause for his
diastolic dysfunction. Follow-up ischemic and cardiac imaging
(ie. MIBI, catheterization, or MRI) was deferred to his new
outpatient cardiologists. As mentioned, he improved somewhat
with beta-blockade, a one liter fluid restriction, NaCl
restriction, and fluid removal via Lasix and Nesiritide. He was
to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from EP Cardiology.

3. PAF: He presented with recent onset of atrial fibrialltion.
He underwent electric cardioversion in the CCU given low SPBs,
as mentioned. He was started on Amiodarone HCl 400 mg PO TID,
which was decreased to DAILY given a new-onset tremor. He then
remained in sinus rhythm with rare, brief episodes of PAF.
Coumadin was initially held because of a supratherapeutic INR.
It was later reinitiated at 2 mg PO QHS for an INR goal of [**1-14**].
He was to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2357**] from EP
Cardiology.

4. UTI: He had an initial leukocytosis, peaking at 15.6. He had
no fever or systemic symptoms, but a urinalysis minimal cystitis
(WBC 11) with few bacteria. He was started empirically on
Levfloxacin for 5 day course for UTI.

5. Hypotension: The patient had low SBPs over his course, mainly
ranging from the 90s-110s. However, upon initittion of ACE-i or
[**Last Name (un) **] (one dose of Losartan 50 mg and then 25 mg on two separate
occasions) he had a relatively acute drop of his SBPs to the
70s-80s. He was asymptomatic and his mentation remained intact.
His SBPs normalized to his to his new (low) baseline after
cardioversion and discontinuation of the [**Last Name (un) **]/ACE-i.

6. CAD: He was continued on ASA, BB, and Statin. His nitrates
were held given low SBPs. He ruled out for MI as above.

7. RUE/RLE Pain: The patient had intermitted pain of his right
elbow, hand, and knee along with associated decreased range of
motion, tenderness and warmth. There were no effusions or
erythema. The etiology was unclear, but was possibly pseudogout
(given his x-ray findings) or gout. His clinical picture was
consistent with crystalline diseases in the setting of diuresis.
He was seen by Rheumatology and was continued on Allopurinol QOD
given his known gout history. It was noted that increasing or
decreasing his allopurinol in the setting of a possible acute
exacerbation may have worsened his symptoms. Conditions
associated with pseudogout were sought: he had an elevated
ferritin, and a normal calcium, phosphate and TSH. He was
discharged with Rheumatology follow-up. His pain was controlled
with Percocet, as NSAIDs were avoided given his renal
dysfunction.

8. ARF/CKD: The patient had marked renal sensitivity to both
NSAIDS and [**Last Name (un) **]/ACE-i. His creatinine throughout most of his
course was less than 1, but climbed to the low 2.0's upon
administration of these agents.

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 77 year-old r handed male with PMHx significant for CAD
s/p MI x3 w/ stent, HTN, afib admitted for IVIG therapy related
to recently diagnosed motor neuropathy.
.
- Following history adapted from neuromuscular fellow note of
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] -
.
Pt states that for a couple of years, he has had some difficulty

reaching things on high shelves. He began to have to use both
his
hands to lift anything as heavy as a plate from a high shelf. He

did not notice any other problems at that time. In [**Month (only) 1096**]
[**2115**],
he was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In [**Month (only) 404**] of this
year, he began to notice some dyspnea on exertion while lifting
his paraplegic wife. At the end of [**Month (only) 404**] he noticed he could
no
longer breathe while lying flat. He went to [**State 108**] in [**Month (only) 956**]
and shortly afterward developed severe shortness of breath and
lower extremity edema. He was hospitalized in [**State 108**] and given
a
diagnosis of a left lower lobe infiltrate and started on
diuretics and antibiotics.
.
After discharge his symptoms did not improve. He returned to
[**Location 86**] and was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with worsening orthopnea,
pitting edema and shortness of breath. He was given a diagnosis
of diastolic heart failure with an elevated BNP. There was no
evidence of MI. He was cardioverted during admission and
aggressively diuresed in the CCU. Amiodarone was added. He
continued to be hypoxic and require supplemental oxygen. TTE
showed EF 50%.
.
He was discharged to rehabilitation. Since then, he has
continued
to need supplemental oxygen. He has continued orthopnea and
dyspnea on exertion and always sleeps in a chair. He walks with
a
walker now to carry his oxygen tank and provide a chair if he
needs to rest. He can walk around his house without the walker,
and admits he often dosen't use the nasal cannula at home. He
has
been unable to get a chest CT due to the inability to lay flat.

.
In addition to the breathing problems, a couple of months ago he

also developed paresthesias and numbness in the fourth and fifth

digits of his left hand. This included the palm and the dorsal
surface of the fourth and fifth digits. He also notes weakness
of
the left hand, particulary his grip. His fourth and fifth
fingers
""feel big,"" and when touched feel as though something is between

his fingers and the stimulus. He denies neck, wrist and elbow
pain.
.
He denies weakness in the lower extremities. He also denies
numbness and paresthesias in the lower extremities. He has not
noticed any rippling muscles or twitching. He has had chronic
lower extremity cramps at night for years, but this is
unchanged.
He denies trouble speaking or swallowing, and denies double
vision or increased weakness at the end of the day.
.
A few weeks ago, he had PFTs, which showed an FVC 29% predicted,

FEV1 32% predicted. The FEV1/FVC ratio was 111% predicted, which

is elevated. The test was consistent with a restrictive lung
process. He also had a moderately reduced DLCO.
.
There is no history of fevers, chills, chest pain, rashes
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, incoordination, change in
vision, change in speech and swallowing.

Pertinent Results:
[**Doctor First Name 2841**] - electrophysiologic findigs most c/w multifocal motor
neuropathy w/ conduction block, affecting bilateral median
nerves and ulnar nerve.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 77 yo man with multifocal motor neuropathy, CAD, HTN,
OSA, s/p PCI, hyperlipidemia, restrictive lung disease
(diagnosed [**2117-6-25**] with FVC of 34% predicted)who initially
presented with slowly progressive dyspnea and orthopnea over six
months.  The patient also reported weakness of his left hand
over the last year.  On exam the patient was found to have
proximal muscle weakness in his upper and lower extremities.  He
was also noted to have a numbness from his elbows to his finger
tips bilaterally with weakness of his left 4th and 5th digits.
He also had largely absent reflexes. The patient's [**Month/Day/Year 2841**] study
from [**2117-6-15**] suggested his defecits are from a multifocal motor
neuropathy with conduction block.  He also seems to have an
ulnar neuropathy.  The pt was admitted for an elective 5 day
course of IVIG for this motor neuropathy.  After administration
of the IVIG, the pts creatinine increased from 0.9 on [**7-6**] to
1.4 on [**7-8**], to 5.4 on [**7-10**], and to a peak of 7.4 on [**7-11**].  The
pt was transferred to the MICU on [**7-11**] for this worsening renal
function thought to be secondary to IVIG-mediated ATN, oliguria,
and increasing SOB with a mild increase in O2 requirement.  In
the MICU, the pt was followed by renal.  His Bumex was D/C'd,
Aspirin and Indomethecin were also D/C'd.  Renal US and CXR were
obtained. Renal US showed no obstruction.  CXR show no pulmonary
congestion. Prior to transfer to the floor, the pt was given
Lasix 120 mg IV x1 and chlorothiazide 500 mg IV x1.  The pt
diuresed 2L in response to these doses, and then he further
autodiuresed 3-4 L each day subsequently.  It was felt the pt
had entered into the diuresis phase of ATN prior to discharge.
The pt frequently required potassium repletion (K often 3.1-3.4)
likely secondary to tubulopathy and inability for K reabsorption
during the recovery phase of ATN.  Indomethacin was held as was
his allopurinol, but prior to discharge his allopurinol was
restarted at a lower dose of 100 mg qod. The pts coumadin for
his PAF was initially held given the possible need for
hemodialysis, but this was restarted at 2.5 mg qhs and titrated
up to 5 mg qhs with an INR prior to discharge of 1.6.  The pt
developed a hyponatremia of 128 on [**7-12**] which improved to 137
prior to discharge after he had been placed on fluid restriction
and diuresed.  Prior to and after discharge, po intake was
encouraged as the pt was in the regeneration phase of his
tubules and at risk of dehydration secondary to loss of tubular
concentrating capacity.
.
The pts shortness of breath improved over his stay.  The
etiology was likely multifactorial including ARF in the setting
of diastolic dysfunction and baseline CHF as well as restrictive
lung disease.  The pt continued on his home BIPAP machine at
night.  As the pt is on amiodarone IPF is also possible, but the
pt is unable to lie flat for a CT.
.
Prior to discharge the pt began to c/o intense L hand swelling,
throbbing, and numbnbess.  This was more than at his usual ulnar
neuropathy baseline.  Venous US on [**7-15**] ruled out venous
thrombus.  The pt was started on a 6 day outpatient prednisone
taper as he has a history of gout and his recent ARF/diuresis
was a likely trigger (and his allopurinol had initially been
held).

Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, IVIG-mediated ATN

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 77 year-old r handed male with PMHx significant for CAD
s/p MI x3 w/ stent, HTN, afib admitted for IVIG therapy related
to recently diagnosed motor neuropathy.
.
- Following history adapted from neuromuscular fellow note of
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] -
.
Pt states that for a couple of years, he has had some difficulty

reaching things on high shelves. He began to have to use both
his
hands to lift anything as heavy as a plate from a high shelf. He

did not notice any other problems at that time. In [**Month (only) 1096**]
[**2115**],
he was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In [**Month (only) 404**] of this
year, he began to notice some dyspnea on exertion while lifting
his paraplegic wife. At the end of [**Month (only) 404**] he noticed he could
no
longer breathe while lying flat. He went to [**State 108**] in [**Month (only) 956**]
and shortly afterward developed severe shortness of breath and
lower extremity edema. He was hospitalized in [**State 108**] and given
a
diagnosis of a left lower lobe infiltrate and started on
diuretics and antibiotics.
.
After discharge his symptoms did not improve. He returned to
[**Location 86**] and was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with worsening orthopnea,
pitting edema and shortness of breath. He was given a diagnosis
of diastolic heart failure with an elevated BNP. There was no
evidence of MI. He was cardioverted during admission and
aggressively diuresed in the CCU. Amiodarone was added. He
continued to be hypoxic and require supplemental oxygen. TTE
showed EF 50%.
.
He was discharged to rehabilitation. Since then, he has
continued
to need supplemental oxygen. He has continued orthopnea and
dyspnea on exertion and always sleeps in a chair. He walks with
a
walker now to carry his oxygen tank and provide a chair if he
needs to rest. He can walk around his house without the walker,
and admits he often dosen't use the nasal cannula at home. He
has
been unable to get a chest CT due to the inability to lay flat.

.
In addition to the breathing problems, a couple of months ago he

also developed paresthesias and numbness in the fourth and fifth

digits of his left hand. This included the palm and the dorsal
surface of the fourth and fifth digits. He also notes weakness
of
the left hand, particulary his grip. His fourth and fifth
fingers
""feel big,"" and when touched feel as though something is between

his fingers and the stimulus. He denies neck, wrist and elbow
pain.
.
He denies weakness in the lower extremities. He also denies
numbness and paresthesias in the lower extremities. He has not
noticed any rippling muscles or twitching. He has had chronic
lower extremity cramps at night for years, but this is
unchanged.
He denies trouble speaking or swallowing, and denies double
vision or increased weakness at the end of the day.
.
A few weeks ago, he had PFTs, which showed an FVC 29% predicted,

FEV1 32% predicted. The FEV1/FVC ratio was 111% predicted, which

is elevated. The test was consistent with a restrictive lung
process. He also had a moderately reduced DLCO.
.
There is no history of fevers, chills, chest pain, rashes
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, incoordination, change in
vision, change in speech and swallowing.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 86 year old woman who came to ED with symptoms
consistent with acute pulmonary edema and was treated as such
with Lasix 40 IV x 2 and a Nitroglycerin drip. Because of a
subsequent drop in her BP, she was placed on BIPAP and dopamine
for blood pressure support and transferred to the CCU.
.
The admission CXR was consistent with diffuse pulmonary edema.
Post diuresis, this significantly improved. In addition, on
physical exam, crackles present on admission were no longer
audible and she continued to have O2 sats in the mid 90s. She
was then weaned off the dopamine and transferred to the floor.
During her first day on the floor, her home Carvedilol, lasix
and lisinopril were all held since her BP was in the 90s. On the
HOD#4, these were restarted at carvedilol 3.125 [**Hospital1 **], lisinopril
5 and lasix 40 PO. And on HOD#5, she was discharged on her home
regimen.
.
During this admission, we also considered whether a
catheterization would be necessary for this woman given her
frequent hospitalizations with pulmonary edema. However, given
the acute reversal of her symptoms and the fact that she did not
reaccumulate fluid on her lungs or develop any signs of
respiratory compromise and no signs of ischemia on her EKG, we
felt that this could be postponed for now. She did have a
slighly elevated troponin, but this was felt to be [**1-4**] to
stress.
We did not feel that her lasix required uptitrating as she did
not reaccumulate fluid after being off lasix for 2 full days
during the hospitalization. She was discharged on her home
medications. In addition, clopidogrel was added to her regimen
in the event that these events were due to ischemia.
.
Nutrition was asked to educate the patient on the necessity of
adhering to a low salt diet and to restrict her fluid intake to
prophylax against reaccumulating fluid. She was evaluated by
physical therapy and was fit to return to her [**Hospital3 **]
facility. I had a conversation with her son regarding the
possibility that the patient may be at a point where she
requires more intensive care than could be provided by an
[**Hospital3 **] facility and he was in the process of looking
into nursing homes for his mother.
.
Pt is DNR/DNI. Despite this, we felt that a catheterization
would not be unreasonable in the future if she continues to have
these episodes as patient has a fairly good level of
functioning.

.
RADIOLOGY:
.
CXR AP [**2167-12-23**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Recurrent pulmonary edema with effusion.
2. Air distended bowel with air on both sides of the bowel wall.
While this may be due to overlapping loops of bowel, free air
cannot be excluded. Upright radiographs are recommended for
further evaluation.
.
AXR ([**12-25**]):
IMPRESSION: Dilated bowel loops. No definite evidence of massive
free
abdominal air. Please note that radiograph is limited and only
includes a
portion of the abdomen in the lateral view.
.
AXR ([**12-26**]):
FINDINGS: Comparison is made with the limited portable abdomen
study of [**12-25**]. Again, there is diffuse dilatation of gas-filled
loops of bowel, predominantly in the colon. This is consistent
with a profound colonic ileus. For further evaluation and
possible detection of free intraperitoneal gas, CT would be
recommended.
.
AXR ([**12-28**]):
IMPRESSION: Unchanged markedly distended loops of colon,
suggestive of ileus without evidence for free air.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 41171**] is an 89-year-old woman with history of chronic
diastolic heart failure (EF 70% on echo in [**10/2167**]) with several
recent admissions for CHF exacerbations, severe MR, CAD (MI in
[**2139**]), HTN, dyslipidemia who presented from [**Hospital3 537**] with
shortness of breath. She was admitted to the CCU do to inital
need of CPAP.
.
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Patient's symptoms
exam, labs, and imaging suggested exacerbation of her diastolic
heart failure. BNP 6218 on admission. Pt was diuresed with
lasix, which improved her oxygenation requirement from CPAP to
O2 by NC. On discharge her dry wt was 55.9kg and her BNP was
3200. Because of her low PO intake and risk for dehydration, her
furosemide was decreased to 40mg daily from [**Hospital1 **]. Please continue
to monitor electrolytes and fluid status for adjustments.
Discharged on carvedilol, lisinopril, as well furosemide.
.
# Pneumonia:  On the second hospital day, patient was febrile
and chest xray showed new left lung consolidation consistent
with possible large aspiration event.  Vancomycin and zosyn were
begun, and she became afebrile.  Antibiotics were continued for
8 days. Pt's condition improved. Speech and swallow evaluated
her for aspiration risk and found her to be at extremely high
risk (Dysphagia Outcome Severity Scale = 1). Recommendation to
make her NPO and consider feeding tube was made, however, on
discussion with son/HCP [**Doctor First Name **], the decision was made to let
her eat with precautions. Son is aware of risks. Pt clearly
expressed her wish on prior occasions to not have feeding tubes.
Palliative care evaluation recommended.
.
# UTI: Pan-sensitive E. coli infection was found. Pt treated
with Zosyn (simultaneously with PNA).
.
# CORONARIES: history of MI in [**2139**]. No sign of active ischemia.
Her Trop was 0.02 and 0.03. No new EKG changes, She was
continued on home aspirin, statin.
.
# RHYTHM: v-paced, s/p pacer for 3rd-degree AV block in [**2153**]. Pt
was monitored on tele. No new events.
.
# History of hypertension: BP stable currently but was
hypotensive in ER. Initally  carvedilol, lisinopril were held.
Restarted on transfer to the floor.
.
# Dementia: pt has baseline dementia. Only intermitenly answers
questions. Stable during admission.
.
# Dyslipidemia: hypercholesterolemia in [**2163**]. Continued on
statin.
.
Pt was confirmed DNR/DNI with HCP.

He was admitted on [**2199-10-10**] with congestive heart failure.
He underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2199-10-10**] which
revealed an 80 percent left main stenosis, 80 percent LAD
stenosis, 60 percent distal left circumflex stenosis and mild
osteal disease of the RCA.  He had an intra-aortic balloon
placed and was transferred to the CCU in stable condition.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was a 73-year-old
female admitted to the CCU on [**2182-2-18**] with hyperkalemia and
bradycardia.  The patient had a past medical history
significant for hypertension, glaucoma, and breast cancer
treated with lumpectomy, XRT in [**2176**].  She was in her usual
state of health until [**12-2**] when she began to note shortness
of breath.  She saw her PCP and performed [**Name Initial (PRE) **] chest x-ray,
which revealed a right upper lobe density.  This was followed
up with a CT scan, which revealed a lobulated mass of 2.3 cm
in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe and
bilateral lobe interstitial fibrosis.  Follow-up PET scan was
nondiagnostic.  The patient had a mediastinoscopy, which
showed no evidence of malignancy or lymph nodes.  Lung biopsy
was performed, which revealed pulmonary fibrosis.  Subsequent
spirometry revealed a mild restrictive defect.  The entire
picture was thought to represent UIP.

On [**2182-2-18**], she presented to the [**Hospital1 **]
[**First Name (Titles) 2142**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with a complaint of nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea times several days.  In the waiting room, she
developed presyncope.  She was urgently brought to the trauma
bay, there her heart rate was in the 30s with the EKG
revealing a junctional rhythm.  Her SBP was in the 80s.
Attempts made to place a temporary pacing wire but during the
procedure the patient suffered respiratory arrest.  She was
intubated and resuscitated, and a line was successfully
placed.  Subsequent labs revealed a potassium of 9.8.  The
patient was treated with calcium bicarb, insulin, and glucose
and admitted to CCU.

In the CCU, the patient was started on Levophed and dopamine
for hypotension.  Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to evaluate
her hypotension and revealed an SVR of 2473 with a cardiac
output of 2.2.  Two hours later, the cardiac output was 6.5
and SVR was 898 after pressors were weaned down.  Urgent TTE
revealed normal systolic function, no pericardial effusion.
Potassium dropped to 4.3 after 1 day.  The patient was
empirically treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl
for hypotension, which was thought possibly due to sepsis.
By hospital day 3, she was off pressors, her white blood
count was 16.1.  She was successfully extubated, and her
potassium remained normal.  By hospital day 4, she continued
to have mild respiratory distress despite being extubated.
She was thought to be in mild CHF.  She was diuresed.
Levofloxacin and vancomycin were continued for possible
pneumonia.  By hospital day 5, she developed worsening
respiratory distress, and the patient agreed to elective
intubation.  She was then transferred to the MICU for further
workup and care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

Glaucoma.

Breast cancer.

UIP.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Verapamil.
2. Propranolol.
3. Tamoxifen.
4. Xalatan eye drops.
5. Betoptic eye drops.
6. Calcium carbonate.
7. Aspirin.
8. Folate.
9. Vitamin E.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to the MICU, temperature
98.9 degrees, blood pressure 126/61, and pulse 108.  The
patient was sedated and intubated.  Her lungs revealed
diffuse crackles bilaterally.  Cardiac exam was within normal
limits.  Abdomen was benign.  Lower extremity revealed no
edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA:  On admission to the MICU included
a white count of 21.9, hematocrit of 29.3, and  platelets of
85.

Chest x-ray on admission to MICU revealed persistent
bilateral upper lobe patchy opacities, may represent
interstitial edema plus aspiration.  Continued patchy
atelectasis within the left lower lobe and small left pleural
effusion.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with presumed diagnosis of
sepsis.  Subsequently, she developed a picture consistent
with ARDS and required multiple pressors.  After several days
in the CCU, she was on 3 different pressors and was unable to
maintain her blood pressure.  She was requiring increasing
ventilatory support.  A discussion was held with the family
who decided that the patient will be made DNI/DNR due to the
fact that CPR was likely to be unhelpful if the patient
arrested.  On [**2182-2-28**] at 03:15 p.m., the patient was
pronounced dead.  The family was at the bedside.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2152-3-17**] (PRELIMINARY REPORT)
1.  Selective coronary angiography revealed two vessel coronary
artery disease.  The left main coronary artery was short with no
angiographically apparent flow limiting stenoses.  The LAD had
moderate diffuse disease with a 70% stenosis in the mid vessel
and a 70% stenosis at the origin of the first diagonal.  The LCX
had an OM1 upper pole with a 99% stenosis and slow flow.  The
LCX had a 70% stenosis in the mid vessel.  The RCA was small in
caliber and had no angiographically apparent flow limiting
stenoses.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics were performed upon entry.
Systemic arterial pressure was moderately elevated (aortic
pressure was 160/73mmHg).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
.
CT ABDOMEN [**2152-3-17**] (PRELIMINARY REPORT)
1. Small hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusion.
3. No evidence of reteroperitoneal bleed.
4. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease.
5. Atrophic kidneys. Not significantly changed form CT from [**4-14**], [**2148**].
.
ECHO [**2152-3-17**]
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic function
appears depressed with lateral hypokinesis (regional wall motion
not fully assessed). Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
.
CXR [**2152-3-20**]: (PRELIMINARY REPORT)
2 views of the chest compared to a single view done 4 days
earlier. There are no focal infiltrates or definite effusions.
Mediastinum and bony structures are unchanged including findings
consistent with rotator cuff disease involving the right
shoulder. There is also marked aortic tortuosity and prominence,
this is also unchanged. Over the cervical prevertebral area,
there is a superimposed air which likely represents the trachea
as well as the piriform sinuses. Please correlate clinically in
this patient with fever.
.
CT chest (non-contrast): 1. Extensive aortic and coronary
atherosclerosis with suspected descending thoracic aorta
dissection and intraluminal thrombus, stable. This study is not
dedicated to evaluation of the vascular system and additional
examination might be considered.

2. Right lower lobe atelectasis and small pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 931**] is a 78 year-old woman with a history of
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, congestive heart failure,
end stage renal disease (not yet on hemodialysis) who was
transfered from [**Hospital **] [**Hospital3 628**] for management of NSTEMI.
.
# NSTEMI: The patient was diagnosed with a non-ST elevation MI
at the outside hospital. She underwent cardiac catheterization
on [**2152-3-17**] showing 2 vessel disease(LAD 70%, D1 70%; LCx 70%, OM1
99%).  During cath, the cardiologists were unable to cross the
LCx/OM1 lesion with the wire.  CT surgery was called for
evaluation of possible surgical revascularization given the
inability to perform PCI.  Plavix was held given this
consideration of surgical revascularization in the future.  She
was continued on aspirin and statin.  The patient was not on a
betablocker as an outpatient; however, this was not started
initially after cath due to hypotension (see below). Her
hypotension resolved, and a beta blocker was started.  Because
of ongoing fevers and clinical pneumonia, CABG was deferred and
the pt was discharged home with instructions to follow-up with
CT surgery for CABG in several weeks.
.
# HYPOTENSION:  Approximately 2 hours after catheterization, the
patient was noted to have an asymptomatic low blood pressure of
74/47.  IV fluid bolus was started immediately with some
response and her SBP rose to the mid-80's.  The cardiology team,
including the interventional cardiology attending, and the
attending of record were present to evaluate the patient.  A
stat bedside echo was done given concern for
dissection/perforation since there was difficulty attempting to
cross LCx/OM lesion during cath.  This echo revealed a small
amount of fluid in pericardial space; however, there was no
evidence of tamponade.  The patient was given Atropine given due
to concern for vagal response since she still had a femoral
sheath in place.  She responded to this medication with good
response in her blood pressure (SBP rose from the 80's to
100's); however, this was only a transient response.  A stat
hematocrit was sent given concern for retroperitoneal bleeding.
This value was stable was stable.  She was given a total 1.5L
bolus of normal saline.  The patient was then transferred to the
CCU for further management.
.
On arrival to the CCU, her BP continued to fall, and more
atropine was given (total 1.2mg) along with a dopamine infusion
for augmentation of blood pressure. A triple lumen catheter was
placed in her right femoral vein, and 2 units of PRBCs were
transfused.  She was taken for an emergent CT abdomen once her
MAP was consistently above 65 while on dopamine drip.
Neosynephrine was added for a short period en route to CT, but
was titrated off during the scan.  This CT scan of the abdomen
and pelvis was negative for a retroperitoneal bleed.  On return
to the CCU, an arterial line was placed. The pt. became somewhat
delerious and agitated and was given Haldol 1mg x2 and 0.25 mg
lorazepam x2 for sedation.
.
She did well overnight with improvement in her blood pressure.
Dopamine was titrated off at 12am (total duration approximately
4 hours).   After weaning dopamine, the patient maintained her
blood pressure well in the range of 104-143/50-76.
.
The etiology of her hypotension was thought to be secondary to a
vagal response due to her femoral sheath.  Once her blood
pressure stabilized, she was started on a low dose betablocker.
She remained with normal blood pressure throughout the remainder
of her stay.
.
# FEVER: The patient spiked temperature overnight on [**2152-3-19**]. She
denied all infectious symptoms.  Her WBC count was normal.  UA
was negative, blood cultures show no growth to date.  CXR did
not show evidence of pneumonia, however pt had adventitious lung
sounds on exam. She continued to spike fevers for several days,
and then became mildly hypoxic, so she was started on
levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia.
.
# END STAGE RENAL DISEASE: The patient is not yet on
hemodialysis.  During this admission, her creatinine bumped
slightly from 2.4 to 2.8.  Her FeNa was less than 1%.  She was
likely prerenal with a component of contrast nephropathy from
the catheterization. Her creatinine promptly improved from 2.8
back to her baseline of 2.4.
.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA: She was placed on lipitor 80mg daily given her
NSTEMI.
.
# HTN: She is on norvasc as an outpatient.  This was held
initially due to her hypotension.  She was later started on a

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post right coronary artery stent
secondary to myocardial infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year-old
male intubated and sedated upon arrival.  History was taken
from medical records only.  The patient without history of
coronary artery disease presented to outside hospital with
complaints of chest pain.  The patient noted that he felt
lightheaded and called EMS to be transported to outside
hospital.  Initial laboratories there showed a troponin I of
less then 0.04.  Electrocardiogram with bradycardia, left
axis deviation and ST elevations in 2, 3 and AVF, V3-V5 and
ST depressions in AVL, V2, V1 also with a right bundle branch
block.  He was given aspirin, morphine and fluids in the
field and then the Emergency Department gave him atropine,
started a Dopamine and heparin drip.  At that point he went
into a wide complex tachycardia, which was read as V
fibrillation and was shocked with 200 jewels with conversion
to junctional rhythm of 100 beats per minute and the patient
at that point was hemodynamically stable.  The patient was
given a half a dose of Retavase for lytic therapy and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further evaluation and catheterization.

The patient was intubated prior to arrival to [**Hospital1 346**].  In the [**Hospital1 190**] the patient was sinus tachy, normal axis,
normal intervals, 2 to [**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevation in inferior leads
and anterior leads.  He was taken to the catheterization
laboratory.  Catheterization wet read showed a three vessel
disease with left anterior descending coronary artery totally
occluded, left circumflex was 40% lesion and right coronary
artery with a 95% mid vessel lesion thought to be the culprit
lesion.  He had an angiojet and his right coronary artery was
stented at that point at which point he was transferred to
the Coronary Care Unit for further observation and
management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  No past medical history was recorded.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  The only medication was recorded was Benadryl
prn.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Recorded as two packs per day.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father with myocardial infarction and mother
with myocardial infarction and brother with myocardial
infarction at the age of 59.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs upon arrival to the
Emergency Department, pulse of 71 and blood pressure of
106/palp and afebrile.  Generally he was a frail appearing
male intubated and sedated. HEENT pupils are equal, round,
and reactive to light and accommodation.  No lymphadenopathy.
No JVD.  Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs,
rubs or gallops appreciated.  Pulmonary was not examined.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Sodium 139, potassium 3.6,
chloride 105, bicarb 27, BUN 10, creatinine 1.1, glucose 108,
white blood cell 9.2, hematocrit 42.8, platelet 440, MCV 101.
INR .91 and PTT of 28.2.  The troponin I of less then 0.04.
Chest x-ray showed EP tube in right main, opacity in
retrocardiac, possible atelectasis versus pneumonia and on
arrival his electrocardiogram was pending.  His
catheterization showed an RA of 23/24/22, RV of 33/23, PA
33/22, wedge of 22/24, [**3-24**], LV of 90/22, SVR 1082 and PVR of
25.  His EF was 39% with hypokinetic anterolateral apical and
inferior walls.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was status post stent mid right
coronary artery.  For his coronary artery disease three
vessel disease.  He was continued on aspirin and Plavix and
did well.  His beta blockers were initially held secondary to
bradycardia and negative inotropic effects.  At that point
later on he was switched over two days later to beta
blockers. On discharge date his beta blockers were switched
over from Metoprolol 75 b.i.d. to Toprol XL 150 q.d.  His
lipids were checked and liver function tests were checked.
He had an elevated AST, slightly elevated ALT at which point
Lipitor was not started, but the day of discharge Lipitor was
started given that his AST rise was most likely secondary to
his myocardial infarction insult.  He may need future
percutaneous intervention on left anterior descending
coronary artery and D1.  His CKs were followed post
intervention and the goal was to keep the CVP around 18 to
20.  He did well after transfer to the Emergency Department
and was extubated the next day and weaned off of his O2 and
transferred to the floor.

For his pump status he was later on started on Captopril and
on the day of discharge his Captopril t.i.d. was switched to
Lisinopril q.d. for after load reduction.

Rhythm, his electrolytes were checked regularly.  The goal
was to keep his K over 4 and his magnesium over 2.  Initially
he was continued on the Lidocaine drip until the morning
after admission to the Coronary Care Unit at which point he
was discontinued off the Lidocaine.  He had an atropine at
bedside for possible bradycardia and secondary hypotension
secondary to bradycardia, which was not used and his beta
blockers as we noted earlier was held on the first day and
later on started as he tolerated it.  The day after admission
he was started on Levaquin for presumed right lower lobe
consolidation secondary to community acquired pneumonia.  The
patient did well and has been afebrile and white blood cell
count decreasing daily since transfer to the floor.  For him
to continue a ten day course of Levaquin.  He is now on day
three of ten and will continue the next seven days when
discharged to home or to rehab.

Gastrointestinal, no issues.  Tolerating his medications and
his diet well.

The patient was sent to rehab center for further evaluation
and further treatment.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
Inferior myocardial infarction status post right coronary
artery stent.

RECOMMENDED FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with his
primary care physician and also with cardiologist in the next
week or two for post discharge care.  Call for an
appointment.

cholecystectomy.  He tolerated the procedure well without
complications.  He did well initially postoperatively but
then he noticed to have an increased scleral icterus.  His
LFTs were checked and his alkaline phosphatase was 671 with
bilirubin going up to 6.4.  His amylase and lipase were
normal.  His creatinine was also rising up to 2.2.  He
underwent another ERCP which showed dilatation of CVD and
multiple blood clots in common bile duct along with one
yellow stone.  The sphincterotomy site was bicapped for
possibility of bleeding from the sphincterotomy site and
double pigtail stent was placed into common bile duct for
drainage.  After this ERCP bilirubin peaked at 7.4 with
alkaline phosphatase at 1100 and then started to slowly
decrease.  White count at the time was ranging between 12 and
17.  He was afebrile.  His blood sugars were under good
control.  He was tolerating regular diet.  On post ERCP day
#4, the patient was noticed to be passing several stools with
blood clots.  He became lightheaded and his hematocrit
dropped from 29 to 24 and urgent ERCP was done which showed
oozing from the sphincterotomy site with pulsating vessel on
the bottom and stent eroding injury in sphincterotomy.  Due
to close proximity of the sphincterotomy site to pancreatic
duct, BICAP could not be applied anymore but the vessel was
injected with Epinephrine several times and seemed to stop.
The patient was admitted to surgical ICU for close
observation and serial hematocrits.  He was transfused
several units of packed red blood cells around the ERCP but
then his hematocrits were stable.  He was eventually
transferred back from the surgical ICU to regular floor and
his diet was slowly advanced.  He tolerated this well.  He
was discharged home on postoperative day #14.  At the time of
discharge he was afebrile, stable, with heart rate of 73,
blood pressure 140/60, blood sugars were well controlled.  On
the day of discharge his white count was 16.7, hematocrit
26.3 which was stable, platelet count 308,000, sodium 141,
potassium 4.1, chloride 104, CO2 26, BUN 20 and creatinine
1.3, glucose in the morning was 94.  His FK levels were 16.3
on discharge.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3624**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for PEG placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of left subclavian central line (removed), and right
internal jugular central line (removed)

Right sided thoracentesis for pleural effusions


History of Present Illness:
61 year-old male with longstanding DM type 1 with triopathy,
status post CRT [**2196**] (baseline creat 2.9-3.0 in [**3-/2203**]),
recurrent UTIs with MDR organisms, history of MRSA sepsis/osteo,
initially transferred on [**10-17**] from [**Hospital3 2737**] for PEG
placement.
*
He was originally admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2203-10-4**] with mental
status changes. His w/u was remarkable for VRE UTI (only 1000
colonies) and a LLL pneumonia. He was initially started on
Cefepime, changed to Imipenem and Flagyl. A repeat urine culture
grew Burkholderia cepacia sensitive to Zosyn, and Zosyn therapy
was initiated on [**10-12**]. Blood cx negative. A follow-up CXR
showed resolution of his LLL pneumonia. A tagged WBC scan was
also performed and negative for infection. He remained
disoriented despite treatment of his infection, and he was felt
to be continually scratching his left biceps and having facial
twitching. Neurology was consulted. Head CT showed mild atrophy
but was otherwise negative. MRI showed marked atrophy, as well
as subtle changes in the posterior limb of the internal capsule
that could possibly represent small subacute punctate infarcts.
EEG was requested, but deferred [**12-29**] ""scheduling difficulties"".
Per neurology, Mr. [**Known lastname 1001**] was loaded with Dilantin for possible
seizure activity, with some subsequent improvement in his mental
status.
*
Still at the OSH, his Hct on admission was noted to be 25, and
he was transfused 2 units of PRBCs. He failed a bedside swallow
evaluation, and a barium swallow showed evidence of penetration
and aspiration. An NGT was placed. The patient reportedly did
not want a PEG tube, but was deemed incompetent to make
decisions by psychiatry. While in the hospital, he was begun on
Risperdal and Celexa was increased.
*
On the day of transfer ([**10-17**]), his lab work was remarkable for
a HCO3 drop 20-->15, with development of an anion gap acidosis.
He was started on IVF with dextrose, and given 1 amp of sodium
bicarbonate.  On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he was hemodynamically
stable. However, his initial lab work was remarkable for an
anion gap of 22, with HCO3 of 9, glucose of 362. ABG done
7.23/22/50 (?arterial). U/A positive for ketones.  Of note,
standing insulin had been held at outside hospital.  He was
given insulin SC X few doses, then started on insulin drip on
the floor on [**10-18**], along with IVF, with eventual closure of his
gap. Coincident with the metabolic derangements, however, he was
noted to have declining mental status (responsive only to pain
at time of transfer), and he was transferred to the MICU for
further care.
*
In the MICU, he was continued on the insulin drip overnight,
discontinued on [**10-19**] at 1000 after overlap with NPH. AG closed.
[**Last Name (un) **] consulted, with recommendation to start Lantus. Regarding
his mental status, neurology was consulted. LP was performed
with OP 9, WBC 4, RBC 0, TP 93, Gluc 145, gram stain negative,
cryptococcal antigen negative, cultures pending. He was loaded
with Dilantin on [**10-18**] at night pending EEG on [**10-19**].
Preliminary report negative for seizure activity. Per neurology,
Dilantin was tapered off.

[**Hospital1 18**]:
[**10-18**] CXR: Probable bibasilar pneumonia
[**10-18**] Renal transplant U/S: Normal
[**10-19**] CT head: No intracranial hemorrhage. No major vascular
territorial infarction.
[**10-19**] EEG: Bursts of generalized slowing consistent with
encephalopathy. .
[**10-20**] MRI with gadolinium, stroke protocol: Mild-to-moderate
brain atrophy and a chronic lacune in the posterior limb of the
left internal capsule unchanged from the previous MRI of [**2202-3-31**].
There are no MRI signs of posterior encephalopathy seen. No mass
effect or hydrocephalus noted. No acute infarcts are seen.
[**10-24**] EGD: Gastric antrum, mucosal biopsy - negative for H.
pylori
[**10-27**] CT sinuses: No air-fluid levels to suggest acute
sinusitis. Mild mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses, as
described.
[**10-28**] V/Q Scan: Indeterminate lung scan. There are bilateral
areas of decreased perfusion within the lung bases,
asymmetrically with a larger defect on the right. Although the
pattern of this perfusion could be explained by bilateral
pleural effusion, in the face of these abnormalities, it is
difficult to exclude a pulmonary embolism.
[**10-31**] CT Chest without contrast: 1. Large bilateral pleural
effusions with associated compressive atelectasis that are
little changed when compared to [**2202-4-18**]. Otherwise, clear
lungs.  2. Slightly dilated esophagus  3. Dilatation of the
extrahepatic biliary system with a probable calcified filling
defect in the distal common duct. Clinical correlation is
advised.




Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 61 yo male with longstanding DM type 1 with
triopathy, s/p CRT in [**2196**] on immunosuppression, transferred
from OSH with UTI, change in mental status, in DKA. DKA
resolved. Also being anticoagulated for left DVT, likely PE.
Moderate to large pleural effusions bilaterally s/p right
thoracentesis.  Pt has had chronic complaints of chest pain x >1
month, with negative work-ups, pain likely due to combination of
costochondritis plus possible PE.  Pt also with UGIB,
esophagitis, duodenitis, duodenal ulcer not actively bleeding,
and Hct stable on anticoagulation. Treated for UTI with Zosyn,
however, pt found to have new UTI during admission with fever,
which was treated w/ Meropenem.
*
1) PE/DVT/Chest pain:
- Pt complaining of chest pain which he reports to have had for
greater than 1 month, pleuritic or with exertion.  EKGs showed
no changes from baseline, no ischemic changes. He had elevated
cardiac enzymes, which were felt to be secondary to his poor
renal clearance in addition to possible demand ischemia as they
were drawn during a period of anemia/UGIB.  He had lower
extremity dopplers which were positive for DVT in left
superficial femoral vein, extending to beginning of popliteal.
A V/Q scan was performed as the pt was unable to have a CTA due
to his renal status; however, the study was suboptimal, unable
to perform ventilation portion of study - on perfusion scan,
unable to visualize bases [**12-29**] bilateral pleural effusions,
therefore unable to r/o PE's.  The pt was started on Heparin;
Coumadin was started [**11-1**] at 3 mg, then increased to 5 mg to
reach therapeutic INR of 1.7.
- The patient also had bilateral pleural effusions which were
present on chest CT's from a year ago.  On [**2203-11-1**], an
ultrasound guided thoracentesis of right pleural effusion was
performed, 1.2L was removed.  Pleural fluid showed no PMN's or
organisms, LDH ratio indicative of transudative process, pleural
cx's NEGATIVE bacteria, fungus, AFB smear, and cytology NEGATIVE
for malignancy.
- Pt also had reproducible CP on palpation over sternum,
possible costochondritis.  Rib Xray [**10-31**] negative for fracture.
*
2) ID:  The patient completed 2 week course of Zosyn for UTI as
described above on [**10-22**].  However, the pt subsequently became
febrile [**10-25**] accompanied by change in mental status, increased
WBC - now has been afebrile with much improved mental status and
decreasing WBC.  Broad spectrum abx started [**10-27**], with
Vancomycin renally dosed (discontinued) and Zosyn; however,
[**10-26**] Urine Cx results + for non-fermenter not pseudomonas,
intermediate sensitivity to Zosyn, sensitive to Meropenem.
Ruled out for PNA, sinusitis, C. diff, line infection. Zosyn was
therefore discontinued, and pt was treated with Meropenem 500
[**Hospital1 **] IV x7 days, completed [**11-7**].  The patient also had yeast on
UA/UCx, and was started on Fluconazole [**11-5**] x ~10 day course.
The pt was subsequently afebrile with normal WBC, stable mental
status.
.
ID Work-up:
- Central line d/c'd [**10-27**], placed [**10-18**]; new RIJ placed [**10-26**].
- C.diff negative [**10-26**] - diarrhea, likely from GI blood.
- Blood cultures 11/22, 23 negative
- [**10-25**] KUB: No free air or obstruction
- [**10-27**] CXR: Small bilateral pleural effusions
- [**10-27**] CT Sinuses: No acute sinusitis; some paranasal sinus
thickening
- [**10-27**] Catheter tip: NO SIGNIFICANT GROWTH
- [**10-25**], 30 Blood cultures NO GROWTH
*
3) GI: Upper GI bleed coffee ground emesis [**10-22**], and again on
[**10-25**], requiring transfusions of PRBC's, total 4 units.  EGD was
performed [**10-24**], and showed esophagitis, duodenitis, duodenal
ulcer, no active bleeding.  An NGT was placed for gastric
decompression, d/c'd [**10-27**].  Hct stable on anticoagulation.
[**10-24**] EGD Biopsy negative for H. Pylori, Protonix PO BID,
Sucralfate QID.
- The pt also developed fleeting RUQ pain.  Incidental finding
on chest CT [**10-31**], showed dilatation of the extrahepatic biliary
system with a calcific density in the expected location of the
distal common duct.  RUQ resolved, LFT's and bilirubin normal
except for increased Alk Phos ([**10-18**] 208, [**11-3**] 439, [**11-4**] 452).
The pt may have some common bile duct stone/obstruction, given
CT finding, however, he has declined ERCP despite discussing
possibility for progression to infection.
*
4) DM type 1/DKA:
- DKA resolved. Basal insulin had been held at OSH (transferred
only on RISS). Pt's blood sugar was quite labile, fluctuating
depending upon PO status, infectious states, and had period of
both low FSG's to 30's necessitating D50, as well as
hyperglycemia to 477.  He had FSG's checked qACHS, and at 3AM.
His current regimen includes Glargine 18 u at NOON daily, as
well as sliding scale included.
*
5) Delta MS:
- The pt had an extensive work-up for initial changes in mental
status, including an EEG which showed no epileptiform activity,
LP with elevated protein and glucose, no evidence of infection,
normal OP, negative cultures, negative for CMV, [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] Virus, VZV.
MRI showed mild-to-moderate brain atrophy and a chronic lacune
in the
posterior limb of the left internal capsule unchanged from the
previous MRI of [**2202-3-31**], no MRI signs of posterior encephalopathy
seen, no mass effect or hydrocephalus noted, no acute infarcts.

- The pt's mental status changes were attributed to combination
of acute infection as well as hyperglycemia/DKA.  He
demonstrates mental status deterioration when febrile or
infected, and when blood sugars are either elevated or low.  The
pt now at his new baseline, is awake and alert, speaking
fluently, and cooperative with exam.
*
6) S/p renal transplant:
- The pt's immunosuppresion regimen was adjusted several times
during course of admission.  Regimen on discharge includes:
** Tacrolimus 1.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
** Sirolimus 2 mg MWF, 1 mg TThSaSun
** Prednisone 4 mg qd
- The pt's Cr slightly increased during admission to peak of
2.9. This may have been in the context of taking sublingual
Tacrolimus while NPO, which per pharmacy causes greater
bioavailability of drug and possible renal effect.  Cr
subsequently decreased to 2.6. Medications were adjusted for
CrCl <30.
*
7) Heme/Anemia: Upper GI bleed, plus anemia of chronic disease.
Hct decreased acutely in context of coffee ground emesis, with
Hct down to low of 20; received 1 unit PRBC's [**10-22**] after
initial GIB, and an additional 3 units [**10-26**].  Pt was on Epogen,
decreased steadily from 8000 units 3X/week to [**2197**] units
3x/week. Hct remained stable for the last several weeks of
admission, even while therapeutic on anticoagulation.  Last Hct
prior to discharge was 36.2
*
8) FEN:
- Pt was initially NPO while he had initial mental status
changes.  However, after treatment for DKA/hyperglycemia and
infections, he passed a bedside speech and swallow with no
aspiration, was allowed to commence PO diet.
*
9) CV: Patient with HTN, CAD.
-Pt had elevated blood pressures during last few weeks of
admission.  Hydralazine had been d/c'd [**10-26**] and amlodipine
decreased to 5 qd in context of GI bleed and anemia.  However,
amlodipine was increased back to 10 as pt subsequently
hypertensive. Lasix 20 mg qd was also started [**11-3**] secondary to
HTN
*
10) DERM: The pt was seen by dermatology for a scaling plaque,
possible squamous cell CA on left temple.  Will need to schedule
excisional biopsy as outpatient in derm clinic [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1971**].
*
11) Psych:  Pt seen by psych consult [**10-31**] for possible
depression, no active suicidal ideation, but expressed desire to
not pursue major interventions to prolong life; he is not
denying any specific procedures at this time.  Per psychiatry,
pt does not appear to be suicidal, and his wishes to limit
invasive procedures is reasonable.  Celexa increased to 30 mg
qd.
*
12) PT/OT: Evaluated by PT/OT during admission, rehab
recommmended for ambulation and mobilization given left BKA,
deconditioning.

Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]


The patient is a 59 year old, diabetic male status post renal
transplant in [**2196**] and right THR in [**2197**], who was admitted
from an outside hospital on the 26th with approximately seven
days of right hip pain and chills.  At that time the patient
also had an increasing creatinine with right upper quadrant
tenderness on exam.  At the outside hospital the patient was
also diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia.  A right upper quadrant
ultrasound revealed a 1.5 cm CBD with stone.  Upon initial
consultation, the renal service felt that the patient's
worsening creatinine was consistent with ATN with question of
FK toxicity.  The patient was intubated on [**3-24**] for
airway protection.  The patient had fluoro guided aspiration
of the right hip on the 28th and 29th.  He had an ERCP
performed on [**3-26**], hospital day five, for removal of CBD
stone.  An MRI on hospital day five also revealed iliopsoas
bursitis.  As a result, the orthopaedic service was consulted
and removed the right hip prosthesis and replaced it with a
Girdlestone on hospital day eight.  The patient was in the
SICU on a ventilator and was getting nutrition by tube feeds.
Significant events while on the unit were continued fevers.
On hospital day 11 the patient had a postpyloric feeding tube
placed and Zosyn was started for t-max of 100.7 and a white
count of 17.9, trending down to 16.6.  Also with positive
sputum cultures growing out GNR.

By hospital day 15 the patient's creatinine had improved back
to 2.5.  However, he began to exhibit profound weakness and
cogwheel rigidity.  As a result, the question of some sort of
neurologic deficit was raised and a workup was begun.  On
hospital day 15 EEG was performed which revealed diffuse
encephalopathy without seizures.  EMG was also performed and
revealed severe generalized polymyopathy.  No clear
polyneuropathy with no clear evidence of myopathy.  Central
dysfunction seemed to be the cause or major source of
weakness.  On hospital day 16 the patient had a tracheostomy
placed due to his dependent ventilation needs.  The patient
was seen by neurology on hospital day 18.  The impression was
patient with evidence of encephalopathy and severe sensory
motor polyneuropathy on the background of staph bacteremia.
Their impression was that this was likely secondary to acute
problems including infection, renal failure and medications.
However, no definitive cause was identified.  Patient was
continued on his regimen of medications.

Meanwhile, the patient's renal function had continued to
improve with his creatinine dropping down to 2.0.  However,
the patient continued to have low grade fevers and workup was
continued.  On hospital day 20 the patient had coffee ground
emesis aspiration.  As a result the patient was placed back
on the vent.  Pancultures were started.  Tube feeds were
held.  The patient ending up spiking to 102.7.  The patient's
operative site where the Girdlestone was performed was deemed
to be erythematous and full.  It was hypothesized that a
possible tap would make sense, however, due to the patient
being on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage, it was decided
to take a wait-and-see approach.  On hospital day 23 the
patient had a PEG placed and continued to spike some low
grade temperatures.  However, the wound site began to improve
on its own and became less suspicious.  As a result, it was
decided to not intervene at that time.  The patient continued
to spike fevers and with cultures pending.  The patient's
medications were titrated as well, however, his white count
was 11.2 on hospital day 28 with no other signs or symptoms
of infection.  Due to concern for fluid collection,
thoracentesis was performed on the right lung which revealed
900 cc.  Chest x-ray was negative for pneumo, however, the
patient had fungemia as a result and was started on
fluconazole on hospital day 29.  On hospital day 31 an ophtho
consult was sought to rule out any ophthalmologic
involvement, which was the case.  The patient continued on
fluc.  Amphotericin B was held off to treat the candidemia.

On hospital day 34 the patient was taken up to the floor.
The patient received aggressive P.T. and O.T. therapy while
on the floor.  He was also screened for rehab.  On hospital
day 43 the patient will be discharged to an acute rehab
hospital.

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66 year old
gentleman with a history of obesity, peripheral vascular
disease, hypertension and heavy tobacco use was admitted
initially to [**Hospital3 1280**] on [**7-19**] complaining of chest pressure,
dizziness, weakness, diaphoresis and hypotension.  He was in
his usual state of health until 11:00 p.m. that night when he
took a double dose of Zestril and suffered an episode of
nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis and chest pressure [**5-25**] without
relief which lasted about three hours until he came to the
emergency department.  In the E.D. patient's blood pressure
was 90/58, heart rate 82.  Within an hour patient's systolic
blood pressure dropped to 45, heart rate dropped to 32 and
patient was found in 2:1 heart block.  Patient received 0.5
mg of atropine and 1 mg of epi after which patient went into
SVT at a rate of 180.  Patient was cardioverted out of this
rhythm with 50 joules after which patient's systolic blood
pressure dropped to the mid-60s and patient was started on
dopamine 10 mcg per kg per hour.  Patient was transferred to
the CCU at [**Hospital3 1280**].  His EKG showed sinus tachycardia with
frequent ectopy.  Per notes from the outside hospital, his
EKG was suspicious for right sided MI especially in the
context of receiving aggressive fluid replacement, close to 4
liters, and remaining persistently hypotensive.  Patient was
started on acute coronary syndrome protocol, aspirin, heparin
drip, Integrilin drip.  Beta blocker was held secondary to
bradycardia.  Dopamine drip was weaned off and Neo drip was
started.  The next morning patient had an echocardiogram
which showed ejection fraction of 40% and inferior/right
ventricular hypokinesis.  Patient's CK peaked at 1293.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for cardiac catheterization.  On arrival to [**Hospital1 1444**], patient was chest pain free.
He was on Neo-Synephrine drip with blood pressure of 140/100,
pulse 75.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.  Peripheral vascular
disease, status post right carotid endarterectomy in [**2172**].
History of TIA.  History of anxiety disorder.  History of
obesity.  History of heavy tobacco use.

MEDICATIONS:  Zestril, Paxil 5 mg p.o. q.d., Xanax 0.25 mg
p.o. q.i.d., aspirin.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Aspirin, heparin, Integrilin,
Neo-Synephrine 20 mcg per minute, Protonix 40 p.o. q.d.,
Paxil 10 p.o. q.d., Xanax, Levaquin 500 p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease.  Father died of
myocardial infarction at the age of 79.  Diabetes in
patient's mother.  Hepatocellular carcinoma in patient's
father.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  More than 50 pack year smoking history.
Alcohol use one to two drinks per day.  Patient is retired.
He has four children.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer to the cardiac intensive
care unit, the patient's temperature was 98.2, pulse 82,
blood pressure 112/66, respirations 22, 95% on 3 liters,
pulsus paradoxus 3 to 5 mm. Patient was on Neo-Synephrine 0.2
mcg per minute.  In general, patient demonstrated labored
breathing, was speaking in short sentences, was lying in bed
in mild respiratory distress.  HEENT patient had very mild
right eyelid droop.  Pupils were equal, round, and reactive
to light and accommodation.  There was poor dentition, but
normal oropharyngeal mucosa.  Neck no carotid bruits.  There
was 3 to 4 cm jugular venous distention above the clavicle.
Pulmonary there was poor air movement, extensive audible
wheezing in all fields, difficult to appreciate crackles.
Cardiovascular distant heart sounds with no murmurs, gallops
or rubs noted.  Abdomen positive bowel sounds, distended and
tight, but no fluid wave, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities
no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Normal peripheral pulses.
Neurologic was intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Peak CK 1500.  White count 16.5, hematocrit
39.3, platelets 183.  Sodium 138, potassium 4.4, chloride
104, bicarb 28, BUN 17, creatinine 1.0, glucose 122.  Normal
LFTs.  UA showed small blood, positive nitrite, positive
leukocyte esterase, more than 100 WBC, 20 to 30 RBC.  EKG
showed normal sinus rhythm, T wave inversions in leads 2, 3
and aVF and development of progressive Q waves in leads 2, 3
and aVF.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization which showed right atrial pressure of 19,
pulmonary artery pressure of 51/30, pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure (PCWP) of 27, cardiac output of 4.6, cardiac index
of 2.0.  Patient showed left dominant system and one vessel
disease with totally occluded mid-circumflex just after large
obtuse marginal.  Patient's left sided PDA filled via left to
left collaterals.  PTCA and stenting were done with no
residual stenosis and TIMI 3 flow.  LV-gram was not performed
due to reported creatinine of 1.6 at the outside hospital.
Patient had a chest x-ray which showed bilateral opacities
consistent with pulmonary edema, no hyperinflation.

1.  Cardiovascular.  The patient is status post PTCA and
stenting of mid-circumflex, status post inferior posterior MI
[**97**] hours prior to presentation complicated by hypotension and
bradycardia, still requiring pressors during cardiac
catheterization.  Upon transfer from the cardiac
catheterization lab, aspirin, Plavix and Integrilin were
continued.  Patient was started on Lipitor.  Cardiac enzymes
were cycled q.eight hours and were followed to the peak.  It
was postulated that patient's persistent hypotension was due
to heightened vagal tone since there was no evidence of right
sided MI by cardiac catheterization.  Patient was
subsequently weaned off Neo-Synephrine and was started on ACE
inhibitor which he tolerated well.  Initially beta blockers
were held due to presumed COPD exacerbation, although patient
does not have an official diagnosis of COPD.  Patient was
given Lasix 20 mg p.o. once and showed good urinary output
response to that, since patient did appear in mild pulmonary
edema.  However, most of patient's wheezing and shortness of
breath were secondary to pulmonary etiology.  Patient has
done very well in the intensive care unit and was
subsequently transferred to the general medical floor.
Patient was started on a low dose beta blocker and tolerated
that well.  Patient is to have cardiology followup.  It was
suggested that patient could follow up with a physician at
[**Hospital1 69**], however, patient
preferred to have followup set up by his primary care
physician in his community.

2.  Pulmonary.  The patient does not have a documented
history of COPD, however, given his extensive history of
smoking and extensive wheezing and good response to
bronchodilators, patient most likely does have COPD.  Patient
was given continuous neb treatments which we were able to
change to metered dose inhalers.  Patient did receive
appropriate education about their use.  Patient would greatly
benefit from outpatient pulmonary function tests for proper
diagnosis of COPD.  Patient received excessive education on
the necessity of quitting smoking.  That was done repeatedly
during daily conversations with the patient.

3.  GI.  The patient was treated with Protonix for
prophylaxis.

4.  Renal.  The patient received Mucomyst pre-cath and
post-cath.  Patient's creatinine and electrolytes remained
stable throughout the hospitalization.

5.  ID.  The patient had E.coli UTI per records from the
outside hospital.  Patient was started on Levaquin at the
outside hospital.  Here the antibiotic was changed to Bactrim
which patient is to take for the few consecutive days during
his hospitalization.

6.  Anxiety.  The patient was continued on Xanax and Paxil.

7.  Nutrition.  The patient is to follow a cardiac, low
sodium diet.  The patient received extensive education about
the importance of adhering to this diet regimen.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Status post myocardial infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85 year old
female with a past medical history of bilateral carotid
stenosis, coronary artery disease, status post left anterior
descending percutaneous intervention, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, who was admitted to the CCU for
monitoring following elective right internal carotid artery
percutaneous intervention.  The patient has initially been
evaluated in [**7-22**], for word finding difficulty and a left
facial droop and was found to have bilateral internal carotid
artery stenosis.  The patient has a history of significant
coronary artery disease, multiple medical problems and her
age.  She was referred for elective stent intervention of her
carotids as opposed to endarterectomy.  She had a magnetic
resonance scan - MRA of head and neck on [**2186-2-22**], which
showed a two right hemispheric microhemorrhages and right
subcortical small vessel ischemic disease.  During the stent
procedure, the patient required a Neo-Synephrine drip for
decreased blood pressure and Atropine times two for decreased
heart rate.  During the procedure, the patient was noted to
have an right posterior carotid AV fistula.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Peripheral vascular disease.
2.  Carotid stenosis bilaterally, ultrasound [**2-20**], bilateral
internal carotid artery stenosis of 70 to 90%.
3.  Cerebrovascular accident with small vessel disease. Known
facial droop, right hemispheric microhemorrhages.
4.  Coronary artery disease, [**11-20**], catheterization with a
left main 20% ostial stenosis, left anterior descending 80%
midstenosis, status post stent, diagonal 90% stenosis status
post stent, left circumflex 40% lesion at the OM1.  Ejection
fraction estimated to be 67% on a MUGA, ETT MIBI, that she
had in [**12-23**].  There was no nuclear defect, perfusion
defects, during the test.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Hypercholesterolemia.
7.  Osteoporosis.
8.  Status post cataract surgery.
9.  Status post Zenker's diverticular repair.

6.  Plavix 75 mg once daily.
7.  Fosamax 70 mg q.week.
8.  Multivitamin one once daily.
9.  Lactulose.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives alone.  No tobacco use and rare
ETOH use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of presentation, she was
afebrile with a heart rate of 63, blood pressure 120/50 to
160/60, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 99% on two
liters.  She is in no acute distress lying in bed.
Extraocular movements are intact.  The pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Anicteric.
No bruit or jugular venous distention appreciated.  Heart is
regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally
posteriorly.  Abdomen with normoactive bowel sounds, soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities - no cyanosis, clubbing
or edema.  Right leg immobilizer placed.  Her dorsalis pedis
were [**1-22**].  Her neurologic examination revealed cranial nerves
with the exception of her facial nerve were intact.  She has
flat nasolabial fold on the left side.  Normal upper and
lower extremity strength.

LABORATORY DATA:  On the day of admission, white blood cell
count 6.6, hematocrit 32.6, platelet count 291,000.  Total
cholesterol was 173, HDL 45, LDL 109.

ASSESSMENT:  This is an 81 year old female with a history of
coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, carotid
artery stenosis, bilaterally, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, admitted to the CCU status post right
internal carotid artery stent.

1.  Neurology - The patient had stent, status post right
internal carotid artery stent.  She initially was on
Neo-Synephrine to maintain a blood pressure goal between 110
and 150.  She had q1hour neurological checks and then q2hour
neurological checks.  Initially, her Neo-Synephrine was
weaned off and the patient's blood pressure gradually rose to
approximately 160 to 170.  As a result, some very low dose
Nitroglycerin drip was started to try to keep her blood
pressure between 150 and 110.  The patient had hypotension
with blood pressure down to 70.  The Nitroglycerin drip was
stopped and Neo-Synephrine drip was started with blood
pressure up to as high as 200s. When all drips were stopped,
her blood pressure gradually came down to 120 to 130
systolic.  This was fairly soon after the stent had been
placed and the patient arriving in the CCU.  Overnight the
first hospital night, the patient was placed on a low dose of
Neo-Synephrine 0.1 to maintain her blood pressure between 110
to 120 with gradually being able to be weaned off the drip
and on the second hospital day, the Neo-Synephrine drip was
turned off.  The patient did not require any Atropine in the
CCU, however, she did have a symptomatic bradycardia going
down to mid 30s while she is sleeping, coming up to mid 40s
to 50s when being awakened.  On the neurologic examination,
there was no focality or any change in her examination from
her baseline which had the left nasolabial fold flattening.
However, the patient did seem to be confused the evening
status post the procedure and on day two on the [**2186-4-6**], the
patient had a CT of the head without contrast which showed no
definite hemorrhage. The results were reviewed with the
neurologist following along with the team, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1774**].  On the
second day postprocedure, the patient was acting more
oriented and less confused.  Her confusion seemed to coincide
with the onset of night fall and possible disturbance of her
sleep/wake cycle.  The rest of her stay the patient had blood
pressure near goal being consistently in the 120s to 130s.
She was transferred to the floor and Step-Down Unit on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**]
Two for further monitoring.  The patient was seen by physical
therapy who felt the patient was a fall risk and recommended
for both feet physical therapy and occupational therapy and a
short term rehabilitation to optimize her functional capacity
before returning to living alone at home.

2.  Hematology - The night after the procedure the patient
had a right arterial and venous sheath in place for her
arterial line that was monitoring her blood pressure.  The
patient, despite having a leg immobilizer and numerous
discussions and explanations and exhortations to stay in bed,
attempted to get out of bed on the first night of her
admission, and was seen by house staff.  House staff and
nursing staff got the patient into bed.  Her groin
examination was stable with no bruit or hematoma, however, on
the next day, her hematocrit dropped to 26.3.  The patient
had two units of packed red blood cells transfused with her
hematocrit being 34.9 on the day of discharge.  Her CT of her
abdomen and pelvis showed no retroperitoneal hematoma.  This
examination was done on [**2186-4-7**].

3.  Blood pressure control - The patient will be discharged
on Univasc 7.5 mg twice a day and will follow-up with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] in four to six weeks to have her blood pressure
medications adjusted possibly placing her back on her beta
blocker as well.

4.  Coronary artery disease - The patient was continued on
her Aspirin and now will be on Plavix for life long therapy.

5.  Infectious disease - The patient had a low grade
temperature maximizing at 100.5 on the day prior to
discharge.  She had urine and blood cultures sent, all of
which are no growth at the time of discharge.  As well, her
urinalysis was unremarkable.  She had no localizing symptoms
of temperature or fever. Her temperature is 100 temperature
maximum on the day of discharge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Bilateral carotid artery stenosis, status post right
internal carotid artery stenting.
2.  Significant coronary artery disease, status post left
anterior descending stenting.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Peripheral vascular disease.
6.  Mild dementia.
7.  Right facial droop seemingly due to an old stroke.

PROCEDURE:  Right internal carotid artery stent.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Univasc 7.5 mg p.o. twice a day.
2.  Artificial Tears one to two drops O.U. p.rn.
3.  Lactulose.
4.  Multivitamin.
5.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. once daily.
6.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. once daily.
7.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
8.  Fosamax 70 mg q.week.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in approximately
four weeks in follow-up appointment for this procedure and at
the same time to see her primary care physician.

Service:  CCU
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  V-fib arrest.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 19 year old
female with no past medical history found dyspneic by her
roommate in her dorm room, and subsequently syncopal.  The BU
police were called, hooked up an automated defibrillator which
advised shock.  Patient was defibrillated.  Subsequently EMT
arrived.  Patient was in complete heart block with slow escape.
She was intubated and given epinephrine times four, atropine
times three.  She subsequently became tachycardiac, again went
into ventricular fibrillation, was shocked times two and started
on lidocaine bolus and then drip.  She was then transported to
[**Hospital1 69**].  In the emergency
department patient was given 4 liters of fluid.  She was given
magnesium and charcoal, 2 gm of IV calcium.  Her workup included
a head CT which was negative.  Chest CT showed no evidence of PE.
Subsequently in the emergency department patient was becoming
progressively more hypoxic and difficult to ventilate,
requiring bagging and continuous suctioning of pink frothy
secretions.  Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema.  She became
more hypotensive as well with a nadir blood pressure in the
50s to 60s systolic requiring Neosynephrine drip with
sedation and paralysis.  She became easier to ventilate after
that.  She was then transferred to the cardiac
catheterization lab on 20 mcg per kg of Neosynephrine for PA
catheterization and intra-aortic balloon pump placement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Adderall which is
dextroamphetamine and racemic amphetamine, oral contraceptive
pills, ephedrine containing diet medication.

positive for amphetamines, otherwise negative.  ABG #1 was
7.35, 36, 250.  Patient was put on IMV with settings of 500,
14, 100% FIO2 and 5 of PEEP.  Chest x-ray showed initially
mild interstitial edema at 10:00 a.m. and at 4:10 p.m. showed
worsening CHF and interval placement of a right IJ sheath.
Head CT showed no evidence of acute bleeding or intracerebral
hemorrhage.  Chest CT showed no evidence of pulmonary
embolism, patchy bilateral opacities.  EKG taken from strips
from the EMTs showed complete heart block with slow
junctional escape, then sinus, then v-fib, after shocking
back to sinus.  EKG on arrival showed sinus tachycardia with
normal axis.  Echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis with
severely depressed LVEF.  Left atrium was normal in size.
Left ventricle mildly dilated.  Right ventricle normal in
size.  Right ventricular systolic function was somewhat
depressed, 1+ MR, no pericardial effusion.

The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab
where PA cath showed RA mean of 19, RV of 49/12, PA of 43/28,
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 30 to 31, PA sat of
57%, cardiac index of 1.7.  Patient was placed on dopamine in
the cath lab.  Neo-Synephrine was weaned off and an
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.  Left sided
catheterization showed a right dominant system with normal
coronary arteries.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 19 year old female status post
v-fib arrest now in normal sinus rhythm in cardiogenic shock
with nonischemic cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology and
arrhythmia of unclear etiology.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular.
Coronaries.  There was no evidence of ischemia during initial
evaluation and cardiac catheterization showed no evidence of
lesions in the coronary arteries.

Pump.  Initially the patient was found to be in cardiogenic
shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump and pressors
including dopamine and dobutamine with global hypokinesis and
EF estimated to be about 20% with depressed cardiac output
and cardiac index.  On [**1-9**] dopamine and dobutamine
were slowly weaned.  Repeat echocardiogram was performed
which showed no significant interval change from
echocardiogram done on admission.  Patient's cardiac output
and index remained stable off the pressors.  The intra-aortic
balloon pump was discontinued on [**2131-1-10**].
Pressures continued to be consistently with mean arterial
pressures greater than 70.  Patient was gradually diuresed
with IV Lasix and over the course of the next three days
achieved a euvolemic volume status.

Rhythm.  The patient was started on an IV amiodarone drip as
prophylaxis against further episodes of ventricular
fibrillation.  After two days there were no episodes of
significant ectopy and amiodarone was discontinued and then
changed to p.o. amiodarone.  From [**1-11**] onward patient
was no longer having episodes of hypotension, no longer
requiring pressors and no longer needed arterial line or PA
catheter monitoring and these were discontinued.  At this
time it is still unclear what the etiology of the
cardiomyopathy is.  Possibilities include viral myocarditis
as well as the possibility of drug (ephedrine) induced myopathy.

2.  Pulmonary.  The patient was initially intubated for
hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to cardiac arrest.  Was
maintained on a propofol drip for adequate sedation while
intubated as patient was often fighting the vent when off
sedation.  Settings were kept on assist control with several
episodes of acute desaturation whenever patient was moved.
The pulmonary service was consulted and recommended
decreasing the tidal volume as well as the FIO2 as well as
further diuresis, all of which were done.  By [**1-12**]
FIO2 had been weaned down to 40% and assist control was
changed over to pressure support of 15 and PEEP of 7.5 with
continued adequate oxygenation as well as ventilation.
Sedation was gradually titrated down and patient continued to
have adequate tidal volumes on pressure support.  Chest x-ray
on [**2131-1-12**], showed evidence of left lower lobe
opacity consistent with atelectasis.  Post suctioning and
repositioning as well as aggressive chest P.T., these chest
x-ray findings resolved and there were no further episodes of
desaturation.  From the pulmonary edema standpoint patient
was started on captopril for afterload reduction which she
tolerated well and captopril was increased gradually to 37.5
mg p.o. t.i.d.  She continued to have adequate oxygenation
and ventilation and no further evidence of pulmonary edema.
On [**1-16**] she began to develop increasing stridor as
well as copious secretions which were becoming more profound.
Pulmonary consult recommended a tracheostomy which was
performed on [**2131-1-16**], by interventional
pulmonology.  After tracheostomy placement, trials of mask
ventilation through the tracheostomy allowed adequate tidal
volumes as well as oxygenation and ventilation with SIMV as
backup at night.

3.  Infectious disease.  On initial presentation to the
cardiac intensive care unit patient was noted to have a fever
of 102.8.  Blood cultures were sent as well as chest x-ray
and urinalysis, none of which grew any bacteria.  There was
no evidence of infiltrates and no evidence of a urinary
infection.  Antibiotics were started with vancomycin,
levofloxacin and Flagyl for broad spectrum coverage for
possible seeding from line placement in the emergency
department.  Patient continued to be febrile for several
days, then running a low grade temperature of about 100 to
100.4 throughout her hospital stay with no further spiking
fever.  Antibiotics were discontinued on day seven.  There
was no further evidence of bacterial infection with negative
blood cultures on repeated occasions as well as negative
urinalysis.  Patient was noted to have some conjunctivitis on
the second day of her hospital stay.  Viral cultures were
sent from swabs from the eye and showed no evidence of any
viral growth.

4.  Neuro.  The patient suffered a significant amount of
hypoperfusion and anoxic brain injury due to the cardiac arrest.
For the first four days she was on propofol sedation and
neurological status was somewhat difficult to assess.  However,
after propofol was discontinued, there was very little evidence
of purposeful movement, very little withdrawal to pain and
patient was not able to follow commands consistently.  At times
she was noted to have dilated pupils and gaze deviation which
resolved on their own.  EEG was performed, the results of which
seemed consistent with medication related effect versus toxic
metabolic injury.  There was no evidence of seizure activity.
MRI showed diffuse anoxic brain injury with multiple areas of
cortical white matter infarcts.  Head CT showed no evidence
of edema.  However, on funduscopic exam there was some
evidence of papilledema.  The head of the bed was elevated,
but given the mildness of the increased intracranial pressure
there was no indication for using diuresis with mannitol or
administration of steroids.  Neurology service was consulted
and felt that the overall prognosis for recovery was minimal
given the findings on MRI as well as the prognosis post
cardiac arrest with 93% chance for permanent disability with
only about 7% chance of any significant functional improvement.
These findings were conveyed to the family who still are
maintaining hopes of eventual recovery.

5.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition.  The patient was
initially started on tube feeds as well as Reglan for
promotility and Colace and senna for a bowel regimen.  On
[**2131-1-19**], patient underwent percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy placement by the gastroenterology service without
complications.  This will be used for further tube feedings.

6.  Access.  Initially the patient had a right internal
jugular Cordis for central access.  This was then resited to
a left internal jugular Cordis on [**1-10**].  Central
access was then discontinued on [**2131-1-13**], as there
was no further need for any central access medications or
monitoring.  Arterial line placed on [**2131-1-8**], was
continued until [**2131-1-12**], when A-line monitoring was
no longer needed.  On [**2131-1-18**], a peripherally
inserted central catheter was placed for long term access.

Further hospital course to be dictated at a later date.

ADDENDUM:  This is an addendum to an initial Discharge
Summary which was dictated on [**2127-2-6**].

While awaiting rehabilitation bed placement, Psychiatry saw
the patient for management of anxiety attacks and sleep
depravation.  Their impression was that the nightly episodes
of sleep depravation were most likely related to an anxiety
disorder secondary to her respiratory problems and a delirium
which might be caused by the presence of infection, hypoxia,
or metabolic.  Their recommendations were to start Seroquel
12.5 mg p.o. q.h.s.  which should help for the depression,
and anxiety, and sleep.  Continue to treating her medical
problems.

The patient did not want to initiate medications at this
time.

Note:  This is an addendum to the discharge summary which was
dictated on [**1-16**], covering [**1-16**] through
[**1-18**], the day of discharge.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**1-16**], on postoperative day #37,
which was day 17 of a 19 day course of Vancomycin, the
patient's T-max was 99.3??????, blood pressure 114/44, oxygen
saturation 100%, in sinus rhythm in the 70s.  The patient
remained on CPAP with pressure support at 40%, white count
9.8, hematocrit 30.  The patient was alert.  Heart was
regular, rate and rhythm.  The patient had slightly coarse
breath sounds.  Abdomen was soft.

The patient continued to have trach trials and a swallowing
study to determine where should would be for her
rehabilitation placement.  She continued on Vancomycin as we
awaited a bed.

She was seen again on the 12th by the [**Hospital **] Clinic.  The
[**Hospital **] Clinic did a consult again on [**1-16**] to
reevaluate the Insulin protocol that the patient was using.
They recommended a new protocol for the patient with changing
to Humalog.  They recommended that the patient follow-up with
[**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient.

The patient was also seen by cardiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] who
noted that she was stable over night, maintaining good blood
pressure and normal sinus rhythm at 80.  Her swallow study
was successful.  The plan was made to continue with her
ventilatory care and continue her beta-blocker, ACE
inhibitor, and await the rehabilitation bed.

On on postoperative day #38, the patient on the trach
ventilator all night.  She did pass her swallowing study.
Her breath sounds continued to clear a bit.  Her incision was
healed.  Her trach site was intact.  She appeared to be doing
well.  She continued on her Plavix and Aspirin, as well as
Lopressor and day 18 of 19 of her Vancomycin.  She also
continued to be covered by the sliding scale Insulin, subcue
Heparin, in addition to her Captopril and her Insulin
protocol [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **].  They saw her again on the 13th.

She continued to be seen by Physical Therapy and Case
Management again on the 13th.  She was accepted at [**Hospital1 5593**].  The patient was transferred over for need of
CSRU bed to the SICU on the 13th.  Please refer to the
transfer note.

Her PICC line and arterial line had been discontinued at that
point, she only had peripheral IVs.  She continued on oxygen
via ............... in the morning with additional support in
the evening.

On [**1-18**], the day of discharge, the patient completed
19 of 19 days of Vancomycin therapy.  She was rested over
night.  Her discharge labs consisted of a sodium of 138,
potassium 4.7, chloride 103, CO2 26, BUN 42, creatinine 1.2.
Her chest film showed improved aeration.  She had a T-max of
100.2??????, blood pressure 120/49, oxygen saturation 96% on 2 L.
Heart was regular, rate and rhythm.  Breath sounds were
coarse.  Her belly was soft.  Her extremities were warm and
well perfused.

The plan was to continue her tracheostomy trial and
ventilatory weaning at the rehabilitation facility.  The
patient was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2127-1-18**].

ADDENDUM:  Please note that this is an Addendum to the
Discharge Summary dictated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who had
summarized the hospital course up to and including through
[**2127-2-14**].  Please see his Discharge Summary for
details of the hospital course.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient was transferred to
the Medicine Service from the Vascular Surgery Service for
diuresis and management of her congestive heart failure.  The
patient was started on Bumex and responded well to that and
was diuresing over one liter negative every day.

On the day of discharge, it was decided that the patient
would be sent back to the Community Hospital where she
initially presented from on Bumex 2 mg p.o. q.d.

2.  PULMONARY SYSTEM:  The patient's tracheostomy was removed
on [**2127-2-18**].  The patient tolerated the procedure
well and without complications, and the patient was also able
to maintain good oxygen saturations.

3.  GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM:  The patient's percutaneous
cholecystectomy tube was removed on [**2127-2-17**] without
any complications.

The patient was also found to have elevated
glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase which were all
isolated, as all of her other transaminases were found to be
normal.  At that time it was decided with they attending that
an ultrasound should be obtained.  An ultrasound was done
that showed normal architecture with multiple small
gallstones.  No gallbladder distention or dilatations, and no
signs of any obstruction.  There were multiple hyperechoic
lesions which could likely represent hemangioma (as per the
radiology read).

At the time of this dictation the Gastroenterology team was
also consulted, but they had not seen the patient yet.  The
patient was completely asymptomatic, so this may require
further followup in the outside Community Hospital.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  NPH 38 units subcutaneously q.a.m.
 2.  NPH 12 units subcutaneously q.p.m.
 3.  Losartan 25 mg p.o. q.d.
 4.  Diamox 250 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 5.  Bumex 2 mg p.o. q.d.
 6.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. for two more days; then
amiodarone 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. for seven days; then amiodarone
200 mg p.o. q.d. ongoing.
 7.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 8.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously b.i.d.
 9.  Timolol maleate 0.25% one drop left eye b.i.d.
10.  Epogen 20,000 units subcutaneously every Friday.
11.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
12.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
13.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. as needed.
14.  Guaifenesin 5 mg to 10 mg p.o. q.4-6h. as needed.
15.  Atrovent 1 to 2 puffs inhaled q.4-6h. as needed.
16.  Seroquel 25 mg p.o. q.h.s.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was stable at the time
of discharge.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was to be discharged back to
the Community Hospital.  The attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], has
already talked to her primary care physician who has accepted
her back to the Community Hospital.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:   The patient was to be seen
by her primary care physician in the outside Community
Hospital.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Discoloration and coolness of the left
foot.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was initially seen
in the Emergency Room.  She had recently been discharged from
rehab after a long postoperative course after undergoing
coronary artery bypass graft requiring a tracheostomy.  She
now presents with a left foot that is cold and painful over
the last 24 hours.  She is now admitted for further
evaluation and treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, type 1
diabetes with triopathy, chronic renal insufficiency baseline
creatinine 2.0, peripheral vascular disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery bypass graft surgery
with saphenous vein graft to the right posterolateral
coronary, the obtuse marginal one in the left anterior
descending [**2126-12-10**].  Percutaneous tracheostomy with tube
placement and flexible sigmoidoscopy with aspiration of
tracheal broncho tree on [**2127-1-13**].  Cardiac catheterization on
[**2126-12-7**] demonstrated right coronary artery dominant system
with severe three vessel disease, left main trunk had 30%
stenosis at the ostium.  The left anterior descending
coronary artery had diffuse disease with a mid 80% stenosis.
The diagonal one was occluded.  The left circumflex main was
occluded.  The right coronary artery had a mid 40% lesion
with diffuse disease into the posterior descending coronary
artery with an 89% stenosis of right coronary artery and
distal posterior descending coronary artery.  Resting
measurements revealed pulmonary wedge pressure of 20, cardiac
index of 1.7. An attempt was made to try to stent the left
circumflex origin, but this was aborted.  Echocardiogram done
on [**2127-1-13**] demonstrated left ventricular ejection fraction of
30% with severe inferior posterior hypokinesis and akinesis.
He is status post right femoral popliteal bypass graft.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Percocet tablets, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Plavix

max was 98.7, 123/50, 93, 24, and 90% with a face mask.
Chest examination lungs showed coarse breath sounds
bilaterally.  The heart was a regular rate and rhythm.  The
abdominal examination was soft, nondistended, nontender.
Cholecystostomy tube was in place.  Rectal examination was
guaiac negative.  No masses.  Peripheral vascular disease
pulses femorals palpable bilaterally.  The left popliteal was
biphasic signal.  The right popliteal was absent.  The
dorsalis pedis pulse on the right was biphasic.  The
posterior tibial pulse on the right was biphasic signals
only.  The dorsalis pedis pulse on the right was palpable and
absent posterior tibial pulse.  The right graft was palpable.

sensation.

LABORATORIES IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM:  White blood cell count
of 4.3, hematocrit of 30.6, BUN 66, creatinine 1.6, K 5.0,
PT/INR were normal.  Electrocardiogram was without ischemic
changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was seen by the Vascular
Service.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] followed the patient for cardiac care.
[**Last Name (un) **] was involved regarding diabetic management.  Initial
arteriogram planed for [**1-27**] was deferred secondary to the
patient's elevated BUN of 2.7.  Her Lasix was held and serial
creatinines were obtained.  Renal was consulted regarding her
acute renal failure.  Recommendations they felt this was
secondary to hypovolemia both to poor oral intake and
diuretic use.  Intravenous fluids were instituted.  Her [**Last Name (un) **]
and ace inhibitors were held and diuretics were held and her
beta blockers were held for a systolic blood pressure less
then 100.  Because of the patient's renal status she
underwent a bilateral MRA run off.  The abdominal MRA showed
a mild and distal abdominal aorta appears to be within normal
limits.  There is no significant stenosis.  The proximal
celiac trunk or the proximal superior mesenteric artery with
a single right renal arteries bilaterally.  On the right the
run off showed good in flow without significant stenosis of
the common iliac, external iliac, femorals, superficial
femoral artery and popliteals.  A three vessel run off was
identified with poor quality proximal AT and posterior tibial
peroneal arteries.  There were multiple foci of moderate
stenosis identified in the proximal half of each of the three
vessels.  Anterior tibial and posterior tibial occluded at
the level of the mid calf and the peroneal occludes in the
distal one third of the calf.  Bypass graft was identified
extending to below the popliteal artery with a good
anastomosis.  There is good flow identified within the
dorsalis pedis artery.  The bypass graft was patent.  On the
left side there was no in flow disease.  There is three
vessel run off.  The anterior tibial provides flow to the
dorsalis pedis pulse.  There are multiple areas of mild to
moderate stenosis along the AT length.  The dorsalis pedis
pulse is diseased, but of good caliber.  Posterior tibial
occludes at the distal one third of the calf, collateral
vessels are identified in the medial calf extending to the
level of the ankle, which reconstitutes at the plantar arch.
The peroneal occludes in the distal one third.

With intravenous hydration and holding her diuretics and ace
an ABRs the creatinine showed a significant improvement and
over the next 48 hours she returned to baseline.  The patient
developed a total white blood cell count of 32.3.  The
patient had blood urine sputum cultures obtained all which
were negative.  The chest x-ray showed bilateral lower lobe
consolidation/collapse with worsening left sided pleural
effusion.  White blood cell count over the next several days
improved after aggressive pulmonary care.  Her white blood
cell count on [**2-4**] was 17.9, hematocrit 30.9, platelets
392K, BUN 90, creatinine 1.7, K 4.6.  The patient underwent a
left leg arteriogram on [**2127-2-3**], which demonstrated patent
BK popliteal, diseased AT at the origin, tibial peroneal
trunk was diseased.  There was a patent AT through the calf
with diffuse disease distally.  The posterior tibial and
peroneal were occluded with reconstruction of the dorsalis
pedis at the foot that is patent and two tarsal branches in
the forefoot with incomplete arch.

Post angiogram the patient's renal function remained stable
without an increase in her creatinine.  It was determined
that surgery would be deferred until the patient's
nutritional renal status were more stabilized.  She will be
transferred to rehab for continued care and with follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] in two weeks.  On discharge her white blood
cell count was 21.3, hematocrit 30.9, platelets 430K, sodium
144, potassium 5.2, chloride 109, CO2 23, BUN 88, creatinine
1.8.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This a 59 year old female with
diabetes mellitus and known coronary artery disease who was
cathed in [**Month (only) 547**] at [**Hospital6 **].  Cath at that time
showed severe three vessel coronary artery disease, but
patient was elected to be treated medically due to poor
targets.  Since her cardiac catheterization she had two
episodes of heart failure and presented to [**Hospital1 346**] emergency department on [**2126-12-7**], with an acute MI.  Cardiac catheterization was
performed on [**2126-12-7**], the day of admission, which
revealed left main coronary artery disease with 30% stenosis,
diffuse disease of the left anterior descending with 80%
midocclusion.  Left circumflex was occluded.  Mid-right
coronary artery with 40% stenosis and diffuse disease in the
posterior descending artery.  An intra-aortic balloon pump
was placed at that time.  Patient was referred to the cardiac
surgery service for coronary artery bypass grafting.  Patient
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times three on
[**2126-12-10**].  Saphenous vein graft to distal left
anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal,
saphenous vein graft to right posterolateral.  Total
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 113 minutes.  Total clamp
time was 59 minutes.  Patient was transferred in normal sinus
rhythm at 82 beats per minute, hemodynamically stable, to the
cardiac surgery recovery unit on 0.3 mcg per kg per minute of
milrinone, 1.2 mcg per kg per minute of Neo-Synephrine, 10
mcg per kg per minute of propofol and an insulin drip at 2
units per hour.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery
disease; type 1 diabetes mellitus complicated by diabetic
retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy and diabetic neuropathy;
chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 2.0;

count 106.  Sodium 139, potassium 5.2, BUN 46, creatinine
1.2, glucose 201.  Magnesium 2.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was extubated on [**2126-12-11**], which was postoperative day one.  On postoperative day
one patient had a low grade temperature of 100.8 with t-max
of 101.7, with an intra-aortic balloon pump still at 1:1, on
Neo-Synephrine at 3.5, off milrinone.  Physical exam benign.
Plan was to wean Neo-Synephrine and wean the balloon pump.

On postoperative day two patient still with low grade
temperature of 100.2 and t-max of 101.7.  Still on
Neo-Synephrine at 0.9.  Intra-aortic balloon pump at 1:2.
White count 9.8, hematocrit 24.5, platelet count 80.  Sodium
139, potassium 4.7, BUN 47, creatinine 1.4, glucose 130.
Physical exam still remained benign.  Patient was awake and
alert with good cardiac index with the intra-aortic balloon
pump at 1:2.  Plan was to change the balloon pump to 1:3 in
the morning and to possibly discontinue the intra-aortic
balloon pump and subsequently wean Neo-Synephrine.  Plan was
also to transfuse one unit for hematocrit of 24.5.

On postoperative day three patient was afebrile, however,
t-max of 101.3 which was at 6:00 o'clock p.m.  Patient was
still on milrinone and Neo-Synephrine with an index of 2.05,
making good urine.  Chest tube was putting out minimal
amount.  White count 14.1, hematocrit 28, platelet count 79.
Sodium 137, potassium 4.5, BUN 53, creatinine 1.7.  Physical
exam remained benign.  Over the last 24 hours patient was in
and out of a-fib and a-flutter throughout the night for which
she was placed on amiodarone.  Currently in atrial
fibrillation at 77 beats per minute.  Cardiology came by to
see patient for atrial fibrillation.  They recommended to
possibly taper off milrinone which may be exacerbating the
situation.  They also recommended oral amiodarone versus IV
amiodarone and to transfuse patient for low hematocrit.

On postoperative day four patient now in normal sinus rhythm,
however, with decreased urine output, on dobutamine at 4.5,
Neo-Synephrine at 1.4, amiodarone and insulin.  Afebrile.
Normal sinus rhythm at 88 beats per minute.  Otherwise vital
signs stable.  White count 14.2, hematocrit 32, platelet
count 117.  Creatinine up from 1.7 to 1.9 with BUN of 55.  On
physical exam patient had decreased breath sounds at both
bases with 1+ edema of the lower extremities.  Patient was
alert with no deficits.

On postoperative day five patient still on dobutamine at 2.5,
insulin, milrinone at 0.5, Neo-Synephrine at 0.25.  Twenty
four events included an episode of pulmonary edema.  Patient
afebrile in normal sinus rhythm at 99 beats per minute.
Vital signs otherwise stable.  White count 14.4, hematocrit
28.1, platelet count 125.  Creatinine increasing from 1.9 to
2.1.  On physical exam lungs had coarse breath sounds
bilaterally with bibasilar crackles.  Patient with adequate
urine output after administering Lasix three times.  Patient
was also noted to be confused, requiring frequent
reorientation.  Heart failure team came by to see patient at
which time they recommended that if blood pressure decreases
or mean arterial pressure decreases to less than 60, they
would add vasopressin.  They also recommended Zaroxolyn 2.5
mg p.o. times one, to start a Lasix drip and can increase up
to 20 mg drip per hour.  If Lasix does not work, to change to
Bumex 2 mg IV b.i.d., increasing up to 4 mg IV b.i.d.  To
also increase milrinone to 0.6 if MAO2 is in the 50s.

Renal came by and saw patient on [**12-16**] at which time
they recommended sending urine sodium, creatinine, urea and
protein to assess pre-renal and ATN parameters.  They also
recommended a renal ultrasound to determine the etiology of
the underlying renal disease.  They also planned to initiate
CVVHD given the significant CHF necessitating 100%
nonrebreather with poor response to diuretics.  They also
said that we could discontinue the Lasix drip.

On postoperative day six patient afebrile in normal sinus
rhythm, alert and awake with increasing white count from 14.4
to 19.4, hematocrit stable at 31.  Creatinine was 2.3.
Physical exam unchanged aside from 2+ pitting edema in all
extremities.  Patient now on CVVH for fluid overload and
renal insufficiency.  On milrinone, amiodarone with cardiac
index of 2.74, now making urine so Lasix was discontinued.
Patient was reintubated on [**12-16**] at the request of the
SSCU staff for respiratory failure.

On postoperative day seven patient still afebrile in normal
sinus rhythm at 94, intubated on SIMV and pressure support
500 and 12 breathing 5 above the vent 80% FIO2 with adequate
urine output.  White count coming down from 19.4 to 14.5 with
stable hematocrit.  Creatinine was 2.2.  Extremities will
less edema.  Otherwise exam unchanged.  Plan is to continue
with CVVH and to continue amiodarone and milrinone.  Renal
came by and saw patient on [**12-17**] at which time they
recommended to continue patient on milrinone to optimize
cardiac function.  To continue CVVH.  They also recommended
to recheck sodium in the afternoon for patient's
hyponatremia.  If still low, to consider changing replacement
fluids to normal saline.  To continue anticoagulation with
heparin 500 units per hour with a goal PTT of 50 to 80.

On postoperative day eight patient with low grade temperature
of 99.9, still intubated with rising white count to 17.5,
stable hematocrit.  Creatinine was 1.8.  On physical exam
patient was intubated and sedated with coarse upper airway
noise and decreased edema in the lower extremities.  Plan was
to begin weaning milrinone.  To continue CVVH.

On postoperative day nine 24 hour events included CVVH being
clotted.  Patient afebrile with cardiac index of 2.2, in
sinus rhythm at 78, good urine output, still intubated and
sedated with minimal lower extremity edema.  Plan was to try
to attempt to wake up patient and to attempt extubation.  To
continue milrinone, Neo-Synephrine and Pitressin.  The heart
failure team came by again at which time they recommended to
continue present pressor support and to check lactate and to
continue CVVHD.  Renal came by and saw patient and restarted
CVVH which was clotted overnight.  Restarted it at 9:00 a.m.
On [**12-19**] patient underwent placement of a right
subclavian Cordis and Swan-Ganz.

On postoperative day 10 patient on vancomycin and levo as
well as vasopressin, Neo-Synephrine, milrinone and insulin.
Afebrile, in sinus rhythm at 65.  Still intubated and
sedated.  On physical exam the left foot appeared more
mottled than normal and cool with a faintly dopplerable DP
pulse and palpable pulse on the right DP.  Plan was to
attempt to wean Pitressin and try to extubate.  Continue
CVVH.  To continue levo for patient's upper respiratory tract
infection, as patient grew out Neisseria in sputum, and
vancomycin for an infected right IJ site.  Extubation was
attempted on the 15th, however, anesthesia was called to
reintubate patient for respiratory failure after extubation
trial.

On postoperative day 11 patient still on vanco and levo as
well as vasopressin, milrinone, insulin, Neo-Synephrine.
Afebrile, in normal sinus rhythm at 82, intubated, on CVVHD
with creatinine of 1.5 and white count of 14.6 and stable
hematocrit of 27.5.  On physical exam the neck was very
erythematous with purulent right IJ site.

On postoperative day 12 still on the same drips.  Twenty four
events included increasing CVVH to 100 per hour.  Patient was
afebrile with stable output and index.  Still intubated with
decreased white blood cell count of 11.7, stable hematocrit
and creatinine of 1.5.  On physical exam left toe was mottled
and cold, otherwise unchanged.

On postoperative day 13, 24 hour events included CVVH being
clotted overnight.  Patient still on the same drips with an
index of 2.0 and CVP of 14.  Still intubated.  Physical exam
remained unchanged.  White count down to 10.7, hematocrit
stable with creatinine of 1.5.  Plan was to continue to watch
hematocrit.  Patient was transfused one unit of packed red
blood cells bringing hematocrit up to 27.  Plan was also to
put patient on Nepro tube feeds.  Renal evaluated patient on
[**12-23**] at which time they recommended sending a
urinalysis for patient's hematuria and for patient's
metabolic acidosis which was improved after antibiotics.
They wanted us to follow patient's ABGs and to continue to
transfuse red blood cells, increase intravascular volume with
a goal of 1 to 2 liters negative a day.  That same day a left
femoral central venous Quinton catheter was placed with CVVH
flow now being excellent through this new catheter since
there was a clot in the IJ catheter.  Renal recommended
keeping PTT at 60 to 80, however, closer to 80 to avoid
clotting again.

On postoperative day 14 patient on day six of vanco and levo.
Still on milrinone, Neo-Synephrine, Pitressin, propofol,
still intubated and sedated with a rising white count of
13.3, stable hematocrit of 29.9, creatinine of 1.4.  Physical
exam remained unchanged.  Plan was to continue tube feeds.
Patient was v-paced overnight due to slow junctional rhythm.
Possible discontinuation of patient's amiodarone.  Continue
vanco and levo for Enterobacter and E.coli which grew out of
the cultures.  To continue to watch patient's hematocrit.

On postoperative day 15 patient in normal sinus rhythm,
afebrile, still intubated and sedated with stable white count
and hematocrit.  Slightly hyponatremic at 131 with BUN of 27,
creatinine of 1.3.  Physical exam unchanged.  Plan was to
continue levofloxacin for the URI and the Enterobacter in
blood and sputum.  Renal came by and saw patient at which
time they noted that patient responded to 40 mg IV of Lasix
with a decreased Neo-Synephrine drip today.  They recommended
adding Lasix IV q.d. and b.i.d. and to decrease the amount
removed by CVVH to transition her off CVVH.  They recommended
increasing intravascular volume and keeping hematocrit
greater than 30.

On postoperative day 16 patient with low grade temperature of
99.5, still in sinus rhythm at 78.  Stable white count of
12.1 with hematocrit of 27.  BUN and creatinine stable.
Physical exam unchanged.  On milrinone and Pitressin with
good cardiac index.  Plan was to have a trial off CVVH today
and to increase Lasix to increase patient's urine output.
Plan was also to transfuse one unit of packed red blood cells
and to continue levofloxacin.  Renal again saw patient on
[**12-26**] at which time they recommended to discontinue
heparin and to discontinue CVVH machine.  To administer
patient 40 to 60 mg IV of Lasix b.i.d. to keep patient even
and to continue with blood transfusion.

On postoperative day 17 patient with low grade temperature of
100.6, in sinus rhythm at 79.  Still intubated, opening eyes.
Physical exam remained unchanged.  White count of 13.8,

temperature of 100.4, in sinus rhythm at 95, index of 3.29.
White count increasing to 15.2 with stable hematocrit of
31.8.  BUN 43, creatinine 1.6.  On milrinone and propofol
now.  Physical exam remained unchanged.  Patient still
intubated and following commands.  Plan was to possibly wean
milrinone and check the mixed venous.  Continue Lasix.
Patient still with good urine output.  Plan was to also pull
the Quinton catheter because of patient's rising white count
and low grade temperature.

On postoperative day 19, day 11 of levofloxacin, with a low
grade temperature of 100.8 and t-max of 102, in sinus rhythm
at 89, now just on insulin and propofol with an index of
2.81.  Still intubated, following commands, in no apparent
distress with a rising white count of 19.7 and stable
hematocrit of 32.4.  Physical exam remained unchanged.  Plan
was to check blood cultures, urine cultures, stool cultures,
chest x-ray and to pull the Swan and the left subclavian line
due to patient's spike in temperature.

On postoperative day 20, day 12 of levofloxacin, with low
grade temperature of 99.7, t-max of 101.3, in sinus rhythm at
99 with rising white count now at 24.4, stable hematocrit

of restarted vancomycin, with t-max of 102, t-current of
99.3, in sinus rhythm at 84.  Still intubated, however, awake
and alert.  Physical exam remained unchanged.  White count
down to 17.7, hematocrit stable.  BUN 68, creatinine rising
at 2.2.  Plan was to try to extubate patient and to continue
Promote tube feeds.  Patient had adequate urine output.  Plan
was to continue to check creatinine.  ID recommended adding
fluconazole.  Thoracic surgery came by to consult patient to
evaluate the airway.  They stated that patient had no
symptomatic edema and they stated that we would perform a
T-piece trial to rest patient overnight with the possibility
of extubating patient in the morning.  The following morning
there was an excellent cuff fit.  Patient went 1 1/2 hours on
T-piece trial yesterday and extubated without problems on
[**2127-1-1**].

On postoperative day 22, day 14 of levofloxacin, day three of
vancomycin, day two of fluconazole, patient with low grade
temperature of 99.5, currently afebrile, in sinus rhythm at
75.  Awake and alert, answering questions.  White count 15.1,
stable hematocrit.  BUN was 79, creatinine 2.1.  Physical
exam remained unchanged.

On postoperative day 23 patient afebrile, in sinus rhythm at
87.  White count down to 13.4, hematocrit stable.  BUN 72,
creatinine 1.7.  Plan was to start patient on p.o. diet and
to possibly discontinue Lasix and to continue current
antibiotic regimen.

On postoperative day 24, day 16 of levofloxacin, day five of
vancomycin, day four of fluconazole, in normal sinus rhythm
at 82, afebrile.  White count 12.8, hematocrit 27.7.  BUN 76,
creatinine 1.7.  Physical exam remained unchanged.  Plan was
to have a Jocelin consult for patient's diabetes management.
Jocelin came by to see patient at which time they recommended
patient to follow up at Jocelin for diabetic care.  Jocelin
had an extensive discussion with patient's husband and
patient.  They arrived at the decision to change to glargine
and Humalog.

On postoperative day 25 patient now on day six of vancomycin,
in sinus rhythm at 93, afebrile with white count of 12.6,
stable hematocrit.  BUN 69, creatinine 1.8.  Resting
comfortably.  Physical exam benign.  Plan was to continue
vancomycin for two weeks.  Jocelin came by to see patient
again at which time they recommended continuing IV insulin
and adjust the rate from now until pre-supper and then before
supper to check blood glucose and to give the sliding scale
of Humalog.  To increase Lantus to 20 units q.h.s.  To use
the new Humalog scale.

On postoperative day 26 patient on vancomycin.
Hemodynamically stable.  Physical exam unchanged.  Patient
now on fluconazole three out of five days.

On postoperative day 27 patient on day seven of 14 of
vancomycin and day four of five of fluconazole.  Patient
afebrile.  Sinus tach at 101.  Physical exam remained benign
with stable hematocrit and stable white count.  Jocelin came
by and saw patient again on [**1-5**] at which time they
recommended to continue Lantus at 25 units q.h.s.  To check
3:00 o'clock finger stick blood glucose.  To be on guard for
lows.  To increase pre-meal Humalog sliding scale and to
watch BUN and creatinine closely with start of ACE inhibitor
post MI.  Hem/onc came by and saw patient on [**1-6**] at
which time they felt that patient's condition was most
consistent with reactive thrombocytosis which may also be due
to iron deficiency, although the rather abrupt onset of the
rise in the platelet count was not consistent with that.
They thought that since these are normal platelets, the risk
of thrombosis is very low and is not a concern until the
platelet count exceeds 1,000,000.  They also felt that one
issue is that in those patients with platelet counts this
high, which is over 400,000, serum potassium level may be
falsely elevated.  Therefore if serum potassium came back
elevated, they would recommend that this be followed up with
plasma potassium before treating.  They said they would
continue to follow patient during her hospitalization.

On postoperative day 28, on day eight of 14 of vancomycin and
day five of five of fluconazole, 24 events included atrial
fibrillation versus atrial tachycardia overnight.  Started on
Lopressor.  With a low grade temperature of 100.  Physical
exam remained unchanged.  White count 12.7, stable
hematocrit.  BUN 40, creatinine 1.3.  Plan was to continue
Lopressor and to consider restarting amiodarone.  To continue
antibiotics.

On postoperative day 29, [**1-8**], anesthesia was called to
see patient to reintubate patient for respiratory distress
and confusion.  Patient was reintubated without
complications.  Pulmonary came by to see patient for the
reintubation at which time they recommended to continue pip,
tazo and vanco, to obtain sputum for gram stain and culture,
to obtain chest CT angio as planned.  To cycle cardiac
enzymes and repeat EKG.  To repeat a surface echo and when
extubated to obtain a speech and swallow evaluation for
aspiration risk.  CT angio of the chest was reviewed.  There
was no clear consolidation.  There was a large pleural
effusion, right greater than left and a tiny PE noted.  The
assessment leaned more toward decompensation and CHF.
Additional recommendations by pulmonary included treating for
CHF and checking daily weights.  A therapeutic thoracentesis
and to send the fluid for pH, LDH, protein, cell count with
diff and culture.

On postoperative day 30, 24 hour events included transfusion
of two units of packed red blood cells.  CT of the chest and
abdomen.  Intubation for CHF.  Panculturing.  Pulmonary and
general surgery consults.  Patient afebrile, in normal sinus
rhythm at 70.  Still intubated, sedated, but arousable.
Physical exam remained unchanged.  White count 17.7, stable
hematocrit 34.1.  Plan was to drain the pleural effusion
today and to try to work toward extubating patient.  GI to do
percutaneous cholecystostomy today and to start tube feeds
once stable.  To follow up BUN and creatinine after dye load.
To continue vanco and Zosyn.  General surgery came by to see
patient on [**1-9**] at which time they stated that they
could not rule out calculus cholecystitis.  They recommended
to drain the gallbladder with a catheter through the liver.
A cholecystostomy tube 8 French was inserted under ultrasound
guidance on [**1-9**] and approximately 60 cc of thin bile
was aspirated.  It was sent for culture and sensitivity.  The
plan was to leave this in for six weeks even if it stopped
draining.  Pulmonary came by to see patient again on [**1-9**] at which time they recommended to decrease FIO2 to 40%.  To
perform thoracentesis of the right sided effusion.  To send
pleural fluid for LDH, protein, cell count and culture.  To
check troponin and CK.

On postoperative day 31, day 11 of 14 of vancomycin and day
three of Zosyn, 24 hour events included percutaneous
cholecystostomy, PICC being removed, bilateral pleural
effusion drainage, right draining 600, left draining 350.
Propofol drip.  White count down to 15.7, stable hematocrit.
BUN 30, creatinine 1.5.  Physical exam remained unchanged.

On postoperative day 32 physical exam remained unchanged.
White count down to 11.5, hematocrit stable.  Creatinine up
to 1.8.  Plan was to restart the standing Lasix, continue
Lopressor and to possibly extubate patient today with the
possibility of trach placement.

On postoperative day 33, day 13 of 14 on vancomycin, day four
of Zosyn, patient with low grade temperature of 99.6, still
intubated, however, comfortable.  Physical exam unchanged.
White count and platelet count and hematocrit unchanged.  BUN
42, creatinine 1.9.  Plan was to possibly perform a trach
tomorrow and to possibly discontinue the chest tubes.  Due to
the rising white blood cell count and low grade temperature,
to possibly panculture patient again.

On postoperative day 34, day 14 of 19 of vancomycin and day
six of Zosyn with a low grade temperature of 100.4.  Plan was
to trach patient today.  On [**1-13**] patient underwent
percutaneous tracheostomy without complications.

On postoperative day 36 patient's condition remained
unchanged.  NPH of 10 b.i.d. was started.  Stable hematocrit
and white count.  BUN 43, creatinine 1.5.  Speech and swallow
came by and saw patient on the 11th at which time they stated
that patient is not a good candidate for a video swallow
study to rule out aspiration because patient presents without
overt signs and symptoms of aspiration at the bedside.
Recommendations were to limit the wear schedule of the
Passy-Muir valve to every four hours for no more than 15
minutes trial.  Monitor O2 sats and patient's respirations.
Maintain tube feeds.  Remain NPO.  Obtain a video swallow
study tomorrow to rule out aspiration.

The remainder of the chart will be dictated upon discharge of
the patient.

Date of Birth:   [**2067-1-31**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

ADDENDUM:  Discharge date is still yet to be determined.
This is a dictation summary addendum to be addended to
dictation summary performed on report date [**2127-2-5**];
encompassing the course of this [**Hospital 1325**] hospital course
from [**2127-2-6**] through [**2127-2-14**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient was transferred to
the Medicine Service for further management of her congestive
heart failure.  It was noted that through her hospital course
she was receiving fluids for hydration for her kidneys for
anticipation of an angiogram to further examine the arteries
of her lower legs.  However, during this time, it was noted
that she increasing shortness of breath as well as an
increasing renal insufficiency.

She was transferred to a cardiac floor and was begun on a
nesiritide drip; however, due to concomitant issues of
infection, her blood pressures often began hypotensive and
had difficulty tolerating the nesiritide drip.  She then
experienced an episode of supraventricular tachycardia that
may be attributed to nesiritide, and her nesiritide was
discontinued.  She was switched to Bumex 1 mg intravenously
b.i.d. and this was increased to 2 mg intravenously b.i.d.,
and the patient continued to have goo diuresis with greater
than one liter per day negative urine output.

A right-sided thoracentesis was performed which revealed a
transudative effusion that was felt to be secondary to her
congestive heart failure.  Approximately four days later, a
left-sided thoracentesis was performed which also revealed a
transudative effusion that was also secondary to her
congestive heart failure.

2.  SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA:  The patient was noted to
have episodes of supraventricular tachycardia noted on
telemetry with an unstable blood pressure with systolic blood
pressures dropping into the 60s.  She was immediately
cardioverted at 200 joules; at which time she responded back
into a normal sinus rhythm.

She was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for
further observation after her cardioversion.  It was felt
that her arrhythmia may be secondary to nesiritide, and this
drug was subsequently discontinued.  She remained without
arrhythmia throughout her 2-day course in the Coronary Care
Unit and was transferred back to the floor.

Upon returning to the general medicine floor, she again
showed episodes of supraventricular tachycardia which was
characterized as atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response, and Electrophysiology was consulted for further
evaluation and recommended amiodarone.  Amiodarone was
subsequently started, and at the time of this dictation the
patient was tolerating this without any complications.  A
Holter monitor was ordered to have further evaluation of her
QTc interval and will continuing having this Holter monitor
for a total of two weeks.

3.  TRACHEOBRONCHITIS:  The patient was noted to have an
acute increase in her tracheal secretion, and a leukocytosis
sputum and blood cultures remained negative; however,
clinically, she seemed to be having more difficulty
breathing.

An Infectious Disease Service was consultation was obtained
and agreed with starting levofloxacin and vancomycin in
addition to her Flagyl and continued a course of seven days
of these antibiotics.  She markedly improved with an abrupt
decrease in secretions.  Her leukocytosis returned to within
normal limits and appeared much more comfortable clinically.
These antibiotics were discontinued, and the patient
continued in stable condition.

4.  ASPIRATION:  The patient was evaluated by bedside Speech
and Swallow Service who evaluated for possible aspiration.
They indicated that the patient had intact swallowing
function and aspiration precautions were not necessary.

Cardaic catheterization: Selective coronary angiography revealed
a right dominant system with patent LMCA and proximal LAD. Mid
LAD had a long 80% lesion. D1 had a 70% stenosis. LCX was
proximally totally occluded. RCA was free of angiographically
apparent disease. Left ventriculography was deferred.
Hemodynamic assessment showed normal left and right sided
filling pressures and low normal cardiac index. Successful
stenting  of the LCX with 3.5x28mm Cypher and a 3.0x8mm Cypher
(post dilated to 3.5mm). Occluded right iliac vessel.

ECHO ([**2174-6-13**]):Mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w CAD. Possible regional right ventricular free
wall hypokinesis. Mild mitral regurgitation. EF 55%

CXR([**2174-6-13**]): New mild to moderate heart failure.  Resolv
opacity in the right upper lobe.


Brief Hospital Course:
58 year old male w/ unknown PMH s/p vfib arrest. Cath revealed
LCx complete occlusion, which was stented.

#Cardiac: Had acute MI, with cypher stent placed in the left
circumflex artery. He was continued on aspirin, plavix,
atorvastatin, and metoprolol. Echo showed EF of 55%. s/p VF
arrest, had atrial fibrillation in the ED. Got amio loaded in
field. Was in sinus later and amio discontinued.  Pt remained
hemodynamically stable following revascularization, without
chest pain or further arrhythmias.  He will need to follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] within the month.
.
#Neuro: Suffered anoxic brain injury as it took 20 minutes
before heart revived after the vfib arrest.  Upon arrival at
[**Hospital1 18**], pt underwent head & neck CT, which were unremarkable.
Neuro was consulted.  Pt started on cooling protocol.  Following
cooling protocol, pt was weaned off sedatives, and slowly began
showing signs of increasing neurologic function.  Following
cessation of paralytics, pt was able to move all extremities
without deficits; he was seen by PT and OT who both felt that he
would benefit from a rehab stay.  He required soft, ground diet
initially, though was transitioned to full PO after further
evaluation by speech & swallow.  The degree of anoxic brain
injury sustained is unclear, though MRI was unrevealing for
significant anoxic damage (see report).  The pt is pleasant & is
oriented to self.  However, he is not oriented to place or time,
indicating some cognitive deficits.

## Respiratory failure: Patient intubated in setting of code,
but extubated within 48 hours, without further respiratory
problems.

## Pneumonia: Had leukocytosis on admission thought to be
secondary to stress response; however, his leukocytosis
persisted and his CXR revealed a RUL infiltrate, thought to be
aspiration.  He was initially started on levaquin and flagyl,
but later changed to vancomycin and zosyn given that he had been
on a ventilator (to cover nosocomial pathogens).  His
infiltrates resolved on chest x-ray and he completed a 7 day
course of antibiotics in house.  His oxygen saturation was
consistently > 97% on RA.

## EtOH: Pt reportedly drinks 6-12 beers/day.  He required about
20 mg of valium on the 4th-5th days of hospitalization, however
subsequently has not required any more doses, without any signs
of withdrawal.

## FEN: He was seen by speech and swallow who cleared him for a
PO diet with ground solids and thin liquids (cardiac heart
healthy).  He should continue on this diet for now, but should
have a repeat speech and swallow evaluation at rehab at some
point, as he may be able to have his diet advanced in the near
future.

## Social: From SOCIAL WORK--Pt has reported HX of EtOH abuse.
SW met briefly
with pt and 2 sisters, then alone with sisters with pt's
permission while he had a PT eval.  Pt presented as anxious and
expressed wish to return home in near future.  [**Name (NI) 1094**] sisters,
[**Name (NI) **] and [**Name (NI) **], talked about their ambivalence about taking
control while pt was confused, as pt has compartmentalized his
life in past, so they were not familiar with his friends, and
had
limited knowledge of his ex-wife and family.  Sisters expressed
concern pt has hx of heavy EtOH abuse since adolescence.  They
state pt's mother expressed concern about his drinking when she
was alive and pt lived with her.  Sisters have found large
quantities of beer in his house and car since his
hospitalization.  They note pt is a much loved high school
teacher and coach, and they have been surprised by the magnitude
of public support for him in his small town.  Sisters do not
believe pt has ever had a DUI or legal consequences for
drinking,
nor blackouts, missed work or any previous attempts at sobriety.
[**Name (NI) 1094**] sister's articulate being committed to supporting pt's
needs
in community though one lives in OH.  Sisters report pt was
fully
independent with all [**Name (NI) 5669**] PTA, exercised regularly (swimming),
gave up running due to past hip replacements.  Family note
significant improvement in pt's mental status, but are aware of
ST memory deficits.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Cardiac arrest.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49 year old man
who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit status
post cardiac arrest.  History was obtained per the Emergency
Department report as well as from the patient's family.
Information was very limited regarding the circumstances of
his cardiac arrest.  Reportedly, the patient was at a local
restaurant where he was noted to be unresponsive.  EMS was
called and reported to arrive on scene within three minutes.
The patient was asystolic but regained a perfusing rhythm
after 2 mg of Epinephrine and 2 mg of Atropine.  He was
intubated in the field and brought to the Emergency
Department.  He remained unresponsive despite the
administration of Narcan.  CT examinations of the head,
chest, abdomen and pelvis were all unremarkable. Initial
chest x-ray showed a left retrocardiac opacity and prominent
interstitium though his lung volumes were low.  Subsequent
chest x-ray showed right main stem intubation with left lung
collapse which had corrected with withdrawal of the
endotracheal tube.

The patient was then transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for induced hypothermia given his
hemodynamic stability, ongoing unresponsiveness and recent
out of hospital cardiac arrest.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1) Hypertension.

2) Chronic low back pain, s/p lumbar discectomy x 2.

3) Cirrhosis.

4) h/o stab wound complicated by pneumothorax.

5) h/o lower extremity cellulitis.

6) s/p cholecystectomy.

7) Peripheral neuropathy.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  According to his pharmacy, he was
on:
1. OxyContin 40 mg p.o. q12hours.
2. Percocet.
3. Nortriptyline.
4. Neurontin 1800 mg four times a day


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is divorced.  His son is a
policeman working in [**Name (NI) 8545**].  He drinks greater than one
case of beer per day.  He has a history of abuse of Percocet
according to his brother.  [**Name (NI) **] is currently homeless.  He was
recently arrested for altering a prescription according to
his pharmacy.  He had recently filled a prescription for 560
tablets of Percocet as well as 60 tablets of OxyContin early
last month.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for any history of sudden death or
coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 96.2,
blood pressure 150/80, heart rate 92, respiratory rate 16.
In general, he was unarousible, intubated, not on any
sedation.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - His pupils
were equal and three millimeters.  They were minimally
reactive.  His sclerae were anicteric.  The cardiac
examination was unremarkable without murmurs.  The lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His abdomen had normal
bowel sounds, soft and nontender.  Extremities had multiple
bilateral lower extremity excoriations.  Neurologic
examination - he was unarousible and without sedation.  He had no
spontaneous movements.  Flaccid.  Extremities - Babinski
reflex was equivocal bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  At the time of admission, laboratories were
remarkable for a partial thromboplastin time of 31.7, INR
1.4, potassium 3.2, glucose 182, lactate was initially 6.6.
Urine toxicology screen was negative.  Serum toxicology
screen was positive for TCAs.  Tylenol level was 15.  Alcohol
level was 199.  Initial blood gas was 7.31/46/500/77.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiac arrest - His arrest was of unknown
etiology at the time of admission.  No further history was
ever gained about his cardiac arrest throughout his
hospitalization.  CT angiogram had been negative for
pulmonary embolism.  The patient had an echocardiogram on
[**2164-4-27**], which showed a normal ejection fraction and
trivial mitral regurgitation; otherwise no obvious
abnormalities were seen.

Given the patient had an out of hospital arrest, remained
unresponsive despite hemodynamic stability, he was treated
with induced hypothermia and with cold packs and a cooling
blanket were placed with goals of reducing his core body
temperature to 32 degrees Celsius for a period of twelve
hours at which point he would be rewarmed over the subsequent
six hours.  This was done, however, as in problem number two
below, we were not successful in any neurologic recovery.

Neurology - The patient remained unresponsive after the
induced hypothermia, the patient was noticed to develop
myoclonic jerks and occasional fluttering of his eyelids.
Electroencephalogram revealed the patient was experiencing
persistent seizure activity.  Neurology was consulted and the
patient was treated very aggressively, loaded with multiple
drugs, including Ativan and Propofol drips.  The patient
continued to demonstrate seizure activity despite this.  He was
loaded with Dilantin and ultimately was treated with a Pentobarb
coma.  After multiple attempts of weaning the Pentobarb, the
patient was continually reverting to status epilepticus which was
never able to be suppressed.

Infectious disease - Over the course of his hospital stay,
the patient's white blood cell count rose to a peak of 17.
Multiple cultures were done and the patient was ultimately
found to have methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
bacteremia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection.  For all
these infections, the patient was treated with Vancomycin and
he was also on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed
aspiration pneumonia at the time of his admission.  Blood
cultures cleared by [**2164-5-4**].  Sputum culture as late as
[**2164-5-11**], however was still positive for coagulase positive
Staphylococcus which was methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus.

The patient remained gravely ill throughout his
hospital stay and had multiple meetings were held with his
family with his son being his next of [**Doctor First Name **].  Ultimately it was
decided that the patient's wishes would be to not be
maintained in a vegetative state and given his poor prognosis
ultimately the decision was made to pursue comfort measures
only.  With these goals of care, the patient expired on
[**2164-5-12**].  The family did consent to a postmortem
examination.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Cardiac arrest.

Anoxic brain injury

Status epilepticus

Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.

MRSA urinary tract infection.

MRSA Bacteremia.

like she ""was dying.""  Per family, she has not had any known
recent fevers and her abdomen apparently looked more distended
per the family but she was not complaining of this.  In the
ambulance, she was in sinus rhythm, HR 87 w/ LBBB compared to
prior with 2mm ST elevations in V1-V2 with TWI and ST
depressions in V4-6, I, II and TWIs in II, III, aVF (only change
in III with upright QRS compared to prior).  Pt then develeoped
a wide complex tachy concerning for VTach and was shocked with
200J x 2 and 360J x 1.  At [**Hospital 46**] Hosp, she was loaded with Amio
150mg and put on Amio gtt 1 mg/kg/min.  She was intubated with
initial gas 7.07/60/163.  She received Lasix 20 iv x 2, 4 mg
Morphine and placed on Nitro gtt for bp in 160's, ASA 325, Hep
and Integrelin gtts and given Rochepin 1g x 1.  Trop < 0.02, Dig
level < 0.04 at OSH.  Pt also received Plavix 600mg x1.  Pt was
found to be in DKA with BS 384 and anion gap 17, given 5 u
insulin and placed on insulin gtt.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for cath w/ ABG 7.12/52/236 and lactate 11.
     In the cath lab, pt was HD unstable on Nitro with sbp drop
to 30's.  Nitro was stopped and Dopamine was started.  She had
episodes of VTach and shocked twice.  She remained hypoxic
despite mech ventilation and PaO2 50-60's.  Levophed was added.
Cath showed no significant CAD.  Limited Ventriculogram showed
EF 35%, PA gram without thrombus, and ? healed VSD with ? Right
to Left shunt given decreased PaO2.  IABP placed and she was
transferred to CCU on dopa and Levophed gtts.

Portable chest, [**2163-2-13**]
An intraaortic balloon pump is present with the radiodense tip
terminating
approximately 3 cm below the superior aspect of the aortic knob.
An
endotracheal tube terminates about 4.5 cm above the carina, and
a Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the right interlobar
pulmonary artery. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.
There is vascular engorgement, and there is a bilateral pattern
of perihilar alveolar opacities, with sparing of the extreme
lung periphery. This is asymmetric, right greater than left, and
is superimposed upon a more diffuse interstitial pattern with
bilateral septal thickening. An area of hyperlucency is seen
adjacent to both heart borders and probably is related to
pulsation artifact. Anterior medial pneumothoraces are
considered less likely, but attention to these areas on followup
chest radiograph is suggested.
IMPRESSION:
1. Lines and tubes in satisfactory position.
2. Extensive pulmonary edema.
3. Hyperlucency adjacent to both heart borders.
.
[**2163-2-13**] KUB:
A nonobstructive bowel gas pattern is visualized. Contrast
material is
identified within the renal collecting systems and bladder.
Correlation with timing of contrast administration is suggested,
as no contrast enhanced CT scans are reported at this
institution. A nasogastric tube is noted within the stomach.
Femoral vascular catheters are noted bilaterally, with a left
femoral venous line coursing into the IVC. On a separately
dictated chest radiograph, this is shown to represent a
pulmonary arterial catheter.
.
[**2163-2-16**]:  Non-contrast axial head CT.
FINDINGS: There are multiple hypodense foci scattered throughout
the
subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres,
representing the
sequela of small vessel infarction. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
junction is intact. The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci
demonstrate no effacement. There is no mass effect or shift of
normally midline structures. There is a fluid level within the
sphenoid sinus, likely be secondary to intubation. Bilateral
mastoid air cells demonstrate some opacification that could be
air, fluid, or combination of the two, again likely the result
of intubation. The other paranasal sinuses are clear.
The osseous structures are unremarkable. Calcification of the
cavernous
carotid arteries is secondary to atherosclerotic disease.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage. MR brain is
recommended for the evaluation of acute brain ischemia, if of
clinical concern.
.
[**2163-2-17**]: MRI OF THE BRAIN.
FINDINGS: There are areas of abnormality on the
diffusion-weighted sequence in the left parietal and left
occipital lobe. There are corresponding abnormalities on the
FLAIR sequence consistent with subacute infarcts. The areas of
abnormality are small consistent with multiple emboli and
multiple distributions. There is no definite evidence of mass
effect or hemorrhage. There are multiple T2 high signal
intensity foci in the periventricular white matter and centrum
semiovale consistent with microvascular angiopathy. There is no
evidence of a focal extra-axial lesion or fluid collection.
IMPRESSION: Multiple diffusion abnormalities in the left
hemisphere as
described. Some of these are referable to the middle cerebral
artery
circulation, some referable to the posterior. It is noted that
there is a
fetal type posterior communicating artery on the left, so that
these might
represent systemic emboli but may also represent emboli from a
left carotid lesion.
MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **] AND ITS MAJOR TRIBUTARIES.
FINDINGS: There is no definite evidence of aneurysm. The left
vertebral
artery is not visualized and may be occluded below the level of
foramen
magnum. There is a fetal type posterior communicating artery on
the left,
supplying the left posterior cerebral artery. The P1 portion of
the left
posterior cerebral artery is diminutive. There appears to be
some reduced
flow in the posterior cerebral artery on the left compared to
the right.
IMPRESSION: Fetal type posterior communicating artery on the
left, so that
the lesions noted on the brain MR may be coming from the carotid
circulation. There is some diminished flow in the left posterior
cerebral artery, consistent with some obstruction.
.
[**2163-2-17**]: Carotid Ultrasound: Heterogeneous calcific plaque
involving the internal carotid arteries bilaterally. The peak
systolic velocities on the right are 141, 69, and 69 cm/sec for
the ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. Similar values on the left
of 120, 80, and 71 cm/sec. There is antegrade flow involving
both vertebral arteries.
IMPRESSION: Findings as stated above which indicate bilateral
40-59% ICA
stenoses.
.
[**2163-2-18**]: LDL 67  HDL 38  TGs 144
.
[**2163-2-22**]: CT Abd/Pelvis
TECHNIQUE: Axial non-contrast CT images of the abdomen and
pelvis were
obtained. Sagittal and coronal reconstructions were also
performed.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are dependent
atelectases, but otherwise, the lung bases are clear. There is a
huge hematoma with a fluid- fluid level involving the left psoas
muscle, and bilaterally, there are also multiple smaller
hematomas in the iliacus muscles as well. The large left psoas
hematoma measures 11 x 12 mm in axial dimensions, and it is
surrounded by some inflammatory stranding. The iliacus muscles
bilaterally are expanded, with fluid- fluid levels within these
as well. There are calcifications in the femoral arteries
bilaterally, which cannot be evaluated well.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The sigmoid shows an
anastomotic site consistent with prior resection. The uterus,
adnexal regions, and bladder are unremarkable. There is Foley
catheter and air within the bladder. There is no inguinal or
pelvic lymphadenopathy. There is no hematoma in either groin.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

IMPRESSION: Large acute hematomas involving the left psoas, and
bilateral
iliacus muscles.
.
[**2163-2-22**]: Left Groin ultrasound
FINDINGS: Ultrasound examination of the vascular structures of
the left groin show normal compressibility, waveform, and color
flow within the left common femoral vein and superficial femoral
vein. No pseudoaneurysm or evidence of AV fistula is seen. No
thrombus is seen within the common femoral vein.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula within
the imaged
vascular structures of the left groin.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo F with DM, HTN, AFib presents after resp distress,
intubated, VTach s/p shock x 5, transferred from OSH for cath
without signficant CAD, requiring pressors, IABP placed, in DKA,
WBC 22, lactate 11 at OSH and 3 here.  Extubation was attempted
once and patient required re-intubation for respiratory distress
and was found to have acute pulmonary edema.  Patient was then
noted to be moving all extremities except her right arm.  Head
CT was done and evidence of CVAs.  Head MRI/MRA was then done
and she was found to have occipital and parietal strokes (likely
sub-acute), likely emboli from Atrial Fibrillation, although
carotid ultrasounds also revealed 40-59% bilateral Internal
carotid artery stenosis.  In retrospect, it was thought that
inciting event was likely the stroke, patient may have aspirated
making her short of breath as well as a component of pulmonary
edema from mitral regurgitation (and worsening of pulm edema
from tachycardia).  Patient was diuresed for several days,
continued on antibiotics and successfully extubated on [**2163-2-19**].
Patient was talking clearly with inability to move right arm on
the day of extubation, but each day improved was moving arm,
hand and fingers prior to discharge.  On [**2-22**], patient was noted
to have back pain and decreased hematocrit.  Stat Abd/Pelvis CT
scan was performed and she had a large retroperitoneal bleed
into left psoas and bilateral iliacus muscles.  Vascular surgery
was consulted the same day, q6 hematocrits were performed and
patient was transfused 2 units pRBCs on the first day with FFP
(given increased INR/PTT on heparin, coumadin and aspirin at the
time).  The following day she was tranfused 3 additional units
and one unit of FFP.  She was given one dose of vitamin K.  Left
femoral ultrasound on [**2-22**] was performed and no evidence of
pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula was seen.  Retroperitoneal was
thought to be spontaneous from anticoagulation.  Aspirin,
Heparin and Coumadin was held.
.
1.  CV:
     Ischemia: no significant CAD on cath, no evidence of MI.
On ASA.
     Pump: EF 35-40%.  Checked Echo on [**2-15**] and [**2-18**] EF 30-35%.
Preload: goal i's and o's even to slightly negative on lasix
doses.
          Contractility: Requiring dopamine on admission and
then stopped.
          Afterload: Intra-aortic balloon pump d/c'ed on [**2-14**].
Off pressors with goal MAP > 60.
          Rhythm: Amio added for ? AFib on [**2-14**].  This was
d/c'ed on [**2-15**].  pt appeared to be in AFib w/ RVR.  Started on
Esmolol on [**2-15**] w/ period of rate control and sinus rhythm but
then went back into AFib w/RVR HR 105-130. Amiodarone was
restarted with better rate controlled, received several days of
Amio 400 mg po TID, plan for 1 week of Amio 200 mg po tid, then
1 week Amio 200 po bid then switch to Amio 200 po qday.  Added
beta-blocker for additional rate control.  Given atrial
fibrillation and evidence of CVAs on Head MRI/CT, patient would
likely benefit from long term anti-coagulation.
Anti-coagulation was held when patient found to have
retroperitoneal bleed, but should restart, plan to start Aspirin
one week after discharge and coumadin 2 weeks after discharge.
.
2.  ID: Possible infection on admission given elevated WBC ct
and ?DKA of unknown source on admission.  Empirically started on
Zosyn and Levoflox (for double gram negative coverage), Vanco
and Flagyl.  CXR w/pulm edema and KUB wnl.  Patient febrile on
[**2-13**].  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test wnl.  D/C Flagyl on [**2-14**], d/c'ed Zosyn on
[**2-15**], d/c'ed Vanco on [**2-16**].  No OSH Cxs. UA negative.  Restarted
on Vanco and Zosn when spiked temp and completed 5 additional
days of these antibiotics for possible nosocomial pneumonia.
.
3.  DM: possible DKA on admission, on insulin gtt on admission.
Changed to RISS on [**2-14**].  Monitored finger sticks.
.
4.  Resp: Intubated on admission.  Pt was extubated on [**2-15**], but
desatted, increased HR, resp distress, reintubated for likely
pulmonary edema.  She was successfully extubated on [**2-20**] without
further events, breathing comfortably.
.
5.  Neuro: patient noted to not be moving R arm on [**2-16**].  Head
CT with multiple foci of ischemic/embolic change.  Consulted
Neurology.  Head MRI with occipital and parietal emboli.
Started Heparin gtt but stopped when patient noted to have
retroperitoneal bleed.    Checked carotid U/S with b/l 40-59%
ICA stenosis.  Neuro recommended aspirin 325mg po qday to start
one week after hematocrit stable.
.
6.  FEN: NPO, monitor lytes in setting of DKA.
.
7.  GI: Protonix [**Hospital1 **] for UGI Bleed, consider Protonix gtt,
however, concerned about volume overload, so will cont [**Hospital1 **] for
now.  NG lavage with coffee grounds and some bright red blood on
[**2-13**].  q6-8 hr Hcts, transfuse prn.  Consulted GI on [**2-13**],
appreciate recs, no urgent need for scope unless increased UGI
bleed.  Abd XRay done, no obstruction seen.
.
8.  Heme: decreased Hct on admission, likely from UGI bleed
which has since stabilized.  Patient received 2 unit pRBCs on
[**12-3**].  Patient then found to have retroperitoneal bleed on
[**2-22**], anti-coagulation with aspirin, coumadin, heparin held,
patient received 5 additional units of pRBCs and FFP.
Hematocrit stabilized on [**2-24**].

FULL CODE
.
Disposition: Patient to go to acute rehab facility per physical
therapy recommendations.  She made signficant progress in moving
her right arm s/p CVA but is deconditioned from 2 weeks
hospitalization.  She was started on Amiodarone and Toprol for
Atrial fibrillation control.  Plan for Amiodarone was to
complete 1 week of Amiodarone 200 po tid and can transition to
Amio 200 po bid on [**2-28**] to complete 1 week and then transition
to 200 mg po qday.  It was felt that patient would benefit from
long term aspirin as well as coumadin.  Aspirin to be started
one week after discharge from the hospital and Coumadin to be
started two weeks after discharge from the hospital with close
monitoring of PT/INR.  Hematocrits should also be checked every
few days, although has been stable in the several days prior to
discharge.  Patient to follow-up with cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]

History of Present Illness:
77 year-old female who was admitted to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2168-4-3**]
with worsening dyspnea on exertion and was found to be in acute
diastolic heart failure and recurrent atrial fibrillation. She
reports she has been SOB since [**Month (only) **].
It has progressively gotten worse to the point that she could
not take a shower or wash her face without getting SOB. She also
has had worsening palpitations and knows she has been in Afib
more often than usual since then. On the evening of admission to
[**Hospital1 46**] she ""thought she was going to die"" so called the
ambulance and was taken to the OSH ED. Initial ECG showed afib
with rate in
the 90s and chronic LBBB. She was given IV Lasix and bipap and
after a few hours felt better. She underwent an echo which
showed [**4-1**] + MR (worse from previous echos) and regional wall
motion abnormalities. EF was reportedly at 50-55%.  She is being
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of her mitral
regurgitation. She has been referred to cardiac surgery for
evaluation of a mitral valve replacement.

TEE Intra-op [**2168-4-13**]
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus is seen in the
left atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is present. A
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %). The septal wall appears to be
dyskinetic, although this may be due to dyssynchrony (the septal
wall does not thin during systole.)

Right ventricular chamber size is normal. The RV systolic
function is borderline normal.

There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic
dissection is seen.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis. There is a filamentous mobile strand on the tip
of the right coronary cusp that is concerning for fibroelastoma.
The non-cororary cusp appears slightly redundant. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. A moderate to severe (3+) central jet of
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate MAC.

POST-CPB:
There is a bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position. The valve
is well-seated with normal leaflet mobility. The native MV
support structures are still in place. There is trace central
MR, there is no paravalvular leak. The peak gradient across the
mitral valve is 14mmHg, the mean gradient is 6mmHg with CO 4.5.

The filamentous structure on the aortic valve is no longer seen,
consistent resection. There is no AS or AI.

There is no residual PFO after PFO repair.

The LV systolic function appears improved with the patient being
on Epi, Norepi, and Milrinone infusions; estimated EF = 45%. The
septal wall shows dyssynchronous movement. The RV is mildly
hypokinetic.

There is no aortic dissection.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at the
time of study.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2168-4-13**] where
the patient underwent MVReplacement with 27mm tissue valve,
CABG, PFO closure, Maze  Overall the patient tolerated the
procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU
in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1
found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor
support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently
diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  Amiodarone was
initiated for atrial fibrillation.  The patient did go into
complete heart block.  EP was consulted and antiarrhythmics were
discontinued.  Transvenous wire was placed.  She progressed to
junctional rhythm and eventually to sinus rhythm.  Atrial
fibrillation returned and beta blocker was resumed. She did
convert to sinus rhythm and transvenous wire was removed.
Anticoagulation was resumed for atrial fibrillation after wire
was removed. She is to take 7.5 mg Coumadin on [**4-22**] for atrial
fibrillation with INR to be checked [**4-23**] for goal INR [**3-3**].  The
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By
the time of discharge on POD 9, the patient was ambulating with
assistance, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with
oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to the [**Hospital 1319**]
Rehab Hospital-[**Hospital3 **] in good condition with appropriate
follow up instructions.

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Ventricular fibrillation arrest.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year old
woman who was dancing at a wedding when she suddenly
collapsed.  Bystanders commenced cardiopulmonary
resuscitation and emergency medical technicians placed an AAD
and shocked her at 200 joules, which converted her to a
normal rhythm.  She was down for approximately five minutes
and subsequently transferred to an outside hospital.

The patient was stabilized at the outside hospital and
transferred on Lopressor, Lidocaine drip, nitroglycerin
paste, morphine, Ativan and levofloxacin.  She was then taken
for a cardiac catheterization on [**2125-7-16**], which revealed
global hypokinesis with a left ventricular ejection fraction
of about 40%.  The left main coronary artery was diffusely
diseased with 80% ostial stenosis, left anterior descending
artery 70% origin, and the mid and distal left anterior
descending artery were small and diffusely diseased.  The
left circumflex had 95% origin stenosis, and right coronary
artery had 60% ostial and 60% mid-stenosis.  An intra-aortic
balloon pump was correctly placed.  After stabilization, the
patient was subsequently evaluated for cardiac surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Hypercholesterolemia.  2.
Borderline diabetes mellitus, recently discovered.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking about 15 to 20
years ago after a 15 pack year history.  She is a social
drinker.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's mother had three myocardial
infarctions.  She has a family history of diabetes mellitus
on the paternal side.

ALLERGIES:  Keflex (hives).

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:  Lipitor, dose unknown.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient has had an intentional 20
pound weight loss over the last several months.  She had had
recent episodes of dyspnea on exertion while walking stairs.
She has no complaints of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, night
sweats or chest pain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
had a temperature of 99.1, heart rate 72, blood pressure
110/38, respiratory rate 16 and oxygen saturation 100%.  She
was ventilated with SIMV 600-17-0.7 with a PEEP/pressure
support [**5-20**].  General:  Intubated and sedated but responded
to voice.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation, conjunctivae
injected, anicteric sclerae.  Neck:  Supple with no
discernable jugular venous distention or bruits.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2,
II/VI systolic ejection murmur.  Lungs:  Coarse bilaterally.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room
on [**2125-7-17**] for coronary artery bypass grafting times
three.  Grafts included left internal mammary artery to the
left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to the posterior
descending coronary artery.  The procedure was performed
without complication and the patient was subsequently
transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.

The intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued on
postoperative day number one and the patient was successfully
weaned from drips and extubated.  She was adequately fluid
resuscitated and hemodynamically stabilized in the Intensive
Care Unit.  The patient continued to do well and was
subsequently transferred to the floor on postoperative day
number three.

On the floor, the patient had several episodes of atrial
fibrillation.  She was converted to sinus rhythm with
intravenous Lopressor.  Oral doses of Lopressor and
amiodarone were progressively increased.  These episodes of
atrial fibrillation soon ceased without any further episodes.

The patient's course was also complicated somewhat by periods
of confusion.  She was followed closely by her family and
staff and, eventually, this confusion diminished and she was
at her baseline mental status.  Her stay on the floor was
also remarkable for some small amounts of drainage from her
incision site.  The fluid was nonpurulent looking and there
was no erythema around her incision.  Clindamycin was started
for a two week course for treatment of this possible
infection.

The patient continued to improve daily.  She was ambulating
well.  She was tolerating an oral diet and her pain was under
good control.  By postoperative day number nine, the patient
continued to do well and was felt to be stable to be
discharged home.

Physical examination on discharge:  Vital signs:  Temperature
99.3, pulse 68, blood pressure 169/53, respiratory rate 18
and oxygen saturation 93% on two liters.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended,
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Trace edema.  Incision:
Draining slightly, with no erythema or purulent material.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home with
VNA assistance.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Metoprolol 50 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Amiodarone 200 mg p.o.q.d.

Awoke on evening [**Date range (1) 15001**] acutely short of breath, partially
relieved by nitro. Was able to sleep sitting up, but then early
in the morning on [**2-22**] the shortness of breath returned. Called
EMS who found his O2 sats to be low, SBP 160s. He received
lasix, morphine 8 mg, ativan 1 mg and nitro paste prior to
transfer to [**Hospital1 **]. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 **] SBP in 60s, HR
30s. He was started on pressors and received atropine x 2. He
was also electively intubated and sedated with propofol. IABP
could not be placed at OSH [**2-11**] to poor femoral pulses. Trop was
0.59, CK flat. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on levophed and
dopamine with SBP in the 70-80s. Vent settings on transfer: AC

.
In the cath lab found to have severe 3 vessel disease, which was
not stented. Elevated wedge at 65 - received lasix, nipride, and
nitro gtt. IABP placed and pressure improved to 30. TEE was done
in lab and showed anterior wall hypokineses, mild AI and mod MR,
which improved when IABP was restarted. When patient was bolused
with versed in the cath lab became hypotensive requiring
discontinuation of nitroprusside and nitro gtts; dopamine was
restarted. Patient was transferred from cath lab to CCU

hemodialysis catheter placement via the right internal jugular
venous approach with the tip positioned in the right atrium


Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo male w/ HTN, DM, s/p recent NSTEMI who presented to OSH
after developing chest pain and SOB, intubated at OSH for
increasing hypoxia and concern for pulmonary edema.  Cardiac
cath revealed severe 3VD with decreased EF, elevated pulmonary
pressures, and thrombocytopenia.  He was not a CT surgical
candidate, so he underwent repeat cardiac catheterization with
atherectomy and placement of BMS to the LAD.
.
# Cardiogenic shock/CHF - The patient presented in shock, most
likely due to LV dysfunction secondary to underlying ischemia.
This resulted in systemic hypoperfusion, hypoxemia and lactic
acidosis.  He had elevated cardiac enzymes and severe 3 vessel
CAD at cath, felt not ammenable for stenting initially.  He was
evaluated but deemed not a CT surgical candidate, so was taken
for cath to undergo high risk intervention.  He received
rotational atherectomy with stent placement x2 (BMS).  Initially
he had increased R and L sided pressures, w/ extremely elevated
PCWP of 65; this improved after diuresis and placement of IABP.
He was started on CVVH for volume removal.  Initail echo showed
EF 25%, but repeat TEE showed improvemed EF of 35-40%, with
evidence of ant/lat wall hypokinesis, and MR.  His IABP and
pressers were weaned slowly and the patient extubated.  He was
continued on statin, Aspirin, and Plavix.  His blood pressure
remained stable and he was started on low dose b-blocker and
ACEi.  He was transfered to the floor and monitored.  He will be
discharged to rehab and scheduled for follow up with his
cardiologist at [**Hospital6 1109**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], in 1
month.
.
# Ischemia - The patient had a documented NSTEMI and severe 3VD
by c.cath, but was not a surgical candidate due to his poor
overall functioning.  He underwent repeat cardiac cath for high
risk intervention, and had rotational atherectomy and placement
of 2 bare metal stents, to the LAD and diagonal branch.  He was
continued on aspirin, plavix, and statin.  B-blocker and ACEi
were begun once the patient was stabilized.  He will f/u with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist at [**Hospital6 1109**].
.
# Rhythm - The patient had bigeminy initially causing technical
difficulty with balloon pump.  He was then in sinus rhythm for
the remainder of his hospitalization.
.
# Respiratory failure - The patient was intubated on arrival at
[**Hospital1 **] for increasing shortness of breath and dropping O2
sats.  This was likely due to acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema
in setting of impaired cardiac function/shock.   He developed
ventilator-associated pneumonia, initially with enterobacter in
the sputum, then with MSSA.  He received > two weeks of IV
antibiotics (cefepime/cipro, then switched to vancomycin, then
to nafcillin).
.
# Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient was noted to have elevated
bilirubin, (direct primarily) along with mild elevation in LFTs.
 His exam was benign and RUQ was negative.  DIC labs were
checked and were normal.
.
# Thrmobocytopenia: Platelets dropped significantly during the
hospitalization.  HIT and DIC labs were negative.  The likely
etiology was acute inflammation.  The patient's platelets
normalized and remained stable.
.
# Renal failure - The patient had a baseline Cr 3.0- 4.0, but
had not yet started Dialysis.  He was placed on CVVH for volume
removal, and followed by the Renal Service.  After extubation, a
tunnelled catheter (R IJ) was placed and he began hemodialysis
M,W,F, which will be continued after discharge.  His Hepatitis B
serologies are as follows: Surface antigen negative, Surface
antibody positive, Core antibody negative.
.
# Anemia - Normocytic, likely anemia related to chronic kidney
disease.  Iron studies revealed mixed AOCD with iron deficiency
(iron 32, TIBC 191, ferritin 215, transferrin 147).  Folate was
>20, and vitamin B12 was 795.  He had no obvious source of blood
loss.  Epogen was started three times a week with hemodialysis.
.
# HTN - He was initially on pressers and had a balloon pump.
After these were weaned, low dose b-blocker (metoprolol 12.5
[**Hospital1 **]) and ace-inhibitor (captopril 6.25 tid) were begun.
.
# DM - His Diabetes is longstanding with nephropathy and
blindness.  HgA1C was 6.4 upon admission.  He was on NPH and
regular insulin at home; while on CVVH and TPH, he was given an
insulin drip.  This was changed to a sliding scale.  NPH was not
re-started during the hospitalization as pt's intake was
moderate and sugars were controlled with the sliding scale.
.
# Hyperlipidemia - The patient was continued on lipitor.
.
# FEN - He was placed on TPN while intubated, but restarted on a
renal/cardiac diet after extubation.  He tolerated his diet w/o
difficulty.
.
# Prophylaxis - The patient was on a heparin drip while on the
IABP.  After removal of the balloon pump, he was placed on SC
heparin.  He was kept on a PPI.

thickening. Ultrasound can provide further information if
indicated as differential included third-spacing versus
acalculus cholecystitis.
4. Severe atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Dyspnea: Patient was admitted to the CCU due to his
hypotension requiring dopamine gtt.  In the CCU he underwent
dialysis with improvement in his symptoms.  On the evening of
admission, the patient was noted to be acutely unresponsive and
turned blue.  Telemetry revealed an initial rhythm of PEA then
quickly converted to vfib.  A code was called.  During the code
he was shocked several times, given epi, calcium, d5, insulin,
and bicarb. He then had runs of VT and was shocked with that,
with intermittent loss of pulse. ECG was c/w inferior STEMI. He
was also given amiodarone 150 mg load and started on amio gtt.
He had a bradycardia and was started on dopamine and transiently
levophed. One etiology considered for his arrest was PE as he
was blue from shoulders up at the beginning of code. Heparin gtt
started for treatment of MI or PE.  He was intubated and
remained stable overnight on pressors.  Given the concern for PE
the patient underwent CTA which showed no evidence of clot.
.
# Hypotension: Following cardiac arrest the patient continued to
require pressors for BP support.  On [**5-20**] his hemodynamics
continued to worsen requiring addition of more pressors for
support.  On EKG he had worsening ST elevations in the anterior
leads.  Given he was deemed to be not a surgical candidate he
was continued on medical management.  Over the course of the
evening on [**5-20**] his status continued to worsen. He spiked a
temp. to 102 and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for
presumed sepsis.  During this time he had recurrent episodes of
VT and was shocked for these with return to narrow-complex
rhythm.  Given his worsening status despite multiple pressors
and recurrent arrythmias a discussion was had with the patient's
wife and decision was made to make the patient DNR.  He was made
comfortable and expired at 5am on [**5-21**].
.

Service:  CCU Medicine

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure exacerbation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 76-year-old male
with increasing shortness of breath and PND for a week, who
was in outside hospital until a month ago, where he noted
increasing shortness of breath.  Patient also noted some
irregular heartbeat.  The patient reports increasing PND over
the past week, increasing shortness of breath and increasing
pedal edema without any chest pain.

Patient was seen by his PCP and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was
admitted from home for Heparin, transesophageal
echocardiogram, and cardioversion on Monday.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. New onset afib.
2. Hypertension.
3. CAD status post CABG in '[**18**].
4. CRI.
5. CHF with an ejection fraction of 30%.
6. Gout.
7. AICD with [**Hospital1 **]-V pacing.
8. Hypercholesterolemia.
9. Status post left CEA, status post left renal stent.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

7. Lipitor 40 q.d.
8. Isosorbide 60 a.m. and 30 p.m.
9. Senna 6 q.h.s.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient 25 year two packs per day smoking
history, occasional alcohol, and no IV drug abuse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  110/80, 66, 20, and 95%
on room air.  General:  Obese male sitting in bed in no
apparent distress.  Neck:  12 cm JVD at 90 degrees.  Heart:
irregularly, irregular, no murmurs or gallops.  Lungs are
clear to auscultation bilaterally, no rales.  Abdomen:
Obese, positive bowel sounds, distended.  Extremities:  2+
pedal edema bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORIES:  Echocardiogram on [**12-30**] showed left
ventricular ejection fraction of 30%, 2+ MR, which maybe
underestimated with a [**Hospital1 **]-V pacemaker.  EKG and chest x-ray
are pending.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:  Coronary wise, the patient has coronary
artery disease status post CABG in '[**18**] with occluded SVG and
RCA.  Patient was continued on aspirin and Lipitor.  Patient
initially was hypotensive and his beta blocker was held until
his blood pressure continued to rise.  The patient was ruled
out for MI with three negative cardiac enzymes, and was on a
Heparin drip at that time.

2. Pump:  CHF with an ejection fraction of 30%.
Transesophageal echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of
15% with MR and left bundle branch block.  [**Hospital1 **]-V pacer with
ICD was placed.  For the decompensated CHF, the patient was
kept on dopamine and dobutamine, and all other blood pressure
medications were held, and patient was diuresed effectively
with the combination of dopamine and dobutamine, and Lasix.
Patient was fully weaned off the dopamine and dobutamine on
[**8-23**], which the patient was then transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**].

Patient continued to diurese with decreasing O2 requirements.
However, patient was transferred back to the CCU on [**2127-8-31**]
at which point, patient creatinine had rise from 2.5 to 3.2,
and patient also had mental status changes with increasing
shortness of breath.  Patient was again started on a dopamine
and dobutamine combination with Lasix.  Patient then fell
into cardiogenic shock, and in addition, the patient went
into septic shock.

Additionally to this regimen, digoxin was added.  Patient,
however, was not able to tolerate his ongoing cardiogenic
shock and septic shock and passed away on [**2127-9-2**] which
patient had no spontaneous respirations.  Cause of death is
cardiogenic and combined septic shock.

2. Renal:  Patient had chronic renal insufficiency with
bilateral renal artery stenosis.  His creatinine had risen
from 2.5 to 3.5.  Again, Renal was consulted at this time,
however, due to cardiac issues, patient had further renal
insult with the Lasix, dopamine, and dobutamine combination,
patient however, passed away before his renal issues
resolved.

3. ID:  Patient went into septic shock with WBCs increasing
to 45 and temperature up to 102 when transferred back to the
CCU.  Patient was started on Levaquin and Flagyl for
aspiration community acquired pneumonia.  Patient, however,
passed away secondary to cardiogenic and septic shock before
this issue resolved.

4. GI:  Patient while on the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service had colonic
pseudo-obstruction, which was resolving.  A rectal tube was
placed temporarily to help the colonic pseudo-obstruction.
However, patient remained pseudo-obstructed when the patient
passed away.

5. Pulmonary:  Please see cardiac note.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient again passed away and no autopsy
was done.

CAUSE OF DEATH:  Likely cardiogenic and septic shock.

Heart:  Irregularly irregular, no murmurs or gallops.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no rales.
Abdomen:  Obese, positive bowel sounds, distended.
Extremities:  2+ pedal edema bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Pertinent laboratory data revealed
echocardiogram on [**2127-8-28**] showed left ventricular
ejection fraction of 30%, 2+ mitral regurgitation which may
be underestimated with a biventricular pacemaker.
Electrocardiogram and chest x-ray were pending.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular - Coronary-wise, the
patient has coronary artery disease, status post coronary
artery bypass graft in [**2118**] with an occluded saphenous vein
graft, right coronary artery.  The patient was continued on
Aspirin and Lipitor.  The patient initially was hypotensive
and his beta blocker was held until his blood pressure
continued to rise.  The patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction with three negative cardiac enzymes and was on a
heparin drip at that time.

Pump, congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 38%.
Transesophageal echocardiogram showed ejection fraction of
15% with mitral regurgitation and left bundle branch block.
Biventricular pacer with implantable cardioverter
defibrillator was placed.  For his decompensated congestive
heart failure the patient was kept on Dopamine and Dobutamine
and all other blood pressure medications were held.  The
patient was diuresed effectively with a combination of
Dopamine and Dobutamine and Lasix.  The patient was fully
weaned off of the Dopamine and Dobutamine on [**8-23**],
and the patient was then transferred to C-MED.  The patient
continued to diurese with decreasing oxygen requirements,
however, the patient was transferred back to the Coronary
Care Unit on [**2127-8-31**] at which point the patient

[**6-17**] CXR IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-14**] and 22:
Intraaortic balloon pump has been removed. Lung volumes remain
low with persistent atelectasis at the right base, but
insufficient abnormality in the lungs to explain respiratory
failure. Moderate cardiomegaly and a generally large and
tortuous thoracic aorta are unchanged in appearance. There is no
pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural effusion. Tip of
endotracheal tube is in standard placement at the thoracic
inlet. No pneumothorax.
.
[**6-19**] CT head IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage
.
[**6-22**] Ct Abd Pelvis IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of intra-abdominal collection or large hematoma.
2. Small amount of fluid and air and moderate amount of air in
the abdomen likely related to the peritoneal dialysis.
3. Multicystic kidneys. Some of the cysts are complex and not
well evaluated in this non-contrast study. Some of the cysts are
increased when compared to prior study. There is a new area of
calcification in the left kidney. If indicated this cysts could
be further evaluated with ultrasound or MRI.
4. Gallstones.
5. Severe coronary artery calcifications.

Cath report:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography showed a left dominant system.
LMCA
had a 20% origin stenosis. The LAD had a 90% origin stenosis
involving
also a D1 (90%). Rest of the LAD was diffusely diseased with
60-70%
sequential lesions. LCX had mild itraluminal irregularities with
50% OM
and 60% distal LCX disease. RCA was chronically occluded
distally with
R->L and R->R collaterals.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Aortic root aortography showed markedly dilated aortic root.
4. Hemodynamic assessment reaveled a depressed Cardiac Index
1.7-1.9
and PCWP of 35 (with large V-waves).
5. The lesion in the proximal LAD was predilated with a 2.0 X
09mm
Maverick balloon and stented with a 2.5 X 12mm Minivision stent.
The
final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis,
6. Under fluoroscopic guidance, we then placed a 40cc intra
aortic
balloon pump just beyond the left subclavian origin. Successful
diastolic augmentation of blood pressure was achieved.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca
and IABP.
 PTCA of  vessel.
4. Successful stenting of the proximal LAD lesion with a bare
metal
stent.
5. Successful placement of a 40cc intra aortic balloon pump.
.
[**6-15**] TTE:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with moderate cavity dilation and severe
global hypokinesis. The basal inferior and inferolateral walls
contract best with the more distal left ventricular segments
near akinetic. There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm. No
intraventricular thrombus is identified. Tissue velocity imaging
E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images reviewed)
of [**2130-10-4**], the left ventricular findings are new and c/w
multivessel CAD. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation and
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension are now present.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)
.
COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis [**2133-6-22**] and portable
abdomen [**2133-6-22**].
.
ABDOMEN, UPRIGHT AND SUPINE: Only one of these radiographs
includes the right hemidiaphragm. There are small ovoid-shaped
collections of free intra- abdominal air layering above the
liver and stomach. Large and small bowel are of normal caliber.
There is no evidence of obstruction. Extensive stool is noted
within the right colon. A peritoneal dialysis catheter coils
over the left abdomen into the pelvis. Surrounding osseous and
soft tissue structures are unchanged.
.
IMPRESSION: Small collections of free intra-abdominal air above
the liver and stomach which is expected given presence of
peritoneal dialysis catheter.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 68yo M with ESRD on PD, prostate Ca p/w ACS and
severe 2VD presented with CP and taken to cath lab and found to
have 2VD with stent to LAD and subsequent mental status changes
that have steadily improved.
.
#. CV:
a. [**Name (NI) 2694**] Pt went directly to the cath lab on admission where
he was found to have significant 2VD, s/p bare metal stent to
proximal LAD.  Patient was s/p ACS with unclear culprit lesion,
developed cardiogenic shock and was intubated in CCU for several
days.  Per CT [**Doctor First Name **], was determined not to be a CABG candidate
due to poor touchdowns and severe R sided lesions.  His course
was complicated by a groin bleed (see below).  Continued ASA,
Plavix and high dose statin, and titrated BB to Metoprolol XL
200 mg PO DAILY. Due to known residual coronary lesions, Isordil
10mg TID was initially added for better CP control, but was
ultimately d/c'ed due to low BPs, with the addition of SL NTG
prn for chest pain.  Was initially on Lisinopril 30 mg PO DAILY,
which was also ultimately decreased to 10mg PO QD due to low BP.
Beta blockade will be the most important factor in the medical
management of his CAD, and should not be decreased if at all
possible. He was discharged on Toprol XL 150 mg QD. He should
have f/u with cardiology within the next 6-8 weeks, and see his
PCP soon after discharge from rehabilitation facility.
.
b. Pump - cardiogenic shock, newly depressed EF.  He had
significant volume o/l and LV dysfunction. An IABP was in place
(1:1) with hep gtt after cath.  The balloon was subsequently
removed and we titrated up inotropes/pressors to MAP > 60, CI >
2
A PCWP > 40 determined that he needed aggressive diuresis which
he underwent via PD with renal service following.  Several
liters of fluid were removed by PD and was maintained at
relatively even volume exchanges for several days prior to
discharge.
.
c. Rhythm- AIVR in ED, NSR since. QTc was monitored in setting
of Haldol administration, and was consistently in normal range.
.
#. ESRD on PD x several years -- volume o/l by elev PCWP on
admission, s/p fluid removal by PD for several days, now
euvolemic on exam with even volume exchanges.  Renal following
and maintaining even Is/Os.  He should continue with daily
peritoneal dialysis. He should follow-up with his nephrologist
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] on discharge from rehab facility.
.
#. Groin hematoma- Pt had rapidly expanding groin hematoma of
his right groin in setting of heparin s/p cath.  He was
reintubated in setting of pain when he was uncontrollable and
thrashing in bed.  Hematoma was tamponaded with a pressure
dressing and external fixture and was controlled by the
following day. He had a HCT drop in setting of bleed.
Peripheral pulses were still dopplerable (baseline) throughout.
This has now resolved, with persistent ecchymosis, but stable
HCT x 5 days.
.
#. S/p intubation- done for agitation purposes at first in the
cath lab.  He was successfully weaned by HD #3 but reintubated
the next day s/p groin bleed and uncontrolled behavior,
including trying to get out of bed and resisting pressure on his
bleeding groin.  He was successfully weaned a second time and as
his MS has improved, he has not required further intubation.
.
#. Acute MS changes: Pt has been agitated at times, generally in
the setting of pain, and seemed to have no clear understanding
of what was going on.  He has been on several sedatives and
could have been experiencing medication effects s/p extubation.
His mental status started to clear. He passed speech and
swallow, now on regular renal/cardiac diet.  CT head [**6-19**] ruled
out bleed/new process but did show old lacunar infarct.
Continued Haldol HS and PRN Haldol as needed, with input from
psychiatry service.  His MS improved daily and was near baseline
at time of discharge, with minimal need for Haldol. His Haldol
was discontinued several days before discharge.  His mental
status is approaching baseline, however, he still has some
difficulty performing his own peritoneal dialysis.  He will need
ongoing education in this process while at rehab.
.
#. Abdominal discomfort:  Developed on [**6-22**].  There were initial
concerns for peritoneal fluid infection in setting of ongoing
PD, and dialysate was pink-tinged. Pain may have been due to
hematoma from subcutaneous heparin, which was d/c'ed prior to
d/c, as patient was ambulating well CT Abdomen ruled out bleed,
or other pathology that could explain his symptoms.  Peritoneal
fluid analysis from [**6-22**] showed gram positive cocci in pairs,
not yet speciated. His cell count from his peritoneal fluid was
low, with a very low number of PMNS. He received vancomycin 2 gm
IP x 1; he should have a second dose on [**2133-6-28**].  He had guaiac
negative stool on day of discomfort. LFTs were normal, as were
amylase and lipase. A plain film of the abdomen on [**6-24**]
demonstrates a small amount of intra-abdominal free air, which
is likely secondary to a PD cath that was uncapped for too long.
Repeat analysis of peritoneal fluid showed on 33 WBC, 14% PMNs.
Abdominal pain had significantly improved on day of discharge.
.
#. Guaiac + stools: Pt has documented history of this before and
during this admission, but not for last several days.
Outpatient colonoscopy should be arranged.  HCT remained stable.
.
#. Prostate Ca- Not acute issue while in-house. PSA 0.4. Has f/u
appt with oncology.

Brief Hospital Course:
Death Summary (please see hospital chart for further details):

The pt was admitted w/ CP and SOB as above.  His admission ECG
was unchanged from prior. Cardiac enzymes were elevated, though
trending down.  The morning following admission the pt felt
severe chest pain.  Shortly thereafter he was found to be
bradycardic --> PEA cardiac arrest in the setting of
hyperkalemia.  He received ACLS treatment, including sodium
bicarbonate, and regained normal rhythm and a blood pressure
(estimated resuscitation time <5minutes, pulseless time <20
seconds).  He was taken to the cardiac cath lab, where both the
LAD and LCx stents were widely patent.  He was treated for
hyperkalemia, and a balloon pump was inserted for cardiogenic
shock.
Though the pt was weaned off the IABP, his subsequent hospital
course was complicated.  He was unable to be weaned off
mechanical ventilation (pt developed VAP) and had numerous other
complicating issues.  Because of his very poor prognosis, the
pt's family decided to make him care and comfort measures only
on [**2133-8-9**].  The pt died with his family by his side on [**2133-8-10**]
at 2100.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post ventricular fibrillation
arrest.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old male
who was in his usual state of health until 10:30 when he
became unresponsive, cold, clammy, diaphoretic.  The
patient's wife could not wake him up, and got her son from
upstairs who did mouth-to-mouth while the wife called 9-1-1.
There was about a 20 minute lag between the patient's initial
collapse and getting help from the paramedics.  On arrival,
the patient was noted to be in V fib, shock times two.  The
patient was then intubated, given IV with epi, shocked again
for V fib.  The patient was stabilized at an outside
hospital.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care.  He was started on a lidocaine drip at the outside
hospital.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm.  Dopamine was
given for slightly lowered blood pressure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  CVA ten years ago with slight left hand discoordination.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.
4.  Silent MI years ago by EKG.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin 5 mg q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Daily wine, no tobacco.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No CAD.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
97.0, blood pressure 121/68, pulse 93, patient is on IMV with
tidal volume of 700, respiratory rate of 14, FI02 of 40%, and
a PEEP of 5.  General:  The patient was obese, intubated,
unresponsive.  HEENT:  The pupils were small and nonreactive.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, distant heart
sounds, question of [**3-9**] SEM at the right upper sternal
border.  Lungs:  Diffuse rhonchi bilaterally anterior.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, hypoactive bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  Trace edema bilaterally.  Neurologic:
Unresponsive.  Does not withdrawal to pain.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 18.4, hematocrit
48.4, creatinine 1.3, INR 4.0, CK 464, MB 18, troponin less
than 0.3.  ABGs showed gas of 7.24, 45, 171.

EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 97, biphasic Ts in V1,
left axis deviated, normal intervals, Q waves and T wave
inversions unchanged, no ST depressions or elevations.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is a 78-year-old man with V
fib arrest down about 15-20 minutes before being shocked.
Although there is no history of MI documented, the patient
has EKG evidence of prior IMI and anterior MI, V fib was
either ischemic but more likely secondary to scar focus.  At
the outside hospital, the patient received lidocaine drip
which was discontinued here.  The patient required dopamine
for blood pressure support.

The patient ruled out for MI, and eventually came off of all
blood pressure medications.  He was initially noted to have
what appeared to be myoclonic jerks.  It was difficult to say
whether or not these were seizures.  An EEG was obtained
which showed that the patient was in status epilepticus.  The
patient was loaded with Dilantin and given Ativan.
Unfortunately, the patient's mental status never improved.
His reflexes were intact and his pupils were reactive,
however, he had no withdrawal to pain.

Neurology was consulted.  There was a decision made that an
MRI would not be helpful at this point.  A family meeting was
held.  The family thought that the patient would not want
this kind of life.  Given the fact that he was down about
15-20 minutes, the likelihood of anoxic injury is quite
large. The decision was made to withdrawal support.  The
patient expired within several minutes off of the ventilator.

CODE STROKE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
MRI/MRA head

endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
 The pt is an 87 year-old right-handed woman with a prior
history of stroke who presented with alteration in mental
status.

The pt was unable to offer a history at the time of my
encounter.
Therefore, the following history is per the primary team, the
medical record, and the pt's daughter.

She had been in her usual state of health until approximately
1440 today. At that time, she was sitting in her wheelchair
[**Location (un) 1131**] the newspaper when her daughter suddenly saw the pt's
right arm moving abnormally (not clear if rhythmically). The
pt's
face appeared ""contorted"" and her eyes were clamped closed. Her
extremities appeared turned in and clinched together except for
her right arm that was moving abnormally for an uncertain amount
of time. Her daughter had never witnessed such an event in the
past. She became concerned and called EMS who brought the pt to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Code stroke was called at 1530 and neurology was
immediately at the bedside. NIHSS was documented as follows:


Past Medical History:
-multiple strokes, most significant event around 10 years ago
with resultant left hemiparesis. Has been wheelchair bound since
that time.
-atrial fibrillation, warfarin was discontinued 10 days PTA for
supratherapeutic level
-history of congenital heart defect (unclear of exact etiology)
-nephrolithiasis
-history of blood clot in small bowel
-congestive heart failure, EF unknown


Social History:
 Lives with daughter wheelchair bound at baseline.
Dependent on others for ADLs. No history of tobacco, alcohol,
illicit drug use.

Radiologic Data:

No evidence of hemorrhage or evolving infarction.


Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is an 87 year old woman with history of
right MCA stroke who was admitted with signs and symptoms
consistent with seizure activity potentially related to a new
cerebral infarct whose course was complicated by asystolic
arrrest, and anoxic brain injury.

1.) Neurologically, as mentioned above patient has history of
right MCA stroke with residual left hemiplegia.  Differential
for her acute mental status change included seizure, infectious,
metabolic, cardioembolic with clot dissolution.  An MRI an acute
ischemic event to left insula and the left parietotemporal lobe.
 An EEG showed encephalopathy and frequent posterior
temporal-occipital sharp and slow wave discharges but no clear
seizure activity.  There were no witnessed convulsive seizures
during the admission.  As the patient had a good clinical
description and reason for seizure focus, she was started on
Keppra 500IV [**Hospital1 **] and increased up to 750mg [**Hospital1 **] after 72 hours.
Fasting lipid profile was acceptable and was not started on
statin.  She was normotensive.  Her mental status did not
improve significantly during the admission.  She continued to be
largely unresponsive only very rarely speaking, and never
responding appropriately.  It was thought that she was
debilitated by the old right hemisphere infarct combined with
the new left sided infarct.  As her quality of life prior to
admission was questionable, her daughter requested palliative
care involvement.  Patient's UTI undergoing treatment and recent
acute stroke were discussed with palliative care.  After
discussing with palliative care, the daughter requested
continuing all non invasive medical care to see if there would
be any improvement.  On [**6-17**], the daughter requested a trial of
tube feeds for 12-24 hours to see if this would improve the
patient's strength and ability to interact.  ON [**6-18**] she
requested that the tube feeds be continued throughout the
weekend.  Repeat CT [**6-18**] showed evolving infarct in the
distribution seen on MRI, and no new processess.  A second EEG
study [**6-19**] showed continued intermittent spike/waves from the
area of the old infarct, but no epileptiform activity.  Her
course was further complicated as she suffered an asystolic
arrest on [**2173-6-22**] which was of unclear etiology but could relate
to depressed mental status with resulting aspiration
pneumonia/pneumonitis.  Following this event she was transferred
to the MICU team, however she recovered no meaningful neurologic
function.  In discussions with her daughter following the
arrest, her code status was confirmed to be DNR. Her GCS and
brainstem function over 3 days were consistent with very poor
prognosis for recovery.  She could not complete an apnea test
secondary to abrupt development of hypotension that recovered
following early termination of the test.  EEG showed no cortical
activity at 30 minutes.  Cerebral blood flow studies revealed a
trace amount of blood flow.  Ultimately, the patient's condition
worsened and she expired.  The family was notified. Autopsy was
declined.  Arrangements were made for the patient to be flown to
[**Country **] for burial arrangements.

.
Patient has history of afib and was subtherapeutic on admission.
 Telemetry showed intermittent afib/flutter.  She was ruled out
for MI with 3 consecutive cardiac enzymes.  Heparin drip was
started and titrated for goal PTT of 40-60, and patient was
unable to take coumadin due to failed swallow studies.
.
Infectious Disease: patient had positive Urinalysis for
infection and cultures grew Ecoli sensitive to ceftriaxone.
Infection was treated with rocephin 1gm IV daily.
.
GI: she failed swallow study on [**6-14**] and she was maintained NPO.
NG tube feeds were initially not started per daughter's request
as patient had previous poor baseline.  However, as explained
above daughter requested tube feeds [**6-17**].
.
Renal: There were no acute issues on presentation, however
following her arrest she developed acute non-oliguric renal
failure likely secondary to ATN.

Endocrine: TSH was normal. HbA1c: 5.6

Disp: As above. The patient was pronounced dead on [**2173-6-27**].

foot osteo who presents with fevers after contaminating his
PICC.  Patient did well for 2 days after d/c on [**8-8**] but then he
became increasingly confused.  He had some mild sneezing but no
other focal symptoms.  It is unclear if the patient has been
compliant with his meds including keppra.  According to his
brother he has had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] MS over the past month and
was found to have seizures.  He claims that this new confusion
is consistent with the patient's post ictal state however he
does not remember the patient having a seizure.  He did note
that the patient fell yesterday and hit his head.  No LOC.
Denies foot pain.  On the day of admission the brother had found
that the patient had unscrewed the end of his PICC.  Upon
observing this the visiting nurse sent the patient to the ED.

Foot swab [**8-13**]:  rare growth of [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course:
.
1.  FEVER:
Suspect Uncomplicated Non-tunneled CVC Infection in the setting
of recent unkept PICC line, underlying [**Female First Name (un) **] [**Female First Name (un) **]
osteomyelitis, .DM2, Etoh use, broad spec [**Female First Name (un) 621**].   VNA history
suggests insertion site vs hub contamination.  Clinical signs of
infx clearing, no leukocytosis. Prior exit site w/o signs of
infx. No evidence of secondary hematogenous seeding thus far
though pt has been on Fluc during last admission potentially
limiting evidence of blood stream infx.  At time of discharge,
no s/s of metastatic disease to necessitate longer antimicrobial
course.   Doubt vertebral seeding w/ CNS extension as back pain
and altered MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] and improving.  No septic emboli
culprit seizure foci seen on recent MRI. No evidence for
endocardial infx. Covered gram + bugs and pseudomonas with
levofloxacin and vancomycin b/c patient had a diabetic foot
ulcer.  Vancomycin was initially started at 750 mg [**Hospital1 **] but after
trough was drawn and found to be 11.3, it was changed to 1 g IV
BID.  WBC trended down and was normal on the AM of discharge,
and patient defervesced on antibiotics.  ID team was aware of
the patient but not consulted.  The patient had a PICC placed by
IR on [**8-15**] and was discharged on a 2 week course of IV
vancomycin.  He was discharged on one month of fluconazole and 2
weeks of levofloxacin. The most significant part of his
presentation again, was that he was non-compliant with home
medications and it was not clear that he was administering his
antibiotics at home prior to this presentation.  We therefore,
insisted he completed his course of therapy for line infection
in a monitored setting.
.

2.  [**Month/Year (2) **] [**Female First Name (un) **] OSTEOMYELITIS and LEFT FOOT ULCER:
Likely [**1-18**] spread soft tissue breakdown [**1-18**] DM2 in setting of
surgical site and recent broad spec antimicrobials.  No visual
changes. Foot swab showed rare growth of [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.  He
was continued on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) **] which had grown out in
prior bone cultures. CRP level was also checked in this setting.
 Patient was s/p first MP joint fusion and rotational flap
closure. He was also recently discharged for [**Female First Name (un) **]
osteomyelitis. He had a surgical incision on the left medial
aspect of the foot near the MTP and a puncture wound on the
plantar aspect of his left foot. Some sutures in the surgical
incision had popped and podiatry removed them.   Foot x-ray was
done, no gas was seen on x-ray. Podiatry was following and did
AM dressing changes.  Also obtained a deep wound culture that
showed some rare growth of [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.  Fluconazole
administration was done with consideration to his elevated LFTs,
which had not been progressive during his stay. His follow-up
monitoring was set up through faxed lab values to ID fellow Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 4334**].  Should his LFTs rise disproportionally, the plan would
be to decrease the dose of FLuconazole in half.
.
3.  Seizure Disorder/MS change -
Rx noncompliance in setting of underlying sz d/o, b12 def, infx,
etoh dependance, trauma to head one month prior to admission.
Pt had decreased mental status at time of admission.  By report
of the brother, the patient's MS was c/w his post ictal state.
Furthermore, he fell 1 day prior to admission for unexplained
reasons.  A head CT was negative.  His mental status changes may
have been due to the fact that he had questionable compliance
with his seizure medications.  Also, he had an alcohol history
but denied recent use.  Other etiologies for MS changes included
dehydration and infection. He was continued on keppra at 1000 mg
[**Hospital1 **] at admission.  However, because of his questionable
compliance with meds prior to admission he was re-started on
neuro protocol dosing of keppra.  He was to follow this dosing
schedule at discharge: (750 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 5 days ([**8-15**]- [**8-19**]), 1000 mg
[**Hospital1 **] x 5 days ([**8-20**]- [**8-24**]), then 1000 mg QAM, 1500 mg QPM (final
dose).  He was also started on an MVI, thiamine and folate for
possible vitamin deficiencies secondary to ETOH abuse.
Furthermore he was started on B12 injections 1000 mcg qweek x 4
weeks and then q month after.
.
4.  Abnl Liver transaminases w/ cholestatic picture:
Potential intrahepatic cholestasis from Rx in setting of [**Month/Day (4) **]
biliary epithelial damage from HCV. Patient has HCV and had
increased LFTs at his last admission with unasyn.  LFTs trended
down from admission during this stay and he had a normal
abdominal exam. He was discharged with instructions to check
LFTs once a week while on fluconazole.

.
5. Acute Renal Failure - Patient had Cr 1.7 at admit.  IVF was
given and Ace inhibitor and metformin were held. Cr went down to
1 and home dose lisinopril 5 mg qd was started and Cr remained
stable. He was also re-started on metformin prior to discharge.
Cr at d/c was 1.1.
.
6. DM - Metformin was initially held.  His sugars were elevated
during the day on RISS.  He was re-started on metformin prior to
d/c and sugars stabilized.
.
7. HTN - BPs were stable but slightly elevated.  Started
lisinopril 5 mg PO qd today after Cr was back to 1 and bps were
subsequently normal.
.
8. Lower Back Pain - Continued oxycodone and avoided percocet
because of transaminitis and b/c we were following fever curve.
.
9. Access - Patient was a difficult stick. PICC placed by IR on
[**2141-8-15**].

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1356**] is a 50 y.o. man DM and HTN with a left foot diabetic
ulcer who presented to the ED after being discharged the same
day from [**Hospital1 18**] and developing fevers up to 103 on the way to
rehab.

His recent history is significant for an admission from [**7-25**] to
[**8-8**] for left foot osteomyelitis for which he was treated with
vancomycin and fluconazole.  He was re-admitted from [**8-12**] to [**8-17**]
with fevers thought to be due to a PICC line infection.  His
PICC was replaced and he was re-started on vancomycin, continued
on his fluconazole, and started on a two week course of
levofloxacin.  On his way to rehab on [**8-18**] he developed fevers to
103 and chills and re-presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  He endorsed
fatigue but no other complaints.

In the ED he was febrile to 102.8 and started on Vanco, Levo,
and Flagyl. Overnight, his SBP dropped into the 80s and after
receiving 5-6 L NS he was started on peripheral dopamine gtt
with response.  He was initially admitted to the MICU and
started on broad spectrum antibiotics (caspofungin for [**Female First Name (un) **],
ceftazidime for h/o pseudomonas infection, vanco for MSRA).  He
was also started on flagyl for complaints of increasing diarrhea
and leukocytosis (c.diff positive on [**8-18**]).  He required pressor
support for some time and was also started on
hydrocort/fludrocort for a low random cortisol (9.2).

are noted throughout the visualized soft tissues. A large
plantar spur is unchanged. No new fracture, dislocation, or bone
destruction.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 y.o. man with DM, HTN, h/o [**Month/Day (2) **] left foot ulcer who
presented to the ED with fevers and hypotension.

1. Sepsis/ID:
He was initially admitted to the MICU due to hypotension and
concern for septic shock.  He was initially started on broad
spectrum antibiotics (ceftazidime, caspofungin, and vancomycin).
 A stool sample was positive for c. difficile and he was started
on metronidazole as well.  His leukocytosis on admission (34.7)
also seemed consistent with c. difficile colitis.  Initially he
needed blood pressure support with pressor agents and was
started on hydrocortisone/fludrocortisone due to a low random
cortisol. After his blood pressure stablized off pressor agents
he was transferred to the regular floor on [**8-20**] and he remained
hemodynamically stable and afebrile until discharge on [**8-22**].  He
was weaned off both hydrocortisone and fludricortisone and his
blood pressure remained stable.  He was discharged with
instructions and prescriptions to complete a 14 day course of
flagyl 500 tid and a 30 day course of fluconazole 400 qd.  He
has a follow up appointment in the [**Hospital **] clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4334**] on
[**8-24**].

2. Left foot ulcer:
Podiatry was contact[**Name (NI) **] about the management of his [**Name (NI) **] foot
ulcer and thought there were no acute issues to address during
his hospitalization.  He had daily dressing changes and did an
excellent job of staying off his feet and elevating his foot
whenever possible.  He was given a prescription to complete a 30
day course of fluconazole 400 qd and has a follow up appointment
with his podiatrist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**9-4**].

3. Diabetes Mellitus:
This was initially controlled with an insulin drip in the MICU.
When he was transferred to the floor he was started on his home
dose of metformin 500 [**Hospital1 **] and was put on a sliding scale. His
lisinopril 5 mg qd was also re-started.  His blood sugar control
was adequate on this regimen and he was encouraged to follow up
on this issue with his PCP.

4. Acute Renal Failure:
His creatinine was elevated initially in the ED (2.2) but
returned to his baseline (0.9) with hydration and this was
thought to be due mostly to a pre-renal state.  He was
encouraged to maintain an adequate po intake.

5. Seizures:
He had no episodes of seizure activity during this hospital
stay.  He was maintained on his keppra and encouraged to follow
up with neurology at some point in the future.

7. Disposition:
He was initially planning to go to a rehab facility but felt
increasingly stronger throughout his hospital stay and elected
to go home to stay with his brother.  [**Name (NI) **] also was anxious to get
home as he was unable to find a bag with multiple personal items
that he had with him when he came to the ED.  Social work was
contact[**Name (NI) **] about this issue but his bag was not found by the time
of discharge.  He was given several phone numbers to call to
follow up on finding his bag.
At the time of discharge, he had follow up appointments arranged
with infectious disease, podiatry, and his PCP.

Service:  CORONARY INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

                    ADDENDUM

HOSPITAL COURSE:  For the remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
stay, her primary issues related to her pulmonary status.
Specifically the patient had been initially transferred to
the General Medicine Floor but became hypoxic, tachypneic,
and dyspneic.  This was thought likely to be secondary to
mucous plugging and increased secretions with an element of
cardiac ischemia compounded by abnormal chest wall mechanics
and anxiety.  She was transferred back to the Coronary
Intensive Care Unit for management of her secretions and
closer monitoring.

In order to improve her pulmonary status, we initiated nasal
BIPAP with good results.  We also instituted a beta-blocker
in order to address the possibility of ischemia.  Finally we
added Lasix at 20 mg p.o. q.d. for diuresis in case an
element of her dyspnea was being caused by pulmonary edema.
All of these measures together succeeded in improving her
pulmonary status dramatically, and on [**5-11**] she was again
transferred to the General Medicine Floor where she did well.

We continued her Flovent and nebulized Albuterol and
Atrovent.  We also continued her on Prednisone for suspected
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare and tapered this
over the remainder of her hospitalization.  On the day of
discharge she was still on 10 mg Prednisone p.o. q.d., and
this should be tapered over the next week.  Finally we
continued her Levaquin for a 2-day course for presumed
pneumonia, and a 5-day course of Fluconazole for tracheal
candidiasis which had been noted on bronchoscopy.  To help
manage her secretions, we instituted an aggressive program of
chest physical therapy.

Finally to address her anxiety, we started a course of
low-dose Ativan which seemed to help with her tachypnea and
sensations of respiratory distress.

From a cardiac perspective, we continued Aspirin and Plavix.
We changed her Captopril to Zestril 20 mg p.o. q.d.  As
mentioned above, we initiated Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.  Finally
we discontinued Diltiazem and changed this to Lopressor 15 mg
p.o. t.i.d.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Tylenol
325-650 mg p.o. q.4-6 hours p.r.n., Flovent 110 mcg 2 puffs
inhaled b.i.d., Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. last dose on
[**5-13**], Ambien 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n., Protonix 40 mg p.o.
q.24 hours last dose [**5-19**], Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Calcium Carbonate 500 mg p.o. t.i.d., Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
last dose [**5-28**], Prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.d. on [**5-13**] and
[**5-14**], 5 mg p.o. q.d. on [**5-15**] and [**5-16**] and [**5-17**], no
Prednisone on [**5-18**], 5 mg p.o. on [**5-19**], then
discontinue, Ambien 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n., Lasix 20 mg p.o.
q.d., Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d., Zestril 20 mg p.o. q.d.,
Albuterol MDI 2 puffs inhaled q.i.d. and q.2 hours p.r.n.,
Atrovent MDI 2 puffs inhaled q.i.d., Albuterol and Atrovent
nebulizers q.4 hours p.r.n., Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. q.6 hours
p.r.n., we recommend nasal BIPAP at 10 and 5 at night for
approximately 5-7 days so she can rest her respiratory
muscles for several hours each day.

Service:

This is a dictation from [**2128-4-26**] through [**2128-5-7**].

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
1.  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 78 year-old
female with no significant past medical history who developed
chest pain while driving on the day of admission. She was
found by EMS to be in ventricular fibrillation, she was
defibrillated into normal sinus rhythm and brought to the ED.
In the ED she was found to have inferior ST elevations on EKG
and the patient was taken straight to the cardiac
catheterization lab. There the patient had Vfib times two
while trying to obtain access in the cardiac catheterization
lab. The patient was defibrillated back into normal saline.
She required Dopamine and Levophed for hypotension in the
cath lab.

She had a cardiac catheterization that showed 70% proximal
LAD, 90% proximal left circumflex. She had a stent placed to
the left circumflex in the AV groove that resultant in an OM
dissection. The patient also had a balloon pump placed in the
cardiac catheterization lab and was intubated during her
second Vfib arrest.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for 40 pack year history
of smoking. Otherwise no past medical history.

MEDICATIONS: At home are none. Medications on arrival to the
CCU from the cath laceration include Amiodarone drip at 1,
Levophed at 10, Dopamine at 10, Integrilin drip and aspirin.

ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to codeine and penicillin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone in [**Hospital3 4634**].
She is widowed, drives and is an active woman. A 40 pack year
history smoking one half pack a day of cigarettes since age
15. No alcohol and no family history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On arrival to the CCU heart rate 132,
blood pressure 84/38 with a .................... of 56.
Respiratory rate 21 to 14, 02 saturation 96% on a vent set at
AC, 100% tidal volume 700, rate of 14, and peep of 5. Her gas
on that setting was 7.25, 44 and 142.

General the patient was sedated and intubated. HEENT - EG
tube was in place. Neck - no JVD. Lungs - coarse breath
sounds bilaterally. Cardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm,
tachycardic, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen - softly
distended, nontender with bowel sounds. Extremities - 2+
pulses. Neuro - the patient is sedated but moving all
extremities and responding to pain.

LABORATORY DATA: On arrival white count 9.5, hematocrit 35.7,
platelet count 267,000, 45% neutrophils, 48% lymphocytes, CK
37 and Troponin of 1.2. PTT 24.7, INR 1.2, sodium 141,
potassium 3.7, chloride 107, bicarb 23, BUN 16, creatinine
0.8, glucose 128.

EKG in the field showed ST elevations in T3, aVF that were 2
to [**Street Address(2) 94892**] depressions of about 2 mm in V2 through V4.
Post catheterization the patient had ST depressions in V1
through V5 of 1 to 4 mm at a rate of 125 in atrial
fibrillation.

Chest x-ray showed a Swan in the RV and lateral position. The
ET tube initially too low and the intra-aortic balloon pump
was 4 cm below the top of the arch of the aorta, mild CHF.

Cath results showed a 70% proximal LAD, totally occluded AV
groove, left circumflex with .................... 0 to 1 flow
after the large OM that had a calcified 90% lesion. RCA was
non-dominant. The patient had a stent to the AV groove with
an occlusion of the OM due to spiral dissection.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 78 year-old woman with no
significant past medical history who came in with chest pain
and inferior wall myocardial infarction and Vfib arrest times
three in cardiogenic shock requiring Levophed, Dopamine and
an intra-aortic balloon pump and intubation.

1.  Cardiovascular/CAD - The patient was status post IMI with
a stent to her left circumflex and AV groove with OM
dissection as a complication. Showed a 70% LAD lesion that
was not intervened upon. She was maintained on aspirin and
Plavix. Her CKs were cycled. She was initially on Integrilin
and Heparin which were weaned off. She had no dysrhythmias on
Telemetry. Her CKs and Troponin trended down and aspirin and
Plavix were continued. The patient was also started on an Ace
inhibitors.  Beta-blocker was not used due to her pulmonary
status as described below.

Pump - The patient is status post IMI initially in
cardiogenic shock requiring Dopamine, Levophed and
intra-aortic balloon pump. She had a Swan Ganz catheter
placed and her hemodynamics were monitored while she was in
cardiogenic shock. She was weaned off pressors and the
balloon pump was weaned off on the 23rd and Swan Ganz
catheter was removed once her cardiogenic shock resolved.

The patient had an echocardiogram that showed an ejection
fraction of 45% and posterior akinesis due to the IMI. She
was maintained on Ace inhibitors of Captopril 37.5 tid.
Beta-blocker was held due to her pulmonary status.

Rhythm - The patient is status post Vfib arrest times three,
loaded with Amiodarone in the cath lab and on an Amiodarone
drip initially at one. The patient was ultimately changed to
po Amiodarone.  At the time of this dictation Amiodarone had
been discontinued due to no events of arrhythmias on
Telemetry. The arrhythmia was most likely secondary to the
patient's myocardial infarction.

2.  Pulmonary - The patient required intubation during Vfib
arrest. She tolerated the vent fine and was extubated on
[**2128-4-29**]. After extubation the patient continued to have
significant secretions that were thick and difficult to
mobilize. She was given aggressive chest PT, Albuterol,
Atrovent and Flovent as well as positive pressure vent, CPAP
was tried. The patient was still unable to mobilize
secretions. On [**2128-5-3**] her chest x-ray showed left upper
lobe collapse as well as a right lower lobe collapse on the
28th.

The patient was seen by pulmonary who performed a
bronchoscopy on [**2128-5-5**]. The patient then required
intubation until [**2128-5-6**] when she had a repeat bronchoscopy
and was extubated on [**2128-5-6**].  On the bronchoscopy of note
the patient had very thick secretions with mucous plugging
totally occluding the left upper lobe.  There was also some
note of whitish patches thought to be yeast and the patient
was started on Fluconazole. Of note the patient had been on
Levofloxacin for one week at this point due to a concern of a
pneumonia or tracheal bronchitis. The patient was also
getting Mucomyst via the EG tube during the time of the
bronchoscopy and intubation.

On repeat bronchoscopy on [**2128-5-5**] the secretions were
greatly improved and the patient was extubated. After
extubation her secretions are improved although she has some
persistent baseline atelectasis. She is to continue on
Levofloxacin for 14 days and Fluconazole for 7 days. The
patient will need PFTs as an outpatient and likely need
chronic inhalers. She was also started on prednisone 30 on
the 28th and this will be weaned down to off.

This is the end of dictation for the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
course from [**2128-4-26**] to [**2128-5-7**]. There will be following
dictation to complete the hospital course.

pedestrian who was struck at high speed by either a motor
vehicle or a motor vehicle that hit a pole and struck him. He
is a Spanish speaking male.  There was positive loss of
consciousness and a questionable change in mental status.
The patient was found standing at the scene.

Notable at the scene were right orbital lacerations, a left
open leg fracture.  He was subsequently transported by EMS to
[**Hospital1 69**].  At [**Hospital1 346**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a seizure on the
CT scan table and desaturated to 58%.  He was subsequently
intubated on the CT scanner and further history was
unobtainable.

Abdominal CT:  No apparent solid organ injury.  No free air.

Pelvic CT:  Cystic replacement of the right kidney.

Left lower extremity:  Left talus open fracture; multiple
metatarsal fractures and dislocations.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On presentation, given Mr. [**Known lastname 46623**]
severe intracranial hemorrhages, he was taken immediately to
the operating room with both the neurosurgery team and the
orthopedic team.  In the operating room, an emergent
craniotomy as well as evacuation of the epidural hematoma was
performed.

At the same time, the orthopedic team performed an irrigation
and debridement, as well as an open reduction and internal
fixation of the left foot, metatarsal fracture and
dislocation.

Also, at the time of the surgery, an intracranial pressure
monitor was placed intraoperatively to monitor the patient's
intracranial pressure.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was subsequently
transferred to the trauma Intensive Care Unit for further
management of his intracranial pressure and his other
injuries.  He remained intubated for several days and his
intracranial pressures were controlled. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
started on Dilantin and Mannitol was used to keep his
intracranial pressure below 20.

A repeat head CAT scan on the [**2-25**] did not show
any progression for reaccumulation of the epidural hematoma.

On [**2-27**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] returned to the operating room
for a wash-out of his left lower extremity.  A VAC dressing
was placed.  Also on that day, he was self extubated. There
was no need for reintubation given that Mr. [**Known lastname **]
maintained his oxygen saturation with supplemental oxygen.

On [**3-1**], he returned to the operating room for
another irrigation and debridement as well as a VAC change.
On the [**3-2**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] became somewhat
agitated.  He self-discontinued his intracranial pressure
monitor, all his peripheral intravenous and his nasogastric
tube.  Also on that day, he was transferred to the regular
floor because he was considered stable.

An angiogram of the left lower extremity on the [**3-2**] showed a normal vascular pattern, except for an
occluded dorsalis pedis at the talonavicular joint.

On the [**3-4**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] returned to the
operating room for debridement and wash-out again of his left
lower extremity.

On the [**3-6**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] experienced respiratory
distress as well as acute chest pain with decreased
saturation to 91% and increasing respiratory rate to 40.  He
was intubated and subsequently transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit again.  A CTA of his chest revealed a large
pulmonary embolus and he was subsequently started on a
heparin drip.

His respiratory status slowly improved over the next several
days.  On the [**3-9**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] angiogram of his left orbit
was performed which did not show an arteriovenous fistula. He
was also extubated on the [**3-9**].  It was also
discovered on the [**3-9**] that he was growing
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus from his left
lower extremity wound.  He was started on Vancomycin and
Levaquin.

On the [**3-10**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] inferior vena cava filter was
placed by the vascular surgery service.  He was again
transferred to the floor on [**2123-3-14**].  He was taken back to the
operating room with both plastic service and orthopedic
service for external fixation of his fractures as well as a
lateral rectus abdominous free flap to close the tissue
defect on his left lower extremity.  Postoperatively, he was
taken back to the Intensive Care Unit for frequent flap
checks and he has done quite well with his flap.  The plastic
service is satisfied with how the flap has continued to heal.


On [**2123-3-17**], he was transferred back to the regular floor where
he has remained stable until discharge.  On [**3-22**], all his
antibiotics were discontinued, including Levaquin and
Vancomycin.  He had been afebrile with a stable white count
of 10 at the time of discontinuation of his antibiotics.  On
the [**2-22**], he returned to the vascular laboratory
for potential removal of his inferior vena cava filter.
However, on venogram, there was noted to be a large clot at
the bifurcation of the aorta; therefore, the inferior vena
cava filter was left in place and will be permanent.

He was subsequently started on systemic anticoagulation with
Lovenox, dosed at 70 mg/kg twice a day as well as Coumadin.

Throughout the course of his hospital stay, multiple consult
services have been involved in Mr. [**Known lastname 46623**] care.
Immediately, at the time of his injuries, the oral
maxillofacial surgery team was consulted and worked in
conjunction with all other teams in managing his facial
injuries.  Ophthalmology was emergently consulted on
admission for a left retrobulbar hematoma.  The ophthalmology
consult team did not feel that there was any need for lateral
canthotomy and with no obvious ptosis or elevated pressures,
the ophthalmology team did continue to follow him throughout
his hospital stay.

Unfortunately, Mr. [**Known lastname **] did suffer a traumatic injury to
his left eye and the result is that he is blind in that left
eye.

The plastic surgery service has continued to follow Mr.
[**Known lastname **] throughout his hospital stay and has directed flap
care to his left lower extremity.

The orthopedic service has also been very involved with care,
with placement of the external fixation device on his left
lower extremity and the open reduction and internal fixation
of his metatarsals.

Psychiatry service was also consulted initially on [**2123-3-17**] for
evaluation of depression.  The conclusion of the psychiatry
service was that he was not depressed but likely abulic due
to his head injury and maybe mildly encephalopathic as well.

Subsequently, the behavioral psychiatry team was consulted.
Upon their evaluation by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 46624**], she determined that
most of Mr. [**Known lastname 46623**] deficits are neurologic in nature and
recommended a more comprehensive evaluation upon the
patient's discharge, to provide further information about the
patient's cognitive strength and the extent of his cognitive
deficits following a significant head injury.

The nutrition service has also been involved during the
course of his stay and has helped obtain adequate nutrition
as well as calorie counts throughout his hospital stay.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
Per the plastics team, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is to keep his left
lower extremity elevated and non weight bearing through [**2123-4-13**] without any dangling. He is also non weight bearing
for the ortho and plastics team through [**2123-4-19**].
Mr. [**Known lastname **] will follow-up in the trauma clinic, in the
plastic surgery clinic, in the orthopedic clinic, with
neuropsychiatry clinic.
Upon discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname **] will be given instructions for
follow-up with all of these different clinics and the
specific dates he was to attend.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Percocet one to two tablets p.o. every four to six hours prn.
Tylenol 325 to 650 mg p.o. every four to six hours.
Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.

Service:  [**Hospital1 139**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 33-year-old
gentleman with a history of a motor vehicle accident complicated
by a seizure disorder who presents with a left hip fracture after
a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.

The patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident
approximately one year prior to admission.  After this
accident, he was diagnosed with a generalized seizure
disorder.  He was treated with Dilantin.

Shortly before his admission, the Dilantin was discontinued.
One day prior to admission, he experienced a generalized
tonic-clonic seizure complicated by a left-sided hip
fracture.

On [**2124-2-4**] the patient underwent open
reduction/internal fixation of his left hip.  Following this
procedure, he was bradycardic with a heart rate in the 30s,
and he experienced chest pressure.  Of note, this occurred
during a Dilantin load.  Following this episode, he
experienced sinus tachycardia and hypotension, as well as
pulmonary edema.  At this point, he received adenosine
following which he experienced a ventricular fibrillation
arrest.  He was defibrillated with one shock and entered a
normal sinus rhythm.

An initiation transesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated
global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 15% to 20%.
He was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit and was
initially treated with Lasix and a beta blocker.  This
improved his pulmonary edema, but he experienced hypotension
and required pressors.  Of note, he was also treated with
Ancef for six days during his Intensive Care Unit stay.

The Cardiology and Electrophysiology Services were consulted
and determined that the patient's ventricular fibrillation
arrest was most likely due to his receiving adenosine.  He
was gradually weaned off Dilantin and started on Keppra for
seizure prophylaxis.  He was also started on Lovenox for
anticoagulation.  He was successfully extubated on
postoperative day two.  His blood pressure remained low,
however.  He was eventually weaned off pressors, and by
postoperative day five was clinically stable.

A transthoracic echocardiogram performed on postoperative day
five showed significant improvement.  The ejection fraction
was noted to be 45%.  On postoperative day six, he was
considered stable for transfer to the floor.

The patient is now admitted to the [**Hospital6 **]
for further workup.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Motor vehicle accident with multiple orthopaedic
fractures and a pulmonary embolus requiring an inferior vena
cava filter.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed the patient's temperature was 98.8 degrees
Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 80, his blood pressure was
111/59, his respiratory rate was 33, and his oxygen
saturation was 97% on 2 liters.  In general, the patient was
a well-appearing gentleman in no apparent distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the pupils
were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
The extraocular movements were intact.  The sclerae were
anicteric.   Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular
rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezes, rhonchi,
or rales.  Extremities were warm and well perfused.  No
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  The left hip incision was
clean, dry, intact, and nontender.  The abdomen was nontender
and nondistended.  There were positive bowel sounds.
Neurologic examination was nonfocal.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed the patient's white blood cell count was 7.3, his
hematocrit was 37.7, and his platelets were 347.  Chemistry-7
was normal.  Blood cultures revealed no growth to date.
Urine cultures were no growth to date.  Catheter tip cultures
were negative.  Sputum culture revealed normal flora.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed
improving pulmonary edema.

Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2124-2-9**] revealed an
ejection fraction of 45%.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient was noted to be
cardiovascularly stable.  He received two doses of

ADDENDUM:  This is an addendum to the previous discharge
dictation dated [**2123-4-7**].  In the intervening time between
[**2123-4-7**] and [**2123-4-14**], the patient remained hospitalized for
continuing physical therapy and pain control given his free
flap to the left lower extremity per Plastic Surgery.

Between [**2123-4-7**] and [**2123-4-14**], there were no more acute
issues for this patient.  He continued on Lovenox 70 mg
subcutaneously b.i.d. and dangling protocol with steadily
increased time of dependency of left lower extremity as per
Plastic Surgery.

On [**2123-4-14**], with the patient doing well, tolerating a
regular diet, pain control with Percocet and established
protocol for dangling as well as ability to self-administer
Lovenox injections, it was decided to discharge the patient
to home.

Follow-up appointments will be scheduled before as stated in
the previous discharge dictation of [**2123-4-7**].  The patient
will follow-up with the Orthopedic Service, the Plastic
Surgery Service, and the Neurosurgery Service postdischarge.

This is an addendum from the time of the main body of the
discharge.  The patient was ultimately managed over the
following days from last discharge summary to [**2123-4-7**] with
continued physical therapy and occupational therapy teaching
and training.  The patient was cleared for his left lower
extremity dangled approximately five minutes t.i.d. over the
side of the bed and had passive range of motion exercises to
be completed with physical therapy.  The plastic surgical
service continued to assist the patient and follow his flap
as needed.  The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 735**] for continued care of the flap as an outpatient.  He
is to continue having a nonweight bearing status on the left
lower extremity.  He may have weight bearing on his right
lower extremity, however.  He should have fairly strict leg
elevation of the left lower extremity and only dangling
maneuvers can be completed.  The patient's primary care
physician was designated to be Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8573**] of the [**Company 112**] service
for which she should have follow up in approximately one to
two weeks from the time of discharge.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  See Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 735**] approximately one
week after discharge by calling his office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8574**].
Additionally he will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3266**] of the orthopedic trauma
service by calling [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5972**] to be seen in approximately
two weeks from the time of discharge.  It should be noted
that during his final days of hospitalization his external
fixation site was removed from his left lower extremity and
an ace wrap was applied according to his left lower extremity
at the desire and will of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 735**] of plastic service.  The
patient's follow up with general surgery will be to see Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in approximately two weeks after discharge.  A follow
up appointment can be made by calling [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4958**].  The
patient will continue a regular diet as tolerated with
nutritional supplements of Boost t.i.d.

FINAL DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox 70 mg subQ b.i.d. to
continue for approximately six months due to the nature of
his free care and the inability to pay for any blood draws
for Coumadinization as an outpatient.  It was elected to
convert the patient to just Lovenox injections b.i.d. to
treat him for his pulmonary embolus.  The remainder of his
management will be left to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8573**] of the [**Company 112**] Service
with his primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will additionally have
Bacitracin ointment applied topically q day prn to his flap.
He can have Colace 100 mg po b.i.d. to be taken in
concordance with his Percocet 5/325 one to two tabs po q 4 to
6 prn for pain.  He will continue on zinc sulfate 220 mg po q
day, ascorbic acid 500 mg po q day and multivitamin one
caplet po q day.

Brief Hospital Course:
Femoral central line placed in ED. Insulin drip started. Patient
broadly covered empirically for possible respiratory infection
or sepsis with Vanco/Levo/Zosyn.

Coded in ED. We ordered multiple pressors (dopamine, norepi,
vasopressin) to keep his blood pressure within acceptable
limits. Phenylephrine added during his time in the CCU.

Multiple codes (primarily PEA/asystole) while in CCU. Patient
continued to be unresponsive with pupils fixed and dilated.
Family called, plans of care discussed. Early in admission,
patient had been stabilized, family felt full code was
appropriate because patient was so recently s/p transplant and
had been doing well. After family had gone home, patient coded
again (PEA) and family was called back. Attending ([**Doctor Last Name **])
discussed evolving situation and worsening prognosis with wife
and son. Wife in room s/p resuscitation, witnessed ongoing
efforts to stabilize and treat patient.

After several additional codes including many chest compressions
and courses of ACLS medications appropriate to evolving rhythms,
patient's wife agreed that resuscitation efforts should be
suspended if situation did not improve. Patient continued to
re-enter PEA/asystole, and soon expired. Family asked for
autopsy without brain findings in order to find out what had led
to patient's relatively sudden death.

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

This is a 75-year-old woman with a history of several years
of dyspnea on exertion, who had been complaining of weight
gain and worsening lower extremity edema and decreased
energy.  An echocardiogram done [**2101-7-1**] revealed an
ejection fraction of 60% and [**2-1**]+ MR and 1+ A.I.  An exercise
stress test on [**2102-8-31**] had to stop at 6.5 minutes due
to a 20 mm drop in her systolic blood pressure.  She had no
chest discomfort at that time, and she was referred then for
cardiac catheterization.

She has a past medical history significant for hypertension,
breast cancer, status post lumpectomy and radiation therapy
7-8 years ago, neuropathy of feet, thyroid surgery, and a
hysterectomy.

She has drug allergies to Compazine and penicillin.

Her preoperative medications are Toprol 25 mg po q day,
Norvasc 10 mg po q day, Synthroid 112 mcg q day, furosemide
80 mg po q day, Premarin 0.625 mcg q day, Prozac 20 mg po q
day, and Avapro 300 mg po q day.

Her date of admission was [**2102-10-3**] and her date of
discharge is [**2102-10-31**].

Cardiac catheterization was performed [**9-12**] which
revealed an ejection fraction of 70%, normal left ventricular
function, left main of 30%, 60% disease and 80% disease of
the proximal and mid circumflex and 20% disease of the OM.

Per Anesthesia record, this patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting x5 with a left internal mammary artery to the
diagonal and left anterior descending sequential saphenous
vein graft to the right coronary artery and saphenous vein
graft to the ramus intermedius and obtuse marginal sequential
as well as a mitral valve annuloplasty ring with a 26 mm
[**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **].

The patient was transferred to the Cardiosurgery Recovery
Unit on 0.5 mcg of phenylephrine and 30 mcg of propofol in
stable condition on [**2102-10-3**].

On postoperative day one, patient with a low-grade fever of
100.  Otherwise her vital signs were stable with an output of
4.4, an index of 2.32.  Still intubated with a white count of
15.1, hematocrit of 28.4, and platelets of 139,000.  Sodium
140, potassium 5.2, BUN 35, creatinine 1.6, and glucose of
136.  On physical exam, the patient was following commands.
Examination otherwise unremarkable.  Plan was to try to wean,
to extubate, and to begin Lasix.

On postoperative day two, the patient was afebrile.  The
patient was extubated the day prior.  On [**10-4**], the
patient's white count is 14, hematocrit is down to 23.9 with
platelets of 118.  Sodium 140, potassium 4.2, BUN 39,
creatinine 1.7.  On physical exam, the patient was awake and
following commands with the rest of the examination
unremarkable.

On postoperative day two, patient went into rapid atrial
fibrillation for which the patient was administered
intravenous Lopressor which brought the heart rate down to
70s-80 however, still in atrial fibrillation.  The patient's
po Lopressor was increased to 25 mg po bid, and the patient
was somewhat confused as well.

Postoperative day three, patient remained afebrile in sinus
rhythm at 86.  Physical exam was benign and the plan was just
to continue to observe patient for atrial fibrillation.
Later on that evening of postoperative day three, the patient
was alert, however, confused and yelling out to the nurses.
Haldol was administered, which calmed the patient down.

Postoperative day four, the patient remained afebrile.  Heart
rate 90 in atrial fibrillation.  Examination was benign aside
from the irregular heart beat.  Amiodarone was administered
400 mg po tid.

Postoperative day five, the patient was still in atrial
fibrillation after her amiodarone, and she was started on
Heparin because of complaints of shortness of breath.
Patient's physical exam was benign, and the plan was just to
check the patient's PTT because of her Heparin and to
possibly increase the Lasix for her shortness of breath.

Postoperative day five, the patient was still in atrial
fibrillation on amiodarone.  Heparin was still being
administered at 1100 units/hour as well as Coumadin.  Vital
signs:  The patient's heart rate was 75 in atrial
fibrillation, otherwise hemodynamically stable.  On physical
exam she had decreased breath sounds on the left side and the
chest x-ray showed a left pleural effusion for which 20 mg of
Lasix were given intravenously.  Overall the patient was
doing well with mental status improving.

Postoperative day six, the patient remained afebrile in sinus
rhythm at 70 beats per minute.  Otherwise hemodynamically
stable.  At physical exam she had crackles at the bases for
which she was administered Lasix.

Cardiology saw the patient who recognized that the patient's
last hematocrit was 25, and recommended that the patient
might benefit transfusing [**2-1**] units before she is discharged
and an echocardiogram to confirm that there is no pericardial
effusion.

On postoperative day seven, Cardiac Surgery was called to see
the patient for a low temperature of 93.4 and diaphoresis.
On physical exam, the patient was unresponsive with a pulse
of 58.  A code was called.  The patient was intubated.  CPR
was done and the patient's rhythm became sinus tachycardic at
105.  Epinephrine and Morphine was administered.  An
electrocardiogram was done.  A left femoral CV line was
placed and a patient was transferred to the Cath Laboratory.

The patient was seen by the EP service, who felt that the
cause for the sinus arrest may possibly have been related to
the amiodarone or more likely an underlying sepsis or
metabolic disarray.  So cardiac catheterization revealed
patent graft and the echocardiogram revealed by report,
circumferential pericardial effusion with clot.  However, no
tamponade and preserved or nearly preserved left ventricular
function.  The plan was to place a temporary screw in the
pacemaker to guard against future sinus arrests while workup
of the underlying cause is performed.  On [**10-11**], the
temporary pacemaker was inserted.

The patient became progressively hypotensive during the
procedure requiring increased amounts of dopamine and
Neo-Synephrine.  The heart borders were without change.
Estimated blood loss was around 300 cc with very high right
pressures and minimal urine output during the case.  They
recommended to recheck the hematocrit and transfuse 2 units
of packed red blood cells, recheck the echocardiogram if the
patient still required high level pressors, to check blood
cultures, and to give one dose of Vancomycin for the
pacemaker.  They also recommended to hold the amiodarone, and
Coumadin, and to get a chest x-ray on arrival to the unit.

The patient was then transferred to the CCU following the
cardiac catheterization laboratory on dopamine and
Neo-Synephrine with an intra-aortic balloon pump in place as
well as a RV pacer wire in place.  Patient was in metabolic
acidosis, which was treated by bicarb, which improved her
acidosis.  She still had an elevated white blood count, and
received Vancomycin, Flagyl, and Levo.  That night blood
cultures were sent.  Her urine output was low with a
creatinine of 3 and rising, and on physical exam she was
following commands, was able to answer questions by nodding.

Postoperative day eight, the patient was afebrile on
Vancomycin, Levo, and Flagyl, as well as milrinone, dopamine,
Heparin with an output of 3.4 and index of 1.79.
Hemodynamically stable in sinus rhythm at 93 with an
intra-aortic balloon pump at 1:1.  White count 27.5,
hematocrit of 25.3 with a platelet count of 139.  Physical
exam was benign.  Patient was sedated.  Plan was to try to
wean the pressure support, and to try to evaluate the
etiology of the high liver function tests as well as the
renal failure for which a renal consult will be made.

Cardiology came by to see the patient at which time they
recommended to increase the patient's milrinone, decrease the
vasopressin, to re-echo the patient and to get an ultrasound
of the abdomen.  A critical care consult was called on the
patient and they consulted the patient on [**10-12**].
They stated that her risk of bleeding may be increased given
her balloon pump, but it should not preclude the use of APC.
Therefore, they agreed with the use of APC with that there is
some risk of post-capped bleeding, but with the hope that the
sepsis benefit will outweigh the risks.

Postoperative day 10, 24 hour events included an abdominal
ultrasound that wad done which showed heterogenicity of the
liver, a dilated common bile duct of 1.7 cm, a nodular left
kidney, and bilateral pleural effusions.  Chest x-ray showed
a stable retrocardiac opacity and bilateral effusions.
Weaning off the dopamine drip, increasing the milrinone, and
decreasing the vasopressin, transfusing 1 unit in the morning
and 2 units yesterday evening.

Patient was still on Vancomycin, Levo, and the patient's
laboratories:  White count was down from 30.5 to 27,
hematocrit of 27.6, sodium 134, potassium 4.9, BUN 53,
creatinine of 3.6.

An echocardiogram was done which showed left ventricular
hypertrophy mild, an ejection fraction of greater than 75%,
moderate-to-large pericardial effusion.  Patient still
intubated requiring mechanical ventilation.  Also
postoperative day 10, patient had a recurrence of atrial
fibrillation for which she was loaded with amiodarone and
cardioverted successfully restoring the patient to normal
sinus rhythm.

On postoperative day 11, EP came by to see the patient.  The
patient was off pressors and on a drip.  However, remaining
in atrial fibrillation on Heparin.  Patient had a white count
of 22, hematocrit of 28.  However, with a platelet count of
58, BUN of 54, and creatinine of 3.7, an ALT of 525 and AST
of 123.  EP recommended IV amiodarone at 0.5 mg/minute and to
change to po when the patient is less volume overloaded.  To
continue with the Heparin and to tentative plan to
discontinue the temporary wire, and if permanent pacemaker is
indicated, then we will await longer to fully clear any
further ID issues, and we also recommended to continue to
diurese the patient.

Postoperative day 12, the patient remained afebrile.
Overnight events included having the intra-aortic balloon
pump removed.  The patient is still on Vancomycin, Levo, and
Flagyl.  Vital signs stable however, still in atrial
fibrillation with a heart rate of 101.  White count of 23,
hematocrit of 28.4, and platelet count of 51.  Sodium 133,
potassium 3.9, BUN 53, creatinine 3.7.  Patient was still
sedated and intubated.  The patient was started on the Lasix
drip with good response.

Later on that same day, a left chest tube was placed for a
left pleural effusion.

Postoperative day 13, 24 hour events included an abdominal
and chest CT scan which was performed.  Sputum cultures and
blood cultures from [**10-12**] were both negative.  Chest
CT scan showed bilateral effusions left greater than right
and the abdominal CT scan showed a distended gallbladder with
sludge.  On physical exam, the patient was still intubated
with a hematocrit of 25, BUN 62, creatinine of 3.9 which is
up from 3.7.

Patient's cardiac output began to worsen, decreased from 3.42
to 2.05 with a low hematocrit status post 2 units of packed
red blood cells in the morning.  Patient was started on
Neo-Synephrine again and effusion was tapped status post
chest tube placement.  Still with elevated liver function
tests.

General Surgery came by to see the patient, who recognized
that the patient had a distended gallbladder.  However, no
definitive signs of acalculus cholecystitis.  However, it
does not totally rule this out.  They recommended to not
drain the gallbladder at present, however, they would follow
the patient if any other question remained in Morphine or CCK
might be helpful to rule out cholecystitis.

Renal service came by to see the patient.  They stated that
the etiology of the patient's acute renal failure was most
likely ATN from multiple insults and to consider atheroemboli
since she had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed as well as
vascular disease.  They recommended obtaining urine
eosinophils to evaluate for this and because the patient was
placed on high dosed Lasix up to 80 mg/hour, they recommended
stopping this dose since the patient had adequate urine
output due to the risk of ototoxicity.  They stated that she
appears to require hemodialysis, but if the patient's renal
function continues to decline, hemodialysis will be
necessary.  They also stated they would continue to follow
the patient.

On postoperative day 14, the patient remained afebrile in
atrial fibrillation at 81 beats per minute.  Cardiac output
of 4.9, cardiac index of 2.58 with a white count up to 30.8,
hematocrit of 25.  Sodium 128, potassium 4.1, creatinine of
4.2.  Patient was still sedated and intubated.

Renal came by to see the patient again because of her
worsening BUN and creatinine with worsening renal function
with a creatinine clearance of 15.  They recommended to
consider starting Amphojel today secondary to the high
phosphorus, as well as weaning the Neo-Synephrine as possible
to avoid further renal damage.  They also recommended to
continue daily Chem-7 as well as calcium, phosphorus,
albumin, complete blood count, and Vancomycin levels to
assess the status for renal function.  They also recommended
that she would require acute dialysis within the next 24
hours.

The Thoracic service came by to see the patient, who stated
that the patient may likely benefit from having a second
well-placed chest tube low and posterior as well as possibly
a second one on the right side.  Later on that day, the EP
service performed a lead extraction and cardioversion.  The
lead was removed in the operating room due to concern of
possible perforation.  Bilateral chest tubes were placed with
no significant output after the lead was removed.  D-C
cardioversion was performed.  Patient was in sinus rhythm at
65 beats per minute and they recommend to continue amiodarone
at 0.5 and to change the po load when able.

Postoperative day 15, the patient was still on Vancomycin,
Levo, and Flagyl, afebrile, vital signs stable with a
Neo-Synephrine drip as well as amiodarone and propofol with
good urine output and a creatinine of 3.9 that morning.
Renal came by to see the patient at which time they
recommended Amphojel 30 cc po tid for her high phosphorus.
Wean the Neo-Synephrine if possible to prevent renal
vasoconstriction, and they stated that there is no absolute
indication for hemodialysis today with a BUN and creatinine
decreasing from 72 and 4.3 to 70 and 3.9.  They also
recommend to check the urine, electrolytes.

Postoperative day 16, vital signs stable in sinus rhythm at
81.  Output of 4.49 with an index of 2.36 still intubated
with a decreasing white count and stable hematocrit.  BUN of
73, creatinine of 3.7.  Renal came by to see the patient
again at which time that they thought the patient was clearly
improving from a renal standpoint, however, to continue
hydration.

Postoperative day 17, the patient in sinus rhythm at 90 beats
per minute with an index of 4.47.  White count down to 15,
hematocrit stable at 29, BUN 73, creatinine 2.9.

Postoperative day 18 the patient remained afebrile in normal
sinus rhythm at 88.  White count is 16, hematocrit of 29,
sodium 138, potassium of 4, BUN 70, creatinine 2.5.  The
patient was still intubated.

Postoperative day 19 patient remained afebrile in normal
sinus rhythm at 95 on pressure support with a white count of
16.9, hematocrit stable at 29.  BUN down to 66.  Creatinine
down to 2.3.  Still intubated on Vancomycin, Levo, and Flagyl
as well as her amiodarone drip.

Renal had been following daily and they had recommended to
hold off on diuresis because she is autodiuresing, and they
recommended aggressive nutrition and to renally dose of the
antibiotics as the creatinine decreases.

Postoperative day 20, the patient remained afebrile in normal
sinus rhythm at 96.  White count is 16.7, hematocrit of 28,
sodium of 141, potassium 4.5, BUN 70, creatinine 2.
Following commands.  On physical exam, alert and moving all
extremities.  Plan was to possibly extubate the patient.

Postoperative day 21, patient went into atrial fibrillation
again for which one dose of Lopressor was administered, which
controlled the rate.  The patient is currently in atrial
fibrillation at 92 beats per minute, afebrile.  White count
of 14.2, hematocrit stable.  BUN of 67, and creatinine of
1.8.

Postoperative day 22, overnight events included discontinuing
all of her antibiotics and increasing her amiodarone to [**Hospital1 **].
Still in atrial fibrillation at 101, afebrile.  Still
intubated on fluconazole.

Postoperative day 23, overnight events included extubation
and the patient's Coumadin was started.  The patient was
still in atrial fibrillation at 91, remaining afebrile.  She
was alert and moving all of her extremities on physical exam.
White count of 10, hematocrit of 29, BUN of 59, creatinine of
1.7.  On physical exam, she had improved mental status.  Plan
was to continue her amiodarone, Heparin drip, and Coumadin
for atrial fibrillation.

Postoperative day #24, patient remained afebrile in atrial
fibrillation at 82 beats per minute.  Physical exam remained
unchanged with a white count down to 8.3, hematocrit of 27.7,
BUN of 55, creatinine of 1.8 on a Heparin and fluconazole
drip.

Postoperative day 25, overnight events included an
echocardiogram which revealed an ejection fraction of greater
than 55% and trace mitral regurgitation.  Patient now in
normal sinus rhythm at 69 with a white count of 7.5,
hematocrit of 27, BUN of 49, creatinine of 1.9 with an
unchanged physical exam.

Postoperative day #26 overnight events included stopping the
Heparin drip.  The patient is in normal sinus rhythm at 64,
afebrile and just awaiting rehabilitation placement.  Patient
is scheduled to be transferred to a rehabilitation facility
on postoperative day #27, which is [**2102-10-31**] in stable
condition.

13. Erythropoietin 4000 units Monday and Friday although the
patient does not take this medication regularly.
14. Clonazepam 0.5 mg p.o. three times a day as needed for
anxiety.
15. Lorazepam, the patient could not recall the dose, but she
also uses this second benzodiazepine occasionally for
anxiety.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for abdominal aortic aneurysm.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient as reviewed in previous OMR
notes has 24 hour nursing care.  She has a remote history of
tobacco use.  She does not drink alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs - The patient had a heart
rate of 80, blood pressure 155/70, respiratory rate 22,
oxygen saturation 99% on two liters.  Generally, the patient
is tired appearing, depressed in no acute distress. She was
alert and oriented times three.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Dry mucous
membranes.  The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.
Neck - jugular venous distention was seven centimeters.  The
thyroid was not palpable.  There was no carotid bruit.  Heart
regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no extra sounds.
Lungs - She had decreased breath sounds over the lower lung
fields bilaterally.  She had dullness to percussion.  Abdomen
- The patient had normal bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Liver edge and spleen were not palpated.
Extremities - She had trace bilateral lower extremity edema.
She had multiple hematomas.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 8.7, hematocrit
30.0, platelet count 279,000.  Sodium 134, potassium 3.6,
chloride 98, bicarbonate 21, blood urea nitrogen 27,
creatinine 1.7, glucose 94.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, no acute
changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Psychiatry - The patient was evaluated by the psychiatry
service and shown in OMR that her Clonazepam was
discontinued.  There were no further psychiatric issues.  The
other medications were not changed.

Cardiopulmonary - The patient had a chest x-ray showing a
small right sided pleural effusion and a left sided pleural
effusion.  She was continued on her antibiotics as described
above.  Specifically, she continued her Levofloxacin and
Metronidazole.

The patient's shortness of breath was initially attributed to
possible pulmonary embolism.  The patient underwent computed
tomographic angiography after echocardiogram showed pulmonary
hypertension.  After having this procedure, however, the
patient was found to not have pulmonary emboli, however, a
thoracic type B aortic dissection was noted distal to the
left subclavian artery extending four to five centimeters.

The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for
blood pressure management and evaluation by Cardiothoracic
Surgery.  The patient was deemed a poor surgical candidate
and in consultation with her family, the patient opted
against having any intervention other than medical
management.  While in the Coronary Care Unit, the patient
underwent thoracentesis which showed a mixed
transudative/exudative picture consistent with both
congestive heart failure and parapneumonic effusion.  Her
breathing was much improved following the thoracentesis.

Renal - The patient initially presented with her baseline
creatinine of 1.5, however, she did have metabolic acidosis.
She received intravenous bicarbonate with moderate
correction.  However, following the angiography, her
creatinine increased to slightly over 2.0.  This worsening
function peaked at a creatinine of 2.1.

As stated above, the patient's shortness of breath resolved.
She was transferred to the medical floor following removal of
her central line.  After titration of beta blockade in the
Coronary Care Unit, the patient was maintained on Labetalol
100 mg twice a day for a target blood pressure initially of
120 systolic, however, because of the patient's slightly
decreased renal function, the upper limit of the target was
set at 130 mmHg.  The patient remained free of chest pain
while on the medical floor.  As reviewed with her family
previously, the patient wished to have a DNR/DNI order
implemented as she will not be a surgical candidate and does
not want to be intubated or undergo any aggressive measures.

The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service who
deemed it safe for her to go home provided that her home
physical therapy be continued. The patient will also receive
continuing visiting nurse care.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Mirtazapine 15 mg p.o. in the evening as needed for
insomnia.
2.  Calcium Carbonate one gram p.o. three times a day.
3.  Metoclopramide 10 mg every six hours.
4.  Labetalol 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
5.  Erythropoietin 4000 units subcutaneous every Monday and
Wednesday.
6.  Lorazepam 0.5 to 1.0 mg every four to six hours as needed
for nausea.
7.  Pantoprazole 40 mg q24hours.
8.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. daily.
9.  Levothyroxine 125 mcg daily.
10. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets 0.3 mg every five
minutes as needed for pain times three.
11. Acetaminophen 325 mg p.o. q4-6hours as needed for pain.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

 1.  HYPOTENSION ISSUES:  The patient was admitted to the
Coronary Care Unit.  Presumably at the time of presentation
we thought that the patient might have been septic as her
numbers were more consistent with a septic physiology as
opposed to a cardiogenic shock physiology.

The patient had an elevated white blood cell count and a left
shift.  She was hypothermic and had evidence of a recent
urinary tract infection for which she was being treated.

However, we could not completely exclude a myocardial
infarction given recent ongoing myocardial infarction;
although less likely.  Other things on our differential that
we were including were adrenal insufficiency and hypothermia
with which she presented.

A sepsis workup was sent off which included blood cultures,
urine cultures, and sputum culture.  The urine culture was
unremarkable.  The sputum culture was unremarkable as well as
blood cultures.  There was one bottle that showed a likely
contaminant.   A chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe
collapse and questionable consolidation.  No evidence of
congestive heart failure; thus bringing the likelihood that
the patient was in cardiogenic shock.

The patient had a triple lumen placed for access and
aggressive intravenous fluid hydration.  The patient was
started on dopamine and later on was changed to Levophed for
blood pressure support.  Despite one pressor, the patient
required pressors for blood pressure support.   Hence, we
added on Neo-Synephrine and vasopressin.  The patient was
covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics; vancomycin,
levofloxacin, and Flagyl with one dose of gentamicin for a
presumed infection.  Cortisol was checked and was
unremarkable.  Metoprolol was held.  The patient was
eventually stabilized on three pressors with an attempt to
wean off pressors and see if the patient would be able to
maintain her own blood pressure.

A conversation with the family was held, and it was their
wishes that the patient not any have further aggressive
measures or attempts of resuscitation such as pacing,
cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or cardioversion.  They did,
in the interim, wish to continue with the intubation and
mechanical support as well as intravenous antibiotics.  The
family brought in the health care proxy, ([**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 53995**])
assigned her son [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Name (NI) 53995**]) as her decision maker.
Despite out continued efforts in attempts to stabilize the
patient and wean off pressors, the patient was not going to
be able to tolerate being off mechanical ventilation or
pressor support.  Per family, the patient was made comfort
measures only and comfortable on a morphine sulfate drip.
The family was at bedside at all times.  The patient expired
on [**2123-10-14**] at 12:08 a.m.  The family declined
autopsy, and the attending was notified.

The patient was admitted to the Unit from an outside hospital
with an external pacemaker, heart beating at 60, and a blood
pressure of 100/60.  Pacing wires were subsequently no longer
needed as the patient's heart rate had returned to a regular
rate without any further need for intervention.  The
patient's family had also declined any further cardiac
measures such as external pacing.

 2.  HYPOTHERMIA ISSUES:  Likely secondary to sepsis.  We
were unable to record any rectal temperatures.  The patient
was started on a warming blanket and concurrent antibiotics;
vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl with one dose of
gentamicin to treat the possible sepsis.  Cortisol was
unremarkable.  On the second day of her admission,
temperature was improved.

 3.  BRADYCARDIA ISSUES:  At outside hospital, the patient
was recorded as having sinus bradycardia up to 33.  On
admission, her bradycardia has resolved, and she had a
regular rate.  Most likely secondary to ischemia and
consequent hypothermia.

 4.  NON-ST-ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION ISSUES:  It was
likely that the patient had a non-ST-elevation myocardial
infarction secondary to demand given her hypotension.
Unlikely acute coronary syndrome.  Heparin was held, and the
patient was given supportive measures such a blood pressure
support on three pressors; Levophed, Neo-Synephrine, and
vasopressin.

Given the patient's elevated cardiac enzymes with a troponin
of 0.15 in the setting of renal insufficiency, the troponin
leak was attributed to demand ischemia and not acute coronary
syndrome.

 5.  CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ISSUES:  The patient's
baseline creatinine was unknown, but chronic renal
insufficiency may have been attributed to hypotension or
rheumatoid arthritis.  Her electrolytes were followed on a
daily basis, and medications were renally dosed.

 6.  ANEMIA ISSUES:  The patient's hematocrit was followed on
a daily basis.  Her hematocrit dropped secondary to large
intravenous fluid hydration and volume given.  No evidence of
acute blood loss noted on examination.  The patient was
stable.

 7.  SEIZURE ISSUES:  The patient had an episode of seizure.
Her blood sugar was checked and noted to be 37.  One ampule
of dextrose 50 was administered and consequent Dilantin
loading was also done.  The patient's seizure activity
resolved, and no further seizure activity was noted
throughout the remainder of her stay.  Likely etiology was
hypoglycemic seizure.

 8.  PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on
heparin subcutaneously.

 9.  CODE STATUS ISSUES:  The patient was made do not
resuscitate/do not intubate and subsequently comfort measures
only.

10.  ACCESS ISSUES:  The patient had a right internal jugular
and left arterial line placed on [**10-12**].

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient expired on [**2123-10-14**] at 12:08 a.m.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  None.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
 1.  Hypotension.
 2.  Hypothermia.
 3.  Bradycardia.
 4.  Anemia.
 5.  Hypothyroidism.
 6.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
 7.  Colon polyps.
 8.  Rheumatoid arthritis.
 9.  Chronic renal failure.
10.  Falls.
11.  Seizure.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  None.

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Admitted postoperative for right femoral
popliteal bypass surgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71 year-old
male with coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular
disease, who underwent an elective right femoral popliteal
arterial bypass graft on [**2177-1-1**] complicated by
postoperative chest pain with ST depressions in V4 through
V6, which were worsening with the chest pain.  He was seen by
cardiology postoperatively who recommended cycling enzymes.
The third set of CKs became positive and were rising with a
CK of 460 troponin of 22.  At that point electrocardiogram
changes had resolved.  The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**2176-1-3**].  On cardiac
catheterization the saphenous vein graft to posterior
descending coronary artery graft showed a distal 95% lesion,
which when crossed with a wire became occluded leading to
fallen blood pressure and cardiogenic shock.  Catheter was
withdrawn, intraaortic balloon pump was placed.  The patient
was intubated.  Catheter accessed then was gained by the left
radial artery and the saphenous vein graft posterior
descending coronary artery was stented, but initially showed
no reflow, but ultimately achieved reflow.  The patient left
the cardiac catheterization laboratory intubated on Dopamine
and Dobutamine as well as Levophed with wide complex
tachycardia, which was thought to be a sinus tachycardia with
apparent conduction or junctional rhythm with systolic blood
pressure in the 90s.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.
3.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2147**] with an saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending coronary artery.  In [**2158**] had a redo
saphenous vein graft posterior descending coronary artery as
well as an saphenous vein graft left circumflex.  In [**2164**] the
patient underwent cardiac catheterization with a total
occlusion of the left circumflex with patent posterior
descending coronary artery graft feeding the left anterior
descending coronary artery via collaterals.  There was no
left internal mammary coronary artery graft.  ETT in [**2174-12-26**] showed an EF of 51% with no evidence of reversible
defects.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease diagnosed in [**2175-1-26**]
status post left iliac stent, recent onset of right
intermittent claudication and an angiogram showing 80% common
femoral artery occlusion.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Diltiazem 90 mg po t.i.d.
2.  Cefazolin.
3.  Lopressor.
4.  Aspirin.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Intravenous Lopressor.
2.  Dobutamine.
3.  Dopamine.
4.  Levophed.
5.  Propofol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER TO THE CORONARY CARE UNIT:
temperature afebrile.  Blood pressure 80 to 110 systolic over
60 to 80 diastolic.  Heart rte in the 130 to 150 range.
Sting 98%.  In general, the patient is sedated and intubated.
HEENT extraocular movements intact.  Pupils are equal, round
and reactive to light and accommodation.  ET tube in place.
Neck right IJ in place.  Lungs rhoncherous throughout all
fields.  Cardiovascular examination tachycardic, normal S1
and S2.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.  Normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities right groin surgical dressing in
place.  Left groin with arterial and venous sheaths in place.
 Right foot is cold.  Left foot is cold.  There is warmth
beginning above the ankle.

LABORATORIES ON TRANSFER:  White blood cell count 20.9,
hematocrit 33.0, platelets 235, INR 1.4, sodium 134,
potassium 4.9, chloride 99, bicarbonate 20, BUN 15,
creatinine 1.0, glucose 385.  Arterial blood gas on admission
7.27, CO2 42, PO2 78, bicarbonate of 20.  Chest x-ray showed
congestive heart failure.  ET tube 68 cm above the carina,
right IJ with swan in [**MD Number(3) 50365**] right, no effusions.  Aortic
balloon pump in place.  Catheterization showed markedly
elevated filling pressures with cardiogenic shock presenting
to laboratory.  Cardiac output 4.41, cardiac index 2.04,
after the intervention changed to an output of 4.58 and an
index of 2.12.  The left heart catheterization showed a right
dominant system with left main with diffuse disease, 80%
distal left main disease with a slow flow in the left
anterior descending coronary artery, right coronary artery
was occluded.  The saphenous vein graft to right coronary
artery with 90% distal stenosis, calcified thrombotic severe.
 Electrocardiograms showed normal sinus rhythm and rate with
normal axis, nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay,
ST depressions in V4 through V6, 2 in AVF.  Post
catheterization there is a wide complex tachycardia at 123
with junctional tachycardia with aberrant conduction, QRS was
172 milliseconds, ST elevations in V2 through V4.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 71 year-old male with coronary
artery disease, diabetes mellitus type two, peripheral
vascular disease admitted to the Coronary Care Unit post
complicated emergent catheterization while in cardiogenic
shock post myocardial infarction arrived to the Coronary Care
Unit on pressors and intubated.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiovascular:  The patient has known
three vessel disease now with a new stent in the saphenous
vein graft, posterior descending coronary artery, which
apparently supplies the bulk of the myocardium given the lack
of flow in the left system, presumably the blood supply by
collaterals now status post right coronary artery stent with
ultimate restoration of flow.  The patient was started on
Plavix, aspirin, Integrilin and was initially unable to start
a beta blocker given the fact that he was on high doses of
multiple pressors including Levophed, Dopamine and
Dobutamine.  Intraaortic balloon pump was also in place for
blood pressure supported perfusion.  On [**2177-1-3**] the
patient was slowly weaned of the Dopamine and the Dobutamine
and had decreasing doses of Propofol and decrease doses of
Levophed with a decreased oxygen requirement.  The aspirin,
Plavix and Atorvastatin were continued.  The patient was
autodiuresing without the need for diuretics or an ace
inhibitor.  At about 3:00 p.m. on [**1-3**] the patient
became more tachycardic with occasional premature ventricular
contractions and then with some runs of 2 to 3 beats.  The
patient then suddenly became tachycardic to 140 and had long
runs of ventricular tachycardia and was shocked multiple
times, transiently regained a pulse, however, degenerated
into V fibrillation and was shocked several times.

At this point the family who was present felt that further
intervention including shock, pressors and ventilatory
support should be discontinued as the patient's original code
status was DNR/DNI, however, the family felt that they wanted
to at least give the patient a chance to see if the coronary
artery reperfusion improved his chances of living.  However,
after seeing that he was now in refractory V fibrillation
they did not want to pursue any further life support
measures.  The code was stopped at 3:57 p.m. at which point
the patient expired.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Cardiopulmonary arrest.
2.  Cardiogenic shock.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Diabetes mellitus.
7.  Status post right femoral popliteal bypass graft on
[**2177-1-1**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Expired.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  To transfer from floor after polymorphic
ventricular tachycardia arrest.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old female
with unclear history of prior CAD, with history of a mass
encapsulating right middle lobe and right lower lobe bronchi
with no liver metastasis, presumed to be a possible
malignancy, unclear brain mets (though noncontrast head CT
showed no hemorrhage or midline shift), who was initially
transferred from an outside hospital for concerns of an aorta
dissection.  By MRI at [**Hospital1 **], she was found to have aneurysmal
thoracic and abdominal aorta with penetrating ulcers, but no
evidence of a clear dissection.  Evaluation on the outside
had revealed elevated CKs to around 2200 with troponin T at
peak 24.  The outside hospital ECG had shown atrial
fibrillation, rapid ventricular response up to 150s with ST
depressions.  At the [**Hospital1 **], on [**2107-1-25**], the patient was in
sinus rhythm without clear ischemia.  However, until the a.m.
of transfer on [**2107-1-26**], the patient had an episode of
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia degenerating into
ventricular fibrillation, ultimately requiring DCCV,
lidocaine, and amiodarone drip.  The patient was intubated,
placed on dopamine for pressure support and then staged with
propofol and transferred to the CCU for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Breast cancer, diagnosed eight years
ago, status post mastectomy.

Triple aorta repair approximately 5 to 10 years ago.

History of CAD with MI in the 80s.

Hyperlipidemia.

Presumed COPD.

Question of psychiatric disorder.

MEDICATIONS:  Synthroid unclear dose, also alternative
medications.  At the time of transfer, the patient was on
amiodarone drip, dopamine of 13, aspirin, and propofol.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lived with retarded daughter and son.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Afebrile, temperature
97.9, blood pressure in the systolic 110s/70s, actually in
the 70s, heart rates in the 120s, respiratory of 20, on AC
600, saturating 100 percent.  General:  The patient was
intubated and sedated.  Cardiovascular:  She was tachycardic,
irregular with a [**3-12**] holosystolic murmur at the apex.
Abdomen exam:  Benign.  Extremities:  The patient has 2+
lower extremity edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  From [**2107-1-26**] show a CBC of 13.2,
hematocrit 34.9, and platelets of 36,000.  Chemistries,
sodium 144, potassium 3.6, chloride 109, bicarbonate 29.5,
BUN 31, creatinine 0.8, glucose 129, lactate of 13.7, down to
6.3, coagulations 13.4, 28, 1.2; ALT 118, AST 319, alkaline
phosphatase 131, total bilirubin 0.7, troponin is 8 down from
24.  CPK has been 2240, 1649, and 566 last.

Echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction of 25% with global
hypokinesis, 1 plus MR, mild aortic stenosis, negative for an
effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Review of systems:
CAD; the patient was admitted from an outside hospital with
elevated CK and troponin in the setting of rapid atrial
fibrillation.  She also has an unknown history of CAD.  Given
her CKs and troponin, the patient was treated with aspirin,
statin, and Plavix.  She was not heparinized in the setting
of a known malignancy with possible invasions to the brain.  She
was not placed on beta blockers given her hemodynamic
instability.  Her enzymes were trended down throughout her
hospital course.

Hypotension; the etiology of the patient's hypotension
remains somewhat unclear during the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
course.  Initially, she was transferred from the floor on
dopamine following a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia,
degenerative ventricular fibrillation arrest.  The patient
initially was treated for a possible cardiogenic insult.  She
was continued on dopamine.  However, the patient also has
fevers and there was a concern that the patient having
possible pneumonia.  As such, it was unclear if the patient's
hypotension was secondary to cardiogenic versus septic shock.
Subsequently, during her hospital course, the patient had
Swan placed, which showed a RA pressure of 10, RV pressure of
30/7, PA pressure of 35/25, and a wedge of 15 with a cardiac
index of 2.9, and SVR of 10.20.  Ultimately, secondary to
episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation and also episodes of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, the patient was
transitioned from dopamine to levofed.  She did continue to
have episodes of hypotension that appeared to be fluid
responsive.  As such, it was felt that the sepsis may then
play a large role on the patient's hypotension.  Ultimately
she remained pressor dependent, until her death on [**2107-2-3**],
at which point pressors had been discontinued for CMO
status.

CHF; the patient had an echocardiogram from admission showing
an ejection fraction of only 25%, in the setting of presumed
cardiac ischemia.  As mentioned above, she was initially
thought to have a component of cardiogenic shock.  However,
her PA catheter numbers did not indicate cardiogenic shock.
She actually did receive a questionable amount of fluid later
in her hospital course for episodes of hypotension.  It was
felt later on the patient was grossly fluid overloaded, but
still is exhibiting septic physiology.  Ultimately, she was
gently diuresed to help improve oxygenation with bilateral
pleural effusions.  This therapy continued until decision is
to make the patient CMO.

Rhythm; the patient transferred to the CCU after following an
episode of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, degenerative
ventricular fibrillation arrest requiring DC cardioversion,
and in addition, IV amiodarone, lidocaine, epinephrine and
bicarbonate.  Throughout the patient's CCU course, she
remained extremely dependent upon both IV amiodarone and
lidocaine.  Initially, the patient was transitioned to p.o.
amiodarone and was attempted to have weaned off of lidocaine.
However, the patient developed several episodes of rapid
atrial fibrillation and also was felt to have some episodes
of sustained ventricular tachycardia.  Ultimately, lidocaine
was continued until the patient's family had desired to
change the patient's status to CMO, at which point, lidocaine
was discontinued.

Pulmonary:  Initially, the patient was transferred to the CCU
intubated following her ventricular tachycardia/ventricular
fibrillation arrest.  She remained intubated in her entire
course until her death on the 29th.  The patient ended up
spiking fevers throughout her hospital course.  Her sputum
was positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus.  She
was initially treated empirically with Levaquin and
clindamycin for possible postobstructive pneumonia given her
history of presumed lung cancer.  Later on, vancomycin was
added when staph was found in her sputum.  Meanwhile, the
patient actually oxygenated reasonably well during much of
her hospital course.  Later on, however, the patient
developed increased oxygen requirements, as she became
progressively more over fluid overloaded, secondary to the
amounts of fluids she is requiring for hemodynamics.

ID; as I mentioned above, the patient spiked fevers
throughout her CCU course.  Initially, she was treated with
Levaquin and clindamycin for presumed postobstructive
pneumonia.  Vancomycin was added later on when sputum was
found to be positive for staph.  In addition, there was
concern about possible line sepsis, so vancomycin was
continued for possible line-type sepsis.  She continued on
antibiotics until the day of her death at which point she was
changed to be CMO.  Of note, blood cultures remained negative
throughout her hospital course.

Oncology; the patient with history of breast cancer, status
post mastectomy.  Upon transfer to the hospital with having
findings of her mass increasing in the right middle lobe,
right lower bronchi.  The patient had an abdominal CT, which
also showed lesions in liver consistent with metastatic
disease.  The etiology of the patient's masses presumed to be
malignant of unclear etiology.  The patient did have a follow
up head CT, which was negative for any intracranial
malignancy, but did show diffuse mets throughout her skull.
No further intervention was made at this point.  However,
given the patient's presumed metastatic disease, this was a
key point in discussions with the patient's family given the
patient's poor clinical progress in CCU.

Hematology; the patient's hematocrit was stable during the
hospital course.  Her platelets remained under 100 and was
felt to be stable possibly secondary to underlying
malignancy.

Renal; the patient's renal function remained stable during
her hospital course.  As mentioned above, she ultimately
found to be grossly fluid overloaded secondary to massive
amounts of fluid required to maintain her blood pressure.

DISPOSITION:  CCU team had underwent multiple discussions
with the patient 's family during her hospital course in the
CCU.  Ultimately, given the patient's presumed metastatic
malignancy, her ongoing arrhythmias requiring a persistent
lidocaine drips, her recent MI, and prolonged hypotension
with essential hypertension, and possible anoxic brain
injury, it was decided to change the patient's code status
from full code to eventually DNR/DNI and to ultimately CMO.
At  07:10 p.m., on [**2107-2-3**], the patient became asystolic and
hypertensive.  She was found to be dead at 07:10 p.m.  Family
was at the bedside.  No request for autopsy.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Presumed metastatic malignancy.

Status post polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/ventricular
fibrillation arrest.

Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction.

Fevers secondary to presumed pneumonia and questionable line
sepsis.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Dead.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course: this patient is a 85M with a history of HTN and
hyperlipidemia who presents with SOB and abd pain x 3 days,
found to be in new onset A.flutter. In the ED s/p cardioversion
(50 J), pt. became hypotensive and hypoxic with a lactic
acidiosis. Soon after transfer to the CCU, he had a asystolic
arrest, he was resucitated and intubated he was extubated on
[**4-26**]. Incidentally, a CT scan of the abdomen shows a left renal
mass c/w RCC.
.
1. Respiratory/cardiac arrest: It was unclear why this occured,
possible secondary to respiratory failure and lactic acidosis.
Initially there was suspicion of sepsis due to an elevated WBC
and complaints of abdominal pain.  However, abdominal workup did
not reveal a source of infection and cultures have remained
negative. The patient was in asystolic arrest for approximately
9 minutes. ACLS was initiated immediately, spontaneous rhythm
was re-established after epinephrine/atropine/bicarb were
administered. HE was intubated and a temporary pacing wire
placed. A follow up head CT did not show any evidence of
ischemic injury. The patient pulled out his temporary pacer. He
was extubated and his respiratory status was stable throughout
his stay.
.
2. Metabolic acidosis: the patient initial ABG 7.39/24/103 with
a lactic acid of 4.3. The etiology of his lactic acidosis is
unclear although it could be secondary to hypoperfusion, as the
patinet was hypotensive in the ED. Other possibilities
entertained were ischemic bowel, given the patients complaints
of abdominal pain also sepsis as discussed above. He was given
bicarb, and ventilator adjustments were made as needed. his
lactic acidosis resolved.
.
3. Presumed sepsis: Patient presented with an elevated WBC
count, was tachycardia and hypotension on admission. He was
started on empiric vanco/zosyn. However, no source was
identified, cultures remained negative and abx. were stopped.
.
4. abdominal pain: Mr. [**Known lastname 14**] c/o of [**2-23**] days of abd. pain
prior to admission. He also reports distension and constipation.
Obstruction or perforation were ruled out and a surgical
evaluation was negative for an acute abdominal process.
.
5.  Left renal mass: CT shows a L renal exophytic mass with
characteristics of a RCC. However, a renal MRI for further eval
on [**2121-4-28**] showed b/l simple renal cysts.
.
6. Pump: No prior TTE on record. After his cardiac arrest, a TTE
showed left ventricle hypokinesis. his prior cardiac function is
unknown. He was started on heparin for prophylaxis against
thrombus formation and for his atrial flutter. He was
transitioned to coumadin on discharge.
.
7. CHF: pt has no known history of CHF, in the ED a CXR showed
signs consistent with failure. It is unclear if this is of acute
onset or has been undiagnosed. The pt. has an unclear hx. of
intermittent DOE.  A echo showed an EF of 30%, however, this was
also in the setting of asystolic arrest. He was discharged on
standing lasix, which should be stopped by his primary care
physician as appropriate.
.
8. Rhythm: New onset atrial flutter, s/p cardioversion in the ED
at which time he  converted to NSR but became hypotensive and
bradycardic. A temporary pacer was accidentally
self-discontinued by the patient. However, the patient did not
have any significant pauses since then. He was started on a
heparin drip with transition to coumadin. His INR was 2.4 on
discharge. EP was following the patient throughout the hospital
stay, they did not feel a pacemaker was indicated.
.
9. Hypertension: At home the patient was on HCTZ. As pt. was
initially hypotensive, antihypertensives were held. While
intubated, pt. became hypertensive and was started on
hydralizine iv which was transitioned to po. In addition,
lopressor was added after extubation. On discharge, his blood
pressure was well controlled with toprol xl and hydralazine. His
hydralazine should be transitioned to an ace inhibitor once his
renal failure resolves.
.
10. ARF- baseline Cr = 1.2, presented with a creatinine of [**12-28**].
Possible pre-renal [**1-24**] to poor perfusion due to hypotension.
After the cardiac arrest his creatinine rose to 4.1 due to ATN.
He continued to produce urine. His creatinine stabalized at 4.
and began to trend down, on discharge his creatinine was 3.2.
.
11. Anemia- baseline Hct of 35. Remained stable without
requirement for transfusion.
.
12. FEN: cardiac diet.

Brief Hospital Course:
The hospital course for this 58 y/o M with sudden onset resp
failure and PEA arrest is as follows:
.
# Hemodynamic instability: Patient arrived on the floor
hemodynamically unstable with BP 60/40 while on dopamine gtt. He
was started on levophed and vasopressin gtt as well, but
remained hypotensive despite being on maximum pressors. His
heart rate was between 80-140's with frequent PVCs. Echo
revealed no tamponade, RV or LV dilatation. The decision was
made with the pts sister to continue medical care, but CPR was
felt to be not indicated.
.
# Resp Failure: Pt was intubated at the scene and was intially
oxygenating well; however, over the course of the hosp day, his
sats fell to the 70's despite being on AC 100% FiO2 and 10 PEEP.
He was found on CXR to have severe pulm edema felt to be [**1-13**]
aggressive fluid rescusitation.
.
# Septic Shock/Acidosis: Source remains unclear, but may be GI
in origin. Patient reeived 12 amps of Bicarb to help correct his
acidosis and was started on Vanc/Levo/Flagyl empirically. He was
also given stress dose steroids.
.
# Distended Abd: Pt was noted to have a distended abd on arrival
and there was concern for perforated bowel. Surgery was
consulted and felt that there was no acute GI process to warrant
surgical intervention. It was felt that the guaiac positive
stool could be a component of ischemic bowel compounded by DIC.
.
.
At 4:50PM on [**2164-1-24**], patient was pronounced dead of cardiac
arrest and resp failure. The discussion was made with family,
who felt that they would like an autopsy. The proper
arrangements were made.

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

This is a summary of the hospital course through [**2185-5-1**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84 year old
female with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation and
atrial flutter, status post atrial flutter ablation done two
years ago at [**Hospital6 **] Hospital, reverted back to
atrial flutter in [**2185-6-30**].  She was scheduled for a
transesophageal echocardiogram cardioversion on [**4-18**] by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] who presented on [**4-16**] with increasing
shortness of breath and generalized weakness.  She noted
recent diarrhea with restarting of Synthroid.  The diarrhea
was watery with four to five bowel movements per day.  She
was felt by her niece to be declining at home with heart rate
in the 120s, slurred speech for one day, decreased p.o.
intake.  In the Emergency Department, the patient was given
Diltiazem 15 mg intravenously and then 25 mg in two liters of
normal saline.  The heart rate is in the 110 to 130 range.
As an outpatient the patient had been evaluated by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] for possible atrioventricular node ablation and
pacemaker placement.  At that time she was complaining of
recent worsening dyspnea on exertion.  A recent
echocardiogram had revealed an ejection fraction of 45%,
pulmonary hypertension and evidence of an old inferior
myocardial infarction.  She was referred for a cardiac
catheterization which was subsequently postponed because she
was found to have worsening renal failure.  She also had a
renal consult outpatient appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1860**] on [**4-14**] and had been scheduled for an magnetic resonance imaging
scan of the kidneys on [**4-19**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] now
referred her for transesophageal echocardiogram cardioversion
with the hope that her dyspnea may somewhat improve with the
restoration of sinus rhythm.

PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY:  Chronic renal failure with
creatinine of 2.9 and 3.8, normal SPEP and UPEP, atrial
fibrillation, atrial flutter, failed ablation, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, rheumatic fever, hypothyroidism, cataract
surgery, gastric ulcer, diverticulosis and macrocytosis.

ALLERGIES:  Synthroid gives her diarrhea and rash.  Weight
150 pounds.

MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin 2.5 mg two days a week alternating
with 1.25 mg one day a week, Imdur 30 q. day, Lipitor 10 q.
day, Nadolol 120 q.d., recently increased, Lasix 40 q.d.,
recently increased, ferrous sulfate 650 mg q. day, Pepcid 20
mg q. day, multivitamin q. day, Lumigan eyedrops one drop
both eyes q. day.  TUMs two tablets q. day.  Fosamax 70 q.
week, Ambien 5 mg q.h.s.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone in the Prudential
Center Apartments.  The patient's niece [**Name (NI) 4134**] is involved
in her care.  The patient has a 42 pack year smoking history,
denies alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died from Anthrax, mother died of
renal failure secondary to hypertension at age [**Age over 90 **].  History
of bleeding gastric ulcer.  She has three to four siblings
with peptic ulcer disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination temperature is 95.2,
pulse in the 110s, blood pressure 130/80, respirations 20,
sating 100% on 4 liters.  Alert and oriented, pleasant.
Clear mental status.  Somewhat jittery.  Moist mucous
membranes.  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Jugulovenous pressure 5 cm above the sternal notch, bibasilar
rales with decreased wheezes on exploration, irregularly
irregular heart rate with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was obese, hyperactive bowel sounds, nontender.  No
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities with no cyanosis, clubbing
or edema, 2+ bilateral dorsalis pedis, femoral bruits.
Neurological, cranial nerves II through XII intact, 5/5
strength in the upper extremities bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Chem-7 143, 4.4, 106, 23, 75, 3.7, 131.
Complete blood count 6.7, hematocrit 41.5, platelets 139, INR
4.8.  Creatinine kinase 84 and 102.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and her hospital
course was significant for the following issues.

PROBLEM #1.  Atrial fibrillation - For the first two days of
her hospitalization, the patient was fairly difficult to
rate-control with intravenous or p.o. medications.  She was
on 90 mg of Diltiazem q.i.d. as well as up to 50 mg of p.o.
Lopressor with heart rate decreased into the 90s to 110s.
Her blood pressure remained stable in the 98 to 115 range.
Electrophysiology consult was obtained.  The patient
underwent transesophageal echocardiogram DC cardioversion on
[**4-18**].  She Subsequently became hemodynamically unstable
with systolic blood pressures in the 60s, with significant
sinus node dysfunction, pauses and frequent atrial premature
contractions and sinus bradycardia with rate in the 40s at
times, with occasional junctional rhythm.  The patient was
given Atropine and started on Dopamine and was subsequently
transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit.  A temporary pacing
wire was placed with plans to evaluate the patient for pacer
implantation once her INR was below 1.6.  The patient was
also started on Amiodarone in an attempt to maintain sinus
rhythm.  The patient's Cardiac Care Unit course was
characterized by worsening renal failure with a creatinine of
5.3, and increased confusion.  The option of dialysis was
discussed at that time and the patient and her niece felt
that longterm hemodialysis would not be consistent with her
wishes.  The patient also decided not to pursue pacemaker at
this time and was transferred back to the floor with the
goals of transferring through hospice.  Over the course of
the next few days, the patient's urine output increased.  Her
heart rate which had been fairly well controlled in the
Cardiac Care Unit now increased again to 120s to 130s.  Her
heart rate remained elevated despite nodal blockers.  The
patient began to recovery from her acute tubular necrosis and
her renal function began to improve.  She began to feel
better and decided she wanted to pursue further measures.
Electrophysiology study was reconsulted and the patient
underwent pacemaker placement with atrioventricular junction
ablation on [**2185-4-25**].  Her pacemaker was interrogated
and found to be working well.  Chest x-ray revealed pacer
wires in the appropriate location.  The patient had
occasional runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.

Regarding anticoagulation, for the atrial fibrillation the
patient had been supertherapeutic on admission, Coumadin was
initially held.  The patient was on and off Coumadin
depending on whether there were planned procedures during her
hospital course.  For approximately one week to a week and a
half the patient was on Aspirin for stroke prophylaxis.
However, Coumadin should be restarted prior to her discharge.

PROBLEM #2.  Congestive heart failure - The patient was noted
to be in mild congestive heart failure on admission with the
diastolic dysfunction secondary to her rapid ventricular rate
and an ejection fraction of 45% on recent echocardiogram.
During her hospital course with her increased creatinine and
worsening renal function she became more fluid overloaded
requiring 5 liters of oxygen for her entire hospital course,
sating in the high 80s to low 90s.  Her urine output did
improve and she was diuresed with intravenous Lasix, however,
the patient continued to have an oxygen requirement.

PROBLEM #3.  Hypothyroidism - The patient's thyroid studies
were checked.  Her TSH was elevated at 8.8, however, her T4
and T3 were within normal limits suggesting a subclinical
hypothyroidism.  She should probably not be started on
Synthroid therapy at this time.

PROBLEM #4.  Chronic renal insufficiency - The patient had an
magnetic resonance angiography which she had been scheduled
for as an outpatient which revealed bilateral atrophy of the
kidneys with delayed emptying of contrast with no hydro or
neoplasm.  Her left renal artery showed no stenosis, and
right renal artery showed no focal stenosis with slight
attenuation, however.  Aorta with atherosclerotic changes but
no aneurysm.  Renally, she is consistent with bilateral
adenomas.  The patient did have a gap acidosis on admission
with a lactate of 3.7, however, this came down over the next
couple of days.  Her gap was felt to be secondary to renal
failure.  During her hospital course the patient suffered an
episode of hypotension with her DC cardioversion and had
acute renal failure and chronic renal insufficiency
consistent with acute tubular necrosis.  Her creatinine was
as high as 5.3.  She had subsequent improvement in her urine
output and was diuresed with Lasix and her creatinine
improved but stabilized in the range of 4.  The renal team
was following and the patient will likely need hemodialysis
at some point, the goal will be to initiate this as an
outpatient, having been induced in this acute
hospitalization.  However, if indications such as irregular
fluid overload require hemodialysis may need to be an issue
in this patient.  The patient had been scheduled for
Perma-Cath placement with this intent for Monday [**5-2**],
however, the patient's creatinine improved in the 3 range.

PROBLEM #5.  Diarrhea - The patient initially reported
diarrhea on admission, however, did not have any diarrhea
while in-house initially.  Stool studies were sent without
evidence of infectious causes initially.  On [**2185-4-26**],
the patient was noted to have Clostridium difficile.  She was
started on Flagyl renally dosed.

PROBLEM #6.  Heme - The patient was noted to have an acute
drop in her platelets.  Upon entering the Cardiac Care Unit
and getting heparin, the platelets dropped from 130 to 150
range into the 90s to 100s.  A HIP antibody was negative,
however, efforts were maintained to keep the patient off of
heparin for the duration of her hospital course.

CODE STATUS:  The patient was made Do-Not-Resuscitate,
Do-Not-Intubate during this hospitalization.  This should be
confirmed prior to discharge as the patient's mental status
has changed significantly during her hospital course.

The patient's hematocrit remained fairly stable throughout
her hospital course.

The rest of the hospital course will be dictated by her
intern prior to her discharge.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with history of Down's
syndrome sent to the [**Hospital1 69**] for
a temperature of 100.3, dark-cloudy urine, and lethargy.  In
the ambulance, the patient had some apnea which resolved
after coughing.  The patient had a recent admission to [**Hospital1 1444**] for aspiration pneumonia
complicated by sepsis.

In the Emergency Room the patient was started on ceftriaxone
and Flagyl and sent to the floor.  On the floor, the patient
became hypotensive to a systolic blood pressure in the 70s.
The urinalysis was positive and the chest x-ray was equivocal
for a new pneumonia.  The patient received 5 liters of normal
saline on the floor, and was started on Neo-Synephrine drip.

Soon after transfer to the MICU, the blood pressure improved.
The pressures greater than 120/70.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient is a 63-year-old male presenting from nursing
home with a urinary tract infection.  Became hypotensive on
the medical floor and was then transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit for further care.  Patient became septic on the
floor and in addition was markedly dehydrated.  Patient
received 5 liters of normal saline while on the floor and
antibiotics with marked improvement in blood pressure.  In
the past the patient had secondary adrenal insufficiency due
to use of .................... discontinued several months
ago.

The patient may have had an aspiration pneumonia secondary to
mental status changes caused by his urinary tract infection.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient's urinary tract
infection was treated with ceftriaxone with the possibility
of aspiration pneumonia.  Patient was started on Flagyl.  In
addition Vancomycin was started because the patient had
multiple cultures in the past that were resistant to
antibiotics including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus.

Patient remained afebrile during hospital course as well as
normal white blood cell count.  When initially in the
Intensive Care Unit, the patient's pressor was changed from
Neo-Synephrine to Levophed.  Levophed was eventually weaned
to off, and patient was hemodynamically stable with normal
saline fluid boluses prn.  Patient eventually no longer
required any fluid boluses to maintain systolic blood
pressures in the 100s.  While in the Intensive Care Unit, the
patient's secretion management improved as well with the
suctioning required every 1-2 hours with improvement to
suctioning of every 3-4 hours.

On [**2102-12-21**], the patient's antibiotics were changed.
Levofloxacin was added and ceftriaxone was discontinued for
the purposes of covering Pseudomonas which grew out in sputum
cultures.  On [**2102-12-22**], a cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation test
was performed.  The results are pending.  The patient had a
random cortisol baseline of 12.

On [**2102-12-22**], the patient was transferred to the medical floor
in hemodynamically stable condition.  Vancomycin was
discontinued and the patient was maintained on po
levofloxacin as well as po Flagyl.

After stable condition on medical floor, the patient will be
transferred back to his nursing home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:
Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Urinary tract infection.
2. Pneumonia versus tracheobronchitis.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Synthroid 88 mcg p.o. q.d.
2. Megace 800 IU qd.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at [**Hospital 9013**], not ambulatory and is a Full Code Status.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Neurologic - The patient was
responsive with pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.
He has baseline mental retardation and only responsive to
verbal stimuli, noncommunicative.  Cardiovascular examination
regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2.  Pulmonary
examination clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell 5.0,
hemoglobin 11.9, hematocrit 35.4, platelets 223,000.  Sodium
137, potassium 3.7, chloride 109, bicarbonate 18, blood urea
nitrogen 19, creatinine 0.9, glucose 107, calcium 7.2,
phosphorus 1.9, magnesium 2.8.  Prothrombin time 14.6,
partial thromboplastin time 35.9, INR 1.4.  The patient
underwent cortisol stimulation test.  Baseline after thirty
minutes 7.8, after sixty minutes equal 9.2.  Blood cultures
to date on admission to medicine floor was no growth.  Urine
culture was no growth.  Sputum culture was positive for
coagulase positive staphylococcus and 1+ budding yeast.
Chest x-ray showed positive right sided lower lobe opacity.
Stool was C. difficile negative.  Yersinia negative.  Vibrio
negative.  Electroencephalographic results were pending.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to Medical
Intensive Care Unit on [**2102-7-27**], with hypotension and
hypoxia.  He was started on Levaquin for community acquired
pneumonia and Flagyl for aspiration coverage and anaerobic
coverage and Vancomycin for Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus coverage as he was seen as a high risk
patient because he was transferred from a nursing home.

The patient was also on Dopamine for decreased blood pressure
in the unit. This persisted as episodic hypotension despite
dopamine and improvement in his pneumonia.  He was seen by
cardiology while in the unit.
Cardiology felt the etiology of his low blood pressure was
likely secondary to sepsis given his heart was structurally
normal on ECHO obtained in the hospital.

The patient was also evaluated for adrenal insufficiency
while in the unit and he was found to have secondary adrenal
insufficiency.  The patient had been on Megace while at the
nursing home which had been stopped on admission to the hosptial,
and this was thought to be the cause of his
secondary adrenal insufficiency.  He was started on
Hydrocortisone.

The patient was extubated on [**2102-8-2**], and was weaned off his
Dopamine on [**2102-8-3**]. He was treated with the intravenous
antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia and positive Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus culture and was transferred
to the medicine team on [**2102-8-4**].

While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient also
had a few asystolic events (longest 10 sec) with atrial pauses
which resolved
on their own.  Cardiology felt that he requires a pacemaker
and the patient was scheduled to have pacemaker placement on
Monday, [**2102-8-6**], however, while awaiting pacemaker on the
medicine floor, the patient again spiked fever and had an
increase in his white count around [**2102-8-5**].  The patient's
central line was taken out.  Cultures were sent.  Foley was
taken out and his procedure was postponed.  The patient
remained on intravenous Vancomycin, Levaquin and Flagyl.

His cultures came back from his central line catheter tip
positive for
Staphylococcus aureus coagulase negative.  Vancomycin was
discontinued and switched to Oxacillin given sensitivity of
Staphylococcus aureus to Oxacillin.  The patient remained
afebrile from [**2102-8-7**], to [**2102-8-11**], and the patient
continued intravenous antibiotics, Vancomycin, Flagyl,
Levaquin and switched from Vancomycin to Oxacillin on
[**2102-8-11**].

The patient while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and
initially when on the medical floor was kept NPO for
aspiration precautions.  The patient was evaluated by Speech
and Swallow and was recommended thick pureed honey like
liquid diet.  Family discussed options including possibility
of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement and felt
that continuing feeds as tolerated by the patient and if he
reached adequate calorie count would be the feeding method of
choice.  He remained tolerant of p.o. intake and will
continue thick liquid honey like diet.

In terms of his secondary adrenal insufficiency which was
diagnosed by the cortisol stimulation test, the patient was
initially on Hydrocortisone 50 mg intravenous t.i.d. and was
changed to 50 mg intravenous b.i.d. while on the medical
floor and will be discharged on Prednisone taper p.o.
starting at 20 mg.

Renally, the patient had no issues.  Prophylactically, the
patient was given subcutaneous Heparin, Protonix.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Aspiration pneumonia.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Flagyl intravenous 500 mg q8hours.
2.  Oxacillin 2 mg intravenous q6hours.
3.  Levaquin 500 mg intravenous q24hours.
4.  Nystatin p.r.n.
5.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Heparin 5900 units subcutaneous b.i.d.
7.  Synthroid 88 mcg q.d.
8.  Prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.d.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up with primary care
physician upon discharge and will remain on oxacillin for a
total of
two weeks following which blood cultures will be repeated.
If negative, the patient will return for pacemaker placement
by Electrophysiology.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient had Down's syndrome,
hypothyroidism, peripheral vascular disease and adrenal
insufficiency.  He came into the hospital to have a PEG
placed as well as a pacemaker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission included a
temperature of 97.1??????F, a pulse of 102, a blood pressure of
98/58, respirations of 20 and an oxygen saturation of 100% on
room air.  The patient was alert but not conversant,
appearing older than his age.  The pupils were equal and
reactive to light.  The extraocular muscles were intact.
There was no jugular venous distention.

The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with no
wheezes, rales or rhonchi.  The heart had a regular rate and
rhythm with an S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The abdomen had positive bowel sounds and was soft, nontender
and nondistended.  The extremities had no cyanosis or edema.
On neurological examination, there was 5/5 strength.
Sensation was intact.  This was a nonfocal examination.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient was recently discharged
from the hospital for treatment of aspiration pneumonia,
during which time he went to the unit and experienced sinus
arrest.  He was discharged and treated for Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia prior to returning
on [**2102-8-23**] for PEG placement and pacemaker placement.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The PEG was placed without any problems on
[**2102-8-23**] and then the patient was noticed to have a
cellulitis around the PICC site, so the PICC was pulled and
sent for cultures.  The tip and the wound as well as blood
cultures did not grow anything; they were negative.  The
patient never experienced an increased white blood cell count
and was afebrile for the entire stay.  It was ultimately
decided that this was a local irritation of the PICC site.

Therefore, pacemaker placement was put off by a day.  The
patient had his pacemaker placed on [**2102-8-26**].  He had some
problems with secretions during the procedure and was sent to
the unit for overnight observation.  He came back to the
floor on [**2102-8-29**] for decreased urine output and decreased
oxygen saturation.

The patient was treated with five days of vancomycin, which
was discontinued due to the fact that the PICC site was noted
to have local irritation, not cellulitis.

CONDITION/DISPOSITION:  At this time, he is doing better with
increased urine output. His oxygen saturation is 94% on room
air.  He is now able to return to [**Hospital **] Nursing Home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Status post PEG placement.
Status post pacemaker placement.
Down's syndrome.
Hypothyroidism.
Status post aspiration pneumonia.
Adrenal insufficiency.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Neuro- The patient was admitted to the CCU following
resuscitation from a v-fib cardiac arrest, after being
unresponsive for an undetermined amount of time.  At the time of
admission, the patient was intubated with profound neurological
deficits including an absent corneal reflex, absent pupillary
reflex, absent gag reflex, no spontaneous movement in her
extremities, and did not show any response to painful stimuli.
Neurology was consulted on the evening of admission, and the
patient underwent a head CT which was negative for acute
hemorrhage.  An EEG was performed the following day which showed
bursts of theta/delta activity and suppressive bursts are all
compatible with a post-anoxic encephalopathy of moderate degree.
There was no sustained seizure activity or clear epileptiform
activity.  The patient underwent a repeat EEG a few days
following admission, which showed no EEG rhythms seen, this
tracing shows worsening compared to the prior EEG and is
suggestive of a poor prognosis. No focal,lateralizing, or
epileptiform features were seen.
2. Cardiac- In terms of her cardiac disease, the patient
underwent an echocardiogram which showed the left atrium to be
moderately dilated, the right atrium is moderately  dilated, the
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Anterior, septal and
apical  hypokinesis to akinesis is present. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed. An exact
EF cannot be determined.  The patient was initially placed on
afterload reduction, but was later discontinued on all blood
pressure medications as she became hypotensive.  The patient was
initially made DNR/DNI by her husband, but this was reversed and
the patient was resuscitated again after an asystole cardiac
arrest on the second day of admission.  The patient was
monitored on telemetry and found to be persistently in atrial
fibrillation, was subsequently loaded and started on IV
amiodarone, resulting in effective rate control.  Her
electrolytes were carefully monitored and replaced to avoid
precipitating further arrhythmias.  The patient's blood pressure
remained stable without further intervention.
3. Pulmonary- The patient remained intubated throughout her
hospitalization for respiratory failure thought to be secondary
to cardiac arrest which resulted in ARDS versus aspiration
pneumonia.  The patient was found to have a left-sided
pneumothorax that resolved with chest tube placement.  The
patient was treated with a ten day course of antibiotics and
blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures were all
negative for any significant growth.  After being intubated for
over one week, the patient was evaluated by surgery for trach
placement, which was thought to be likely difficult and
associated with high risk.
4. Renal- the patient's creatinine at the time of admission was
2.1 and rose to 4.0, at which point the patient also became
oliguric, likely secondary to ATN.  The patient's urine output
eventually improved and creatinine trended down to baseline.
5. Endocrine- the patient had a history of hypothyroidism with a
prominent goiter and insulin dependent diabetes.  The patient
was placed on an insulin drip for tight blood glucose control.
Thyroid studies were sent and returned normal.
6. The patient was started on tube feeds for nutrition, and was
maintained on subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.  In
addition, she was monitored for pain with pain medications
administered as needed.
As her neurological exam remained unchanged throughout her
hospitalization, a number of conversations were had with her
husband and family about goals of care and prognosis.  A
palliative care consult was placed and a family meeting was
arranged which included social work and ethics in addition to
the primary team and palliative care.  It was explained to the
family that further resuscitation would be medically futile and
that the patient would not regain any meaningful quality of
life.  The husband, who was the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy,
decided to extubate the patient and make her comfort measures
only.  The patient was extubated and placed on standing pain
medications and anxiolytics for comfort.  The patient expired
within ten minutes of extubation with her family present at her
bedside.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 67M with h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia, and depression presented
to an OSH on [**9-16**] after being found unresponsive at home.  He
complained of 1 week of weakness, fatigue, and increased
abdominal pain prior to presentation.  On the AM of [**9-16**], he was
found unresponsive by his wife.  EMS found him to be bradycardic
without a pulse, and received epinephrine/atropine and was
intubated in the field.  At the OSH, ECG showed inferior STE and
he was flown to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.  His cath showed clean
coronaries.  He had VF arrest in the cath lab and was shocked
into NSR.  CXR showed large R pleural effusion with ?
mediastinal shift, so CT Surgery placed a chest tube, which
drained >1L mucinous fluid.  He was started on levophed and
vasopressin for SBP 70s.  LVgram showed .  Hemodynamics showed
CO 4.12, CI 1.93, elevated R and L-sided filling pressures (RA
14, PCWP 25).  He was admitted to the CCU for further
management.
.
In the CCU, his VS on arrival were T 97.8, HR 75, BP 98/30 on
levophed and vasopressin, O2sat 98% on AC 700x12/0/100%.
Cultures were sent including pleural fluid.  CT head showed SAH,
Neurosurgery was consulted, recommended MRI/A when stable.  CT
torso was performed to look for infectious source.  NG with
clots, transfused 1U PRBC, started on Protonix gtt.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Shock: Pt had Septic physiology on admission to the CCU, and
the most likely source was felt to be postobstructive pneumonia
and parapneumonic effusion. His CI was high, so his hypotension
was not felt to be due to cardiogenic shock. He was initially
maintained on 3 pressors upon transfer to the MICU service, but
neosynephrine was weaned off quickly. He was given empiric Zosyn
and vancomycin to cover polymicrobial sepsis. Levophed was
gradually weaned the next day, and then vasopressin was stopped.
Levophed had to be restarted for a few hours on [**9-19**] for MAP<60,
but it was weaned off the next day.
.
# Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated during his first PEA
arrest. The R-sided chest tube initially drained a large volume
of mucinous fluid, then drained serosanguinous fluid. The fluid
was grossly exudative with LDH 4000 on a diluted specimen. The
pleural fluid amylase was also elevated, to 3x the serum value.
The Gram stain was negative, and cultures are no growth to date.
His noncontrast chest CT showed a RLL rounded opacity with no
air bronchograms but density consistent with lung parenchyma.
The differential was thought to include atelectasis vs.
postobstructive pneumonia vs. sequestration. He underwent a
bronchoscopy on [**9-18**] with mild secretions and no endobronchial
lesions visualized, and a BAL was sent. His ventilatory
requirements were gradually weaned, however he had trouble
ventilating adequately while on pressure support. CT chest with
contrast showed the RLL opacity was a large mass with
significant surrounding lymphadenopathy and marked pleural
tumor, with possible invasion into the chest wall. Pleural fluid
cytology returned suspicious for adenocarcinoma, and pt was
ultimately diagnosed with stage IIIA lung cancer.  Pt's
progressive respiratory failure was treated with BiPAP and nebs,
but he continually removed his BiPAP, leading to significantly
labored breathing and desaturation.  A family meeting concluded
that BiPAP should be deferred, and that pt should be made
DNR/DNI with a focus on full comfort measures.  Pt ultimately
died of respiratory failure likely due to a combination of COPD,
pneumonia and lung cancer on the morning of [**2191-10-3**].
.
# Altered mental status: She had a subarachnoid and
intracerebral hemorrhage on CT. Neurosurgery was consulted, and
felt that the bleed was likely an effect of reperfusion during
arrest. He had leukocytosis but no fever, and no history of
headache at home, so meningitis was thought to be unlikely and
LP was deferred. Tox screen was negative on admission. He was
able to follow commands and communicate effectively when his
sedation was weaned.  Pt maintained a waxing-[**Doctor Last Name 688**] course until
his death on [**2191-10-3**].
.
# ARF: It was thought likely secondary to hypoperfusion/ATN in
the setting of cardiac arrest and shock. His creatinine
gradually improved to normal.
.
# UGIB: His OG tube initially drained clots on admission. He was
felt to have an upper GI bleed in the setting of heparin and
integrilin in the cath lab, and it was self-resolved. Upon
transfer to the MICU, his OG tube was draining a thick white
chylous-appearing fluid. That also resolved spontaneously. His
CT was reviewed by Radiology who stated there was no evidence of
esophageal perforation. He was maintained on an IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], and
his HCT remained stable for the remainder of his course.
.
Pt was maintained on full comfort measures once a family meeting
concluded that he sould be made DNR/DNI w/o further aggressive
management of his progressive respiratory failure.  On the
morning of [**2191-10-3**], pt died a peaceful death due to
complications of progressive respiratory failure, likely
secondary to lung cancer, pneumonia, COPD and an expanding
malignant pleural effusion.  Pt's family was notified, and they
deferred autopsy.

History of Present Illness:
72 year old male with unceratin PMH presents after being found
unresponsive and not breathing at home. Family reported that
patient had been wheezing for the past few days. He saw his PCP
and was given ?abx and inhalers, had CXR on [**10-31**] with extensive
chronic changes with nodular interstitial changes but nothing
acutely seen. He had been heard wheezing in bed this a.m. as
early as 7:30a.m. on morning of admission. Sometime between 8
and 8:30 a.m., he was found by family to be unresponsive, blue,
and not breathing but still warm. EMS was called. He was found
to be in either asystolic or PEA arrest, intubated in field and
coded. He got atropine x 2, Epi x 2 and was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
where he receivd more epi/atropine, levoflox, flagyl, 1 amp
calcium gluconate, 10 u insulin, 1 amp D50 and ASA 325 x 1.  He
received CPR both in transport and in the ED. EKG showed diffuse
ST depressions. Given this he was emergently cathed. On arrival
in the cath lab, he was again pulseless and coded. Cath with PA
saturations in the 90's with high PCWP but clean coronaries;
this was likely due to a failure of peripheral/mitochondrial
ability to extract oxygen.  He was on levophed and epinephrine
and intermittently dropping his blood pressures to 50's,
requiring frequent boluses of epinephrine.

At transfer to the ICU, the patient was unresponsive, difficult
to ventilate, in shock, and anuric.  He continued to have
episodes of hypotension requiring boluses of epi every 10 mins.
A subclavin line placed for additional access.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2142-11-2**] 12:25 PM
IMPRESSION:

1) Repositioning of endotracheal tube, now in standard position;
however, the cuff is likely over distended.

2) Swan-Ganz catheter tip overlies lateral aspect of right hilar
pulmonary artery.

3) Questionable evolving bilateral upper lobe opacities
superimposed upon changes of prior granulomatous infection.
These findings may be due to acute aspiration, infectious
pneumonia including reactivation TB, or asymmetrical edema.

Cardiology Report C.CATH Study Date of [**2142-11-2**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
revealed
no angiographically apparent coronary artery disease. The LMCA,
LAD,
LCX, and RCA were all patent with only minimal disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right and left
sided
pressures (mean RA pressure was 33mmHg, mean PCWP was 36mmHg).
There was
severe pulmonary hypertension (mean PAP was 53mmHg). The cardiac
index
was elevated at 7.4 L/min/m2. No significant gradient across the
aortic
valve was noted up on pullback of the pigtail catheter from the
left
ventricle.
3.  Echocardiography in the lab revealed normal ventricular
function
and no signiicant valvular disease and no pericardial effusion
or
evidence of intracardiac shunt.
4. Severe systemic hypotension to 50 mm Hg systolic responding
to
boluses of epinephrine.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Non-cardiogenic shock.

Conclusions:
At the beginning of this study, left an right ventricular
contractile function
appeared normal to hyperdynamic. At the end of ther study,
during hypotension,
with high dose epinephrine, there was at least moderate global
biventriculart
hypokinesis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no
mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION:
1. Swan-Ganz catheter from inferior approach with distal tip in
right ventricle. This finding was relayed in a preliminary
report to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4281**] at 11:45 p.m. on [**2142-11-3**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
2. There is scarring in the right apex and laterally in the left
upper lung. There may be increased density in the left apex,
which may be indicative of a developing pneumonia. Correlate
clinically.
.
Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2142-11-6**]
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the extremely severe
encephalopathy. No electrographic activity of cerebral origin
was
noted. The usual EEG parameters for brain death protocol were
utilized.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was a 72 yr old male who was admitted after being
found down for an unknown period of time, with full
cardiopulmonary arrest.

He required very aggressive hemodynamic and ventilatory support
during his first days in the ICU.  Once his shock had
stabilized, formal testing revealed brain death.  The clinical
examination was confirmed at different times by three
physicians.  An apnea test was confirmatory.  An EEG revealed no
cortical activity.

Because the family had obtained a restraining order preventing
discontinuation of supportive devices, his body was maintained
in the ICU for several days after his death.  Monks from his
religion came and performed rituals several times.  After
resolution of the legal issues, we discussed particular
specifics of the method of discontinuation of support with his
family's attorney. The court's guardian ad [**Name2 (NI) 5352**] was present in
person; the hospital's attorney was present by conference call;
the judge in the case was notified and agreed.  All details were
followed: his intravenous mediations were allowed to run out;
several hours later, his heart stopped beating.  The ventilator
was then disconnected and the nasal and oral tubes removed.  The
family and attorneys were immediately notified after the
cessation of heartbeat.  The family was contact[**Name (NI) **] several times.
 No one from the family came to perform post-mortem rituals, so
the CCU nursing staff followed documents (provided by the
family) which detailed some of these practices.  In particular,
the patient was left on the ICU, undisturbed, for a full eight
hours after cessation of the heartbeat.  Recorded chants played
at all times.  After eight hours, he was transferred to the
morgue with the chants still playing.

History of Present Illness:
77m with HTN, paroxysmal afib, CHF with lvh and preserved EF,
PUD presented to VA urgent care on [**11-9**] with three days of
increasing dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and LE edema, with no
chest discomfort or palpitations. He was found there to be
afebrile with bp 115/72, hr 130, rr 20, and spo2 97%ra; his
lungs had bibasilar rales, and his periphery showed 1+ edema.
His ECG showed afib and flutter with pvc's, and a CXR showed
CHF. He was given diltiazem 20mg IV once, prompting a transition
to a-flutter in the 80's, with his bp dropping to 60's-70's. He
was given NS and then a dopamine drip. He became minimally
responsive so was intubated. On dopamine, his bp came up to the
120's and hr back up to the 130's, and he was transferred for
further management. In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was given calcium and
glucagon with little response, remaining hypotensive, so he was
cardioverted with 50 joules, resulting in sinus bradycardia. His
bp was in the 90's on a low dose of a norepi gtt (changed from
dopa for tachycardia and ectopy).

FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in
supine position demonstrates the presence of an ETT terminating
in the trachea some 6 cm above the level of the carina. The
inflated cuff distends the trachea locally by some millimeters.

An NG tube has been placed seen to reach below the diaphragm. No
pneumothorax is present. Diffuse perivascular haze is noted on
this portable examination and the patient appears to be in
pre-edema state. Density in left lower lobe area is noted,
obliterating the contour of the descending aorta as well as the
central portion of the left diaphragm indicative of
atelectasis-infiltrate. Further followup recommended.




Brief Hospital Course:
77m with htn, afib/flutter, chf with preserved ef, prostate ca
s/p prostatectomy who presented with sx of increasing volume
overload, was found to be in aflutter, and became bradycardic
and hypotensive following administration of IV diltiazem
requiring pressors and intubation.
.
#Shock/Pump -- His original presenting hypotension was felt to
be mixed type in nature, with distributive component likely from
the diltiazem (he has had this same response to the same drug in
[**6-/2156**], with similar presenting symptoms) and a cardiogenic
component from baseline heart failure with loss of supportive
tachycardia.  No evidence of sepsis (no fever, tachypnea,
leukocytosis, or evidence of infection).  His baseline cortisol
was normal.  Improvement came with resolution of the calcium
channel blocker's effect, decreasing both the vasodilation and
negative chronotropy.  By the second day of the admission he'd
actually returned to his usual hypertensive state, and his
anti-hypertensive medications were slowly re-introduced.
Following this, spironolactone was added both for his CHF and
for its potentially salubrious effect on cardiac remodeling,
done with an eye towards the subseuqently discussed
dysrhythmias.
.
In addition to this, we felt he appeared volume overloaded,
consistent with his presenting symptoms.  He had peripheral
edema, elevated JVP, and hypoxemia to the low 90's-high 80's on
room air.  As such, the cardiology team actively diuresed the
patient with furosemide 40mg intravenously on days [**1-23**] with a
good response (nearly 1-1.5 liters negative per day) with a good
response in both peipheral edema and room air sats (both at rest
and ambulatory).  To further investigate, a surface echo was
performed with the results above, most significantly an EF of
20%.  This was felt to probably be due to a tachycardia mediated
cardiomyopathy, as he seems to be fairly insensitive to his
tachyarrhythmias.  He was cathed at the VA in [**2155**] without
flow-limiting lesions.  His regimen was changed around to
include lisinopril, metoprolol xl, spironolactone, and
furosemide.  He was instructed to weigh himself daily and adhere
to a two gram sodium diet.
.
#Atrial flutter, fib, and tachycardia -- Probably the cause of
his low EF, he was found to be in aflutter with a rapid
ventricular response at presentation.  This was first treated
with diltiazem, causing the bradycardia and hypotension, then
eventually cardioverted with 50 joules.  Following this, he
primarily remained in sinus rhythm with occasional runs of
atrial tachycardia and rare 3-4 beat runs of non-sustained
ventricular tachycardia.  The option of a flutter ablation was
discussed with the patient, but he declined.  As such, he was
started on amiodarone and warfarin.  The risks and benefits were
discussed of both medications, and the patient understood,
saying he'd continue taking the medications and would be seen
regularly by his pcp for all requisite lab work.  He remained
primarily in sinus for the rest of the admission.  His
occasional atrial tachycardia episodes (hear rate around
110-120) were asymptomatic and without other hemodynamic
consequences.  The plan for the amiodarone is to continue it at
400mg daily for a total of 14 days (to finish [**2158-11-27**]) then
transition to 200mg daily.
.
#Respiratory failure -- Seems to have been mainly from
unresponsiveness with a smaller contribution from pulmonary
edema, more of a not breathing than couldn't breath situation.
He was easily extubated on day two, with intially low O2 sats
(80's-90's) on room air that rapidly improved with diuresis.  By
the time of transfer, he was high 90's on room air both at rest
and with ambulation.
.
#Renal failure -- He seems to have some componenet of chronic
renal insufficiency, based on his Cr of 1.4 in [**2155**].  At
admission, his Cr was 1.6, but rapidly increased to 2.6.  This
was likely due to ATN from his pressor-dependent hypotension as
well as pressor use.  His cr slowly improved over the following
days.  Once stable, more active diuresis and ace-inhibiton was
initiated with ongoing improvement in his creatinine.  On the
day of transfer, his Cr bumped back up to 2.3.  This was felt to
be multifactorial in nature; the prime reason was felt to be
over-diuresis, so furosemide was held ([**2158-11-14**]), with plans
to allow him to re-equilibrate, then start oral furosemide.
Other reasons included an increased lisinopril dose, so on [**11-14**]
his dose was lowered from 10mg to 5mg and amiodarone
intitiation, which blocks tubular secretion of creatinine, thus
causing the apperance of renal failure with no actual changes in
glomerular filtration.
.
#Metabolic acidosis -- Mainly non-gap with a slight gap
component. With high chloride, likely was originally
hyperchloremic from agressive NS resuscitation. Following this,
the acidosis is probably from renal failure with poor acid
excretion.  It has been stable and is felt that this will
improve; the plan was, should he begin to become progressively
acidemic from renal failure, to add in oral Bicitra.  However,
as he's been stable, this was thought to be unlikely.
.
#Anemia --- His hct was 40 in [**2155**].  There was no obvious source
of blood loss. The anemia was stable and is likely a combination
of CRI, hypervolemia, and ACD. This theory was borne out by iron
studies.
.
#Hyperglycemia -- Unclear if stress response, glucagon received
in ED, D5 fluid carrying his meds.  His A1c was only 5.9, and it
was felt he could get formal fasting blood glucose tested as an
outpatient for glucose intolerance and consideration of starting
an oral [**Doctor Last Name 360**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 32 year-old
woman with a recurrent demyelinating illness brought to the
Emergency Room by her parents on the recommendation of her
neurologist for evaluation of behavior changes including
increased sexual promiscuity, increased spending and
report that she is compulsively wanting to have sexual
activity and unable to control it to the degree that she is
placing herself and her parents at risk.  She has contact[**Name (NI) **]
many men by computer and phone.  Several nights prior to
admission her father heard noises in the middle of the night
and found a strange man in the patient's bedroom.  The father
called the police and the police knew him to be a dangerous
the patient left the house unbeknown to the parents and was
waiting outside for a cab to take her to a motel where she
had arranged a liaison with the same man.  The father stated
he had also escorted other strange men out of the house and
is very worried about the patient and the families safety.
She also has had increased spending and has had a progressive
decline in her ability to care for herself including
decreased ambulation.  The other stresses beside her
declining physical abilities was that her fiance who was
bipolar committed suicide by jumping in front of a train in
[**2169-1-20**].  On [**2169-5-11**] she was seen by a neurologist
and an MRI was ordered.  The patient was then referred for
evaluation for psychiatric admission for behavioral control.

PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:  Admission to [**Hospital1 190**] in [**2164-2-18**] for a psychotic disorder with
hallucinations secondary to prescribed steroids.  In [**2158**] she
was seen by a psychiatrist when her neurological illness was
first diagnosed and she started to exhibit disinhibited
behavior and impulsiveness with late night phone calls.  Her
neuropsychologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3085**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  She was diagnosed with a demyelinating
illness in [**2158**], which has involved frontal lobe dysfunction

SUBSTANCE ABUSE HISTORY:  The patient denies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Both the patient and her 28 year-old brother
were adopted and live with their parents in [**Location (un) 38**]
[**State 350**].  She was six weeks old when she was adopted.
She was an average student with no academic difficulties.
Question of history of sexual assault in [**2159-7-21**].  She
graduated from [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3089**] College where she studied early
childhood development.  She is single.  Never married.

FAMILY PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:  Not available.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  CBC and SMA were within normal
limits.  RPR was negative.  HCG was negative.  TSH was within
normal limits.  Tox screen was negative.

MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was
pleasant, well groomed and appropriately dressed sitting on a
stretcher.  Her attitude was cooperative.  Her speech was
articulate.  Very matter of fact with little affect.  Mood
was depressed.  Affect minimally reactive.  Thought form was
linear and coherent.  She denied any preoccupations,
obsessions and delusions except for her thoughts about sex.
She did not appear to have any delusions.  She denied
suicidal or homicidal ideation.  Her insight and judgment
were impaired.  Her cognitive examination was abnormal in her
inability to do serial sevens.  She was able to do serial
threes.  She remembered 2 out of 3 in five minutes.
Calculations and fund of knowledge were within normal limits.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] Four.
A trial of Depakote ER was begun to help with her impulsive
behaviors.  Her family and her outpatient physicians were
contact[**Name (NI) **].  The patient was pleasant and involved in MILU
activities.  She did have a fall on the unit with no acute
injuries noted and fall precautions were put into place.  Her
family met with the inpatient team as well as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3088**] who
reviewed her recent MRI and said that it showed worsening of
her demyelinating disorder, which could be consistent with
her current change in behavior.  He would continue to follow
her.  The patient had no further urges or attempts to engage
anyone sexually and was in very good control on the unit.
She did have another fall using her walker and began to use
her wheel chair more frequently.  She denies side effects
from the Depakote.  On [**5-30**] she complained of an upset
stomach, diarrhea and a productive cough for three days with
some blood in her sputum.  She denied any shortness of
breath.  Lungs were clear on examination.  The patient had an
extensive physical therapy consult and evaluation and further
physical therapy was recommended.

Discharge planning proceeded with the patient agreeing to go
to a brief rehab stay for continued physical therapy before
returning home.  On [**2169-5-31**] the patient was being assisted in
transfer from bed to her wheel chair and had a sudden cardiac
and respiratory arrest.  CPR was initiated and she was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.

In the MICU, the patient was in pulseless electrical activity
(PEA) and was felt to have suffered a massive pulmonary
embolism. She was given thrombolysis with restoration of pulse
and blood pressure while being maintained on vasopressors and
mechanical ventilation. However, despite maximum supportive
measures, hypotension became refractory and the patient died
within 24 hours of transfer to the ICU. The patient's family was
notified of the events and was with the patient in her final
hours.

Cardiac Cath [**1-11**]:
PTCA COMMENTS: The patient was emergently brought to the
catheterization
lab after undergoing cardiac arrest thrice at an outlying
hospital and
again en route to our facility. The patient was resuscitated in
the
emergency room and then brought to the cath lab after consulting
with
family members. Initial angiogram demonstrated proximal total
occlusion of the proximal LAD. Prior to proceeding with
intervention a
40cc IABP was placed for hemodynamic support for during and post

procedure afterload reduction and diastolic augmentation via
standard
technique through the righ common femoral artery.
It was planned to treat the lesion with PTCA and stenting.
Integrelin
was the anticoagulant used during the procedure. A 6FXB LAD 3.5
guide
catheter provided optimal support. The lesion was crossed with a
Choice
PT XS wire into the distal vessel. The lesion was pre-dilated
with a 2.0
x 12 Voyager balloon at low inflation and a Quick Cat extraction

catheter was then advanced across the lesion twice due to the
presence
of thrombus. A 3.0 x 28 Vision BMS was then deployed at 16 ATM
and post
dilated with a 3.0 x 20 Quantum Maverick at 20 ATM. Final
angiography
demonstrated no residual stenosis and no angiographic evidence
of
dissection, thrombus or perforation with TIMI III flow in the
distal
vessel. Patient left the lab on pressor support with Dopamine,
IABP,
intubated and responsive only to painful stimuli.
Conclusions:
1. Succesful primary PTCA and stenting of the RLADwith aa 3.0
BMS with
prior thrombectomy. Post dilated with a 3.0 NC balloon. The
final
angiogram demonstrated no residual stenosis with no angiographic

evidence of dissection, embolization or perforation with TIMI
III flow
in the distal vessel with grade 2 blush.  (See PTCA comments)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Cardiogenic shock s/p cardiac arrest
2. Successful primary PCI of the LAD.
.
ECHO [**1-11**] - Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic  dysfunction with near akinesis of all
segments except for the basal half of the inferior and
inferiolateral walls which are hypokinetic. No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w
proximal LAD/LM disease. Mild mitral regurgitation.
.
ECHO [**1-13**]: Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mid to distal
anteroseptal/anterior/apical. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed. Transmitral Doppler and tissue
velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. No apical thrombus seen (cannot exclude). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
.
Cardiac Cath [**1-15**]:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease due to sub-acute stent
thrombosis.
2. Severe elevation of right and left filling pressures.
3. AIVR and junctional tachycardia with drop in blood pressure
due to
rate and loss of syncrony.
4. Successful thrombetomy and angioplasty of a totally occluded
LAD with
restoration of TIMI 3 flow.
.
ECHO [**1-15**]:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed with global hypokinesis and regional akinesis
of the septum, anterior wall and apex. Right ventricular
systolic function is borderline normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2162-1-13**], the overall LVEF is lower.
.
Echo [**1-18**]:
MEASUREMENTS:
EF 20% (nl >=55%)
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Cannot exclude LV
mass/thrombus.
Severely depressed LVEF.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal anterior - akinetic; mid anterior - akinetic; basal
anteroseptal - akinetic; mid anteroseptal - akinetic; anterior
apex - akinetic; septal apex- akinetic; inferior apex -
akinetic; lateral apex - akinetic;
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
.
Conclusions:
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. A left ventricular
mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include anteroseptal/anterior/apical
akinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-1-15**],
there is no
significant change.
.
MRI/MRA Head [**1-20**]:
FINDINGS: There are scattered, ill-defined regions of restricted
diffusion in the right frontoparietal cortex and right occipetal
lobe, with corresponding T2 and FLAIR signal hyperintensity.
Combined with mild hypodensity on corresponding CT in these
regions, the findings suggest subacute infarction. No additional
areas of restricted diffusion are seen. There is a tiny,
solitary focus of susceptibility artifact in the left external
capsule most consistent with hemorrhagic residuum. No
intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus, or shift of normally
midline structures are apparent.

There is mucosal thickening in maxillary sinuses, bilateral
scattered ethmoid air cells and bilateral sphenoid air cells,
possibly related to prior intubation or inflammatory process.
Fluid is also seen in bilateral mastoid air cells.

IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple right sided subacute infarcts in the right
frontoparietal and occipetal lobes - involvement of more than
one vascular territory suggests embolic phenomenon as the source
of infarction.
2. Sinus disease as described above.

MRA CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]: The major tributaries of the Circle of
[**Location (un) 431**] are patent. There is no area of significant stenosis or
aneurysmal dilatation. The basilar artery is slightly narrowed
at its origin. Irregularity along the cavernous portions of
bilateral internal carotid arteries is most consistent with
atherosclerosis.

IMPRESSION: No significant stenosis identified.
.
CT Chest w/o contrast [**1-30**]:
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: Soft tissue window images
demonstrate several prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, the
largest measuring 11 mm in short axis diameter in the right
peritracheal region (series 3, image 9) and a second prominent,
but nonenlarged 8 mm lymph node (series 3, image 17). The
prominent pretracheal lymph node (series 3, image 18) contains
fat, and is likely benign. There is also a prominent AP window
lymph node measuring 16 x 30 mm (series 3, image 20). There are
bilateral pleural effusions, which are simple in appearance and
Hounsfield unit density measurements. No pericardial effusion is
seen. A density is seen along the course of the LAD, suggesting
placement of prior stents. There is a right PICC, with the tip
positioned in the distal SVC.

Lung window images demonstrate scattered areas of ground-glass
opacity bilaterally, and areas of interlobular septal thickening
at the lung bases independently. No focal consolidation or areas
of cavitation are identified. No pneumothorax is seen.

On the limited images of the superior portion of the abdomen,
the patient is status post cholecystectomy. Within the left lobe
of the liver in a subcapsular position, there is a 3.8 x 2.2 cm
mass (series 2, image 48), which demonstrates density of 50
Hounsfield units on this noncontrast study. Adjacent to this,
there is a smaller focal area of low attenuation measuring 13 x
9 mm. The visualized portions of the adrenal glands, spleen,
pancreas, upper kidneys, and stomach are within normal limits.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are
identified. Degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic
spine.

IMPRESSION:

1. Bilateral pleural effusions, intralobular septal thickening,
and scattered areas of ground-glass opacity are consistent with
CHF and pulmonary volume overload. A superimposed atypical
infection is not entirely excluded. There is no evidence of
cavitation.

2. Several mildly prominent lymph nodes are noted within the
mediastinum, which can be seen in the setting of CHF and/or
infection.

3. There is a 3.8 cm subcapsular mass within the left lobe of
liver, which is not completely characterized on this study.
Further evaluation with an US or MRI is recommended.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 73 year old man who was transferred
from [**Hospital3 4107**] with an anterior STEMI complicated by
cardiogenic shock and VF arrest who was taken emergently to the
cath lab for revascularization, course complicated by in-stent
thrombosis and multiple extubations/re-intubations.
.
# CV:
CAD - Patient was transferred from OSH with STEMI, initially
loaded with plavix, acquired Vfib arrest resulting in multiple
rounds of CPR at OSH and enroute to [**Hospital1 **].  Patient transferred to
cath lab emergently (see results) with stent/iabp placement,
ECHO showing severe systolic dysfunction in anterior septal
region, LAD territory.  Heparin was held post-cath for concern
for UGI due to NGT lavage with coffee grounds in ED with small
drop in hct.  On HD#3, pt transferred to cath lab emergently for
ST elevations in anterior leads, found to have in-stent
thrombosis, thrombectomy and PTCA performed, IABP replaced,
heparin initiated, plavix loaded at 300mg, began 150mg qd.
Concern thrombosis [**3-12**] to inadequate plavix loading at OSH and
while in-house due to lavage and question of decreased PO
absorption.  Patient was continued on his aspirin, statin, and
plavix (75mg [**Hospital1 **]) and also heparin drip over the course of his
stay.  Two weeks post in-stent thrombosis, patient's heparin was
bridged with coumadin, with plan for continued anticoagulation.
Patient should also be continued on Plavix 75 mg PO BID for a
month and then uninterrupted for at least year and possible
longer.  The course at that point should be discussed with
patient's cardiologist.  Patient should continue his Lipitor 80
mg [**Last Name (LF) 244**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 325, Digoxin 0.625 QD, Metoprolol XL 50 mg QD, and
Plavix 75 mg PO BID x 30 days and then 75 mg QD thereafer.
Patient's captopril 25 mg TID was also switched to Lisinopril 15
mg QD.
PUMP - patient found to have EF of 20% with
anteroseptal/anterior/apical akinesis, was aggressively diuresed
on 40 IV lasix and will be d/c on Lasix 20 PO along with
spiranolactone.  He should also be evaluated in [**5-14**] weeks for
SCD stratification with an echo, or alternatively, a signal
averaged EKG and cardiac MRI.
RHYTHM - Patient initially found to be in wide complex
tachycardia with VF arrest with subsequent afib/aflutter and
most recently with NSR with PAC.  Patient's amiodarone was d/c
due to concern for amiodarone toxicity and he was continued on
digoxin.  Patient will follow up in electrocardiology clinic.

# PULM: Patient's airway was initially preserved with intubation
and ventilator assistance in the setting of his cardiac code.
Patient self-extubated himself on the third hospital day, which
preceded his in-stent thrombosis and re-intubation.  Patient was
extubated one additional time with consequent reintubation, most
likely secondary to mucus plugging or decreased respiratory
drive due to remaining sedating medications.  As per history, no
intrinsic pulm disease was found to be limiting his pulmonary
functionality, RSBIs remained below 70 for days.  Patient was
initiall treated for an aspiration pneumonia and then
transitioned to treatment for hospital acquired pneumonia, see
ID discussion.  Due to some blood tinged sputum two weeks into
his hospital stay and abnormal findings on his chest  xray, a
pulmonary consult was placed, with the recommendations to defer
on bronchoscopy and following clinically.  On hospital day 16,
patient was successfully extubated without further complication
or reintubation.  Patient was subsequently diagnosed with MRSA
ventilation associated pneumonia as confirmed by [**1-27**] sputum.
He was treated with 13 days of Vancomycin which was switched to
Linezolid on [**1-30**] for a 7 day course.  Patient was also
empirically covered with Meropenem which was stopped after 7
days after no gram negative organisms were identified.  Patient
remained afebrile although his WBC was slow to improve and
remained [**12-23**] upon discharge.  Patient may have also had a
element of acute amiodarone toxicity which was contributing to
his continued oxygen requirement.  Patient will require further
Physical therapy, spirometry and gradual titration of his oxygen
demand.  Amiodarone as offending [**Doctor Last Name 360**] has been discontinued.
The infection is likely to be resolving as patient remained
afebrile without other source of leukocytosis.  Patient will
need two further days of linezolid.
.
# GI: On hosptial day 1, patient had coffee ground emesis on
nasogastric suctioning, which prompted holding patient's heparin
administration.  Protonix [**Hospital1 **] dosing was initiated.  Throughout
his stay, patient did not have any melanotic stools or overt
bleeding from his uppper GI tract.  While intubated, patient was
given tube feeds when appropriate, initially with increased
residuals, but then with improvement on an appropriate bowel
regimen.   His hematocrit remained stable upon discharge on
30-35.  He was conservatively managed.
.
# ID: Patient acquired a leukocytosis early in his hospital
course with a concurrent low grade temperature just below 100
degrees, save some intermittent spikes to 102.  Patient's
panculture initially returned negative, save diptheroids on a
blood culture.  Concern for aspiration pneumonia, patient was
initiated on levofloxacin and flagyl treatment.  Patient's
multiple sputum cultures returned as MRSA and patient was
treatment for a hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin,
concurrently with cefepime.  Due to woresning chest x-rays
during his course, infiltrative findings in the RLL and LML,
cefepime was changed to meropenem.  Patient was continued on
vancomycin, then linezolid and short course of meropemen as
above.  He remained afebrile throughout his stay without another
clear etiology of fevers.
.
# NEURO: Initially it was difficult to determine patient's
neurological functioning due to sedation.  As patient was being
intermittently weaned off sedation, there was question whether
patient was appropriately moving his extremities and responding
appropriately, which prompted an MRI, revealing watershed
infarcts vs emboli in the right frontoparietal and occipital
lobes.t delayed.  Continued concern for anoxic brain injury,
sequelae from notable infarcts on MRI, or more favorably,
lingering effects of sedating medications.  Patient continue to
improve as far as short term memory and recall, with
intermittent delusions which may have been due to his strokes
and improving ICU psychosis.  Patient was treated with Zyprexa
qHs and diazepam prn.
.
# f/u - patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]/[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
in [**Hospital **] clinic and with his PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] is being d/c to acute rehab.

History of Present Illness:
84 year old male with PMH of CAD, hx MI ([**2134**]), DM, presented to
OSH ED with N/V and SOB x a few days.  EKG showed ST elevations
in V2 with Qs in II and aVF and hyperacute T waves in V3 with ST
depression in V5-6.  Troponin was 15.65 and CK was 603 and MB
was 123.  He also had a transaminitis, a Cr of 1.8 and a U/A
positive for Leuk Esterase and WBCs.  The pt was given levoquin
500IV x 1, heparin gtt, integrillin, reglan.  He was hypotensive
with a SBP of 80-100 s/p 1500cc fluid bolus.  He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  Here he underwent a cardiac
catheterization where he was found to have a total occlusion of
the mid LAD, subtotal occlusions of the LCx, and a diffusely
calcified RCA.  A balloon was passed and inflated in the mid LAD
but unable to pass 80% stenosis distally.  No stent placed
secondary to ASA allergy.  Hemodynamics demonstrated increased
filling pressures with decreased CO/CI.  The pt was started on
dobutamine and IABP for cardiogenic shock.

Cardiac Cath at [**Hospital1 18**] [**9-21**]
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant patient
revealed severe two vessel CAD. The LMCA had calcifications and
minor
distal lesion. The proximal LAD was normal, however after a
large
septal that gave off collaterals to the right, the LAD was
totally
occluded. The distal LAD was also totally occluded but filled
from left to left collaterals (septal to PDA to distal LAD). The
LCX had diffuse non flow limiting disease but the OM1 had
subtotal occlusion and filled from collaterals from the distal
LCX. The RCA was not able to be engaged but appeared to be
totally occluded and heavily calcified. The distal PDA filled
from L to R collaterals.
2. Hemodynamics revealed severe elevation of right and left
filling
pressures with PCWP of 29mmHG and mean RA of 15mmHG. The cardiac
output was severely depressed with index of 1.46 by Fick.
3. Ventriculogram was deferred due to heavy dye burden
4. Successful recanalization of the mid LAD followed with POBA
with 2.0 balloon with significant improvement (see PTCA
comments).
5. Insertion of IABP for hemodynamic support.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 84 year old male with PMH of CAD (S/P MI), DM
admitted with STEMI [**2-13**] occluded mid LAD complicated by
cardiogenic shock on IABP for BP support and PO amio for rapid
atrial fibrillation, unable to be weaned off pressors and
eventually made comfort measures only.
.
Hospital course is reviewed below by problem:
.
1) Cardiogenic shock - As per the HPI, the patient was initially
put on IABP for pressure support post-catheterization but became
hypotensive and was found to have severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**]
0.5cm). He was placed on dobutamine, levophed, and vasopressin.
He was unable to be weaned off these medications, and after a
long course, decided to stop the IV pressors and become comfort
measures only.
.
2) S/P STEMI - He had a difficult PTCA to mid LAD only, with
cath complicated by difficulty passing wire. He was determined
not to be a candidate for valvuloplasty. He was treated with
plavix, statin, and ASA until made CMO.
.
3) New onset atrial fibrillation - This was treated with
amiodarone.
.
4) Infection - He was treated with levofloxacin 250 daily for a
UTI, then vancomycin, ceftaz, and flagyl for empiric coverage.
Cultures never grew any organisms, and the antibiotics were
stopped when he was made CMO.
.
5) GI Bleed - He had guaiac positive stool on exam at his first
cath on [**9-22**], but his Hct remained stable.
.
6) Acidosis - Near the end of his hospitalization, he was found
to have both an anion and nonanion gap acidosis. These were
thought to be secondary to renal failure, with contribution from
starvation ketoacidosis and possibly lactic acidosis. He was
well compensated and only infrequently was acidemic. He was
treated with bicarbonate, but this was stopped when his cardiac
output continued to drop despite the treatment.
.
7) DM - He was maintained on insulin SS for tight BS control
until made CMO.

Brief Hospital Course:
In addition to undergoing sepsis protocol in Emergency
Department, a cardiology consult was called.  It was decided
that patient would continue on amiodarone drip, with addition of
procainamide if continued wide complex tachycardia.  The patient
was transferred to MICU for further sepsis workup, however,
shortly after transfer, he became hemodynamically compromised
with SBP in 50-60's.  The pulse was subsequently lost and a code
was called.  The patient was found to be in PEA arrest, multiple
rounds of epinephrine, atropine, and bicarb were given.  After
ten minutes, the pulse was recovered once and lost again.
Atropine, epinephrine, and bicarb were again administered with
no effect.  Resuscitation efforts were continued while the
patient's parents were informed of his persistent PEA arrest.
They did not want to proceed with any further resuscitation
efforts.  With the family at bedside, the code was called, and
the patient was pronounced dead at 3:51 am.  An autopsy was
offered and declined by the family.

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an 85-year-old
woman with a history of congestive heart failure, peripheral
vascular disease, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and Parkinson's
disease, who was admitted after being found unresponsive at
home.  The patient was in her usual state of health until 1
P.M. on the day of admission, when she was found by her
cousin, who lives with her.  The patient was unresponsive,
apparently no longer than 30 seconds.  She slumped forward,
and EMS was called.  There were no preceding palpitations,
shortness of breath, chest pain, focal weakness, dysarthria,
bowel or bladder incontinence, or seizure activity noted.
EMS noted the patient to have a finger stick blood glucose of
240, atrial fibrillation on the monitor, with a rate of 100,
blood pressure of 136/palp, respiration rate of 4, and
initially unresponsive.  Her pupils were equal, round and
reactive to light.

The patient was intubated and, during intubation, she was
noted to have increased agitation.  She was given 2 mg of
Versed, successfully intubated, and sent to [**Hospital1 346**], where she was immediately brought
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Upon arrival, she was
hemodynamically stable.

She quit tobacco 15 years ago.  The patient had been at
[**Hospital3 2732**] Home for approximately one and a half
months following her [**Month (only) 359**] admission for congestive heart
failure.  While there, she had been placed on supplemental
oxygen by nasal cannula.  She was discharged home on oxygen
one and a half weeks prior to her readmission.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Father died of a myocardial infarction at
age 39.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   Stable four-pillow orthopnea, decreasing
peripheral edema over baseline, stable dyspnea on exertion,
no chest pain, oxygen 2 liters nasal cannula at home, no

rhythm, normal S1 and S2, I/VI systolic murmur at the upper
sternal border.  Lungs:  Decreased breath sounds at the right
base, otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally, without
rales, rhonchi or wheezes.  Abdomen:  Soft, obese,
nondistended, right lower quadrant and left lower quadrant
mildly tender, no rebound, no guarding, positive bowel

screen was negative.   Urine toxicology screen was positive
for benzodiazepines.  Arterial blood gas was 7.55/36/220 on
100% FIO2 with the ventilator settings as listed above.  CT
scan of the head showed no intracerebral bleed.  Chest x-ray
showed bilateral hilar fullness and upper zone
redistribution.  Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at
78, with normal axis.  There were peaked T waves in Leads V2
through V6.  There were no ST or T changes suggestive of
ischemia, no Q waves consistent with electrocardiogram
performed in [**2130-8-14**].

IMPRESSION:   This was an 85-year-old woman with a history of
diastolic dysfunction, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's
disease, who was found unresponsive and intubated in the
field, but whose neurologic function upon admission appeared
to be at baseline.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Initially the patient's primary disorder
was thought to be neurologic in origin.  Therefore, the
Neurology service was consulted.  It was thought that perhaps
the patient had a basilar artery transient ischemic attack.
A head CT was performed, and this was negative.  Therefore,
it was thought that the patient did not have a primary
neurologic event.  She ruled out for myocardial infarction.
There was no recurrence of the atrial fibrillation noted on
the monitor in the field.  Her aspirin, atenolol, Zestril and
Lipitor were continued.

Two days after admission, on the [**8-15**], while the
patient's cousin was visiting, the patient was noted to slump
over and become unresponsive for a second time.  Rhythm strip
showed junctional escape with a heart rate of 15.  She was
assumed to be in bradycardic arrest.  She was intubated for a
second time, and the electrophysiology division of the
Cardiology service was consulted.  She was thought to have a
sick sinus syndrome, and a DDD pacer was placed.  Lasix was
given for diuresis.  She received bronchoscopy, which removed
a large dried mucous plug at the tip of the endotracheal
tube.  Bronchial washings from that bronchoscopy revealed
only gram-negative rods on Gram [**Last Name (LF) 2733**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was started on
ceftriaxone and Flagyl.

The following day, on the [**8-17**], she was extubated.
However, she required very high levels of oxygen to maintain
her saturations above 90%.  To investigate this, a chest
x-ray was performed which revealed bilateral pleural
effusions, as well as cardiomegaly.  An echocardiogram was
performed that showed mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy, preserved left ventricular function with an
ejection fraction greater than 55%, normal right ventricular
systolic function, trace aortic regurgitation, mild mitral
regurgitation, and no pericardial effusion.  There was no
change compared to the echocardiogram performed in [**2130-8-14**].

In light of these findings, we postulated that the cause of
her poor oxygenation was multifactorial, including
restrictive lung disease from obesity and cardiomegaly, as
well as her pleural effusions.  She was continued on lasix
for diuresis and, on [**11-19**], was transferred to the
general medical floor for further management.

On [**11-20**], while in the Radiology Department following an
x-ray, she was found on the stretcher with an ashen
appearance, diaphoretic, and unresponsive.  A code was
called.  Her portable oxygen tank was noted to be empty.
When her mask was hooked up to wall oxygen, she gradually
gained consciousness and there were no residual deficits.

On [**11-22**], she underwent thoracentesis on the right, which
was the larger of her effusions.  300 cc of serosanguinous
exudative fluid were drained.  The cytology was negative.

The following day, she underwent diagnostic bronchoscopy,
which was essentially unremarkable.  Later that night, she
had increasing hypoxia, a temperature of 100.8, a white count
of 14, and a chest x-ray which showed increasing bilateral
effusions.  She had warm extremities.  Therefore, it was felt
that she was likely in septic shock with bacterial source
being from a primary pulmonary infection.  She was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, where central
access was obtained and she was started on dopamine for
pressure support.  She received noninvasive positive pressure
ventilation and nebulized treatments.  A CT scan of the chest
on [**11-24**] showed moderate bilateral effusions and
multifocal opacities, consistent with pneumonia.  Incidental
note was made of a left adrenal mass, most consistent with an
adenoma.  Since she developed this pneumonia while she was in
the hospital, we covered her broadly with vancomycin,
ceftazidime and Flagyl.  We continued with NIPPV for two more
days, but she did not significantly improve.  Therefore, on
[**11-27**], she was reintubated.  Fentanyl was used for
sedation, and dopamine was continued.

The following day, she received diagnostic bronchoscopy for a
specimen collection, but these grew only oropharyngeal flora.
Thus in the absence of a predominant pathogen, her antibiotic
therapy was eventually changed to levofloxacin and Flagyl on
[**11-30**].  On that same day, she was changed from assist
control mode to SIMV plus pressure support.  She tolerated
this well.  She had a very brief temperature spike to 101.4
on [**12-1**], but no increase in white count was noted, and
she had no subsequent temperature spikes.

In light of the patient's very slow recovery from her
pneumonia, multiple discussions were held with the patient as
well as with her family to discuss the patient's end of life
issues.  The patient made it very clear that she wished to
proceed with maximal medical management providing that she
still had a chance to recover from her pneumonia.  Therefore,
on [**12-5**], she received tracheotomy and percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy for anticipated discharge to inpatient
rehabilitation.

Additional aspects of her hospital stay were as follows:
Cardiovascular:  We discontinued the patient's beta blockade
and ACE inhibitor in light of her hypotension.  We continued
her Lipitor and aspirin.

Gastrointestinal:  She was placed on Prevacid for
gastrointestinal prophylaxis.

Nutrition:  She was fed by tube feeds via an orogastric tube,
which was later changed to a percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy.

Endocrine:  We maintained adequate blood glucose control via
NPH insulin and a regular insulin sliding scale.

Neurology:  We continued the patient on Neurontin and
Sinemet.

Hematology:  The patient has a baseline anemia, which
responded well to periodic transfusion.  Her baseline
hematocrit is approximately 30.0.

Prophylaxis:  The patient was on heparin for deep venous
thrombosis prophylaxis, and Prevacid for gastrointestinal
prophylaxis.

Code status:  With multiple discussions held with the patient
and her family, it was determined that she was Full Code.

DISPOSITION:   The patient will be discharged to inpatient
rehabilitation once accepted at a rehabilitation facility.

Discharge instructions and medication list will be provided
on the discharge addendum.

post AV pacer placement on [**2112-4-30**] and congestive heart
failure with an ejection fraction of 15% and chronic renal
insufficiency who awoke at 6 a.m. with 10/10 chest pain
radiating to her abdomen that gave her nausea and great
distress.  The patient presented to the Emergency Department
on [**5-23**] and was given sublingual nitrogen x3 with a
decrease in base to 5 from 10.  She received Lopressor,
aspirin and 2 liters oxygen by nasal cannula.  The patient's
pain was reproducible by palpation below the pacemaker

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Afebrile, 112/57, pulse 70, respirations 13 and
02 saturation of 97%
GENERAL:  Patient was in bed in some distress.
PULMONARY:  The patient was clear to auscultation
bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  She was distended, positive bowel sounds.  She was
soft without tenderness.
EXTREMITIES:  She had 1+ lower extremity edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  She was alert and oriented x3.  Cranial nerves
II through XII grossly intact.
NECK:  Positive jugular venous distention.

LABS UPON ADMISSION:  The patient had a white count of 10.6,
hematocrit of 31.9, platelets of 179.  Her MCV was 98.
Electrolytes:  She had a sodium of 136, potassium of 4.0,
chloride of 97, bicarbonate of 23, BUN of 115, creatinine of
2.2.  She had a digoxin level of 2.8, TSH of 6.0, free T4 of

Electrocardiogram was AV paced and she had T-wave changes in
V1 and V2.  Chest x-ray:  No evidence of congestive heart
failure or cardiomegaly and an echocardiogram from [**2111-1-23**]
showed an ejection fraction of 15%.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE BY DATES:  On [**5-24**], the patient ruled in
for a myocardial infarction by enzymes and she was sent to
the CCU for low blood pressure.  Swan placed and pressors
were started.  She was found to be in tamponade with
equalization of pressures.  On [**5-25**], pericardiocentesis was
attempted in the catheter lab, but patient coded.  It was [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] in the catheter lab and an emergent thoracotomy with
pericardial drainage was performed by CT surgery.  On [**5-25**],
after the emergent thoracotomy, the patient was transferred
to the SICU on pressors and on the vent.

On [**5-28**], the patient was progressing in the SICU, but
developed rapid atrial fibrillation, so she was transferred
to the CCU, started on amiodarone and the patient
spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm.  On [**5-30**], the
patient was extubated and creatinine gradually to trend up to
3.7 and that is high from 2.2 on admission.  On [**6-3**], the
patient was unable to get sufficient fluid off despite
Natrecor, Lasix and metolazone, so they tried to reduce
afterload with Hydril and Isordil.

On [**6-6**], her creatinine peaked at 4.2 and they had to back
off the Lasix due to renal failure.  Renal was consulted was
consulted at this time and the family wanted to proceed with
dialysis.  On [**6-8**], hemodialysis was started but the
patient's blood pressure could not tolerate such a procedure
and significant fluid was not removed.  On [**6-9**], renal had a
trial of CVVH to remove fluid and therefore CVVH was started.
On [**6-13**], CVVH was stopped after removing greater than 8
liters over the previous four days.  On [**6-14**], renal decided
to retry hemodialysis which was successful.  The patient
tolerated it well and one more liter of fluid was removed.

On [**6-15**], a right subclavian tunneled catheter was placed by
IR.  On [**6-16**], the patient was called out to the floor for
placement and all central lines were pulled except for the
hemodialysis tunneled catheter.  On [**6-17**], the patient had an
episode of blood loss from the site where a previous groin
line was pulled, but it resolved with pressure.  The patient
needed one unit of packed red blood cells.

On [**6-18**], the patient started to have significant bleeding from
the hemodialysis tunneled catheter site and the patient was
unable to go to the rehabilitation given this issue.  On [**6-19**],
pressure dressing was applied, but there was still lots of
oozing.  There was an episode of chest pain and the patient
was ruled out by enzymes.  On [**6-21**], IR reevaluated the site,
injected with thrombin and the site continued to ooze despite
this.

On [**6-22**], the patient had platelets of 99, INR of 1.7.  IR felt
this was why the catheter continued to bleed.  They stopped
Protonix and started to check labs for concern of a chronic
DIC picture.  The patient started to show a chronic DIC
picture on [**6-24**] with increased fibrin degradation products,
increased D-dimer, normal fibrinogen with normal PT/PTT and
decreased platelets in the setting of breathing around the
catheter site.  On [**6-24**], as well, the patient experienced
chest pain and was ruled in by enzymes with a troponin max of
9.4 and flat CKs.  The patient was started on oxygen and beta
blocker.

The patient could not tolerate aspirin at the time due to
oozing around the catheter site.  On [**6-25**], pressure was held
on the catheter site for 30 minutes and cryoglobulin,
platelets and a unit of red cells were transfused.  Bleeding
decreased.

Again later, another unit of cryoglobulin, packed red blood
cells and bag of platelets were transfused.  Bleeding around
the catheter site stopped on [**6-26**].  On [**6-27**], the patient
received hemodialysis and is ready for discharge to [**Hospital6 19682**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Patient stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Insulin 70/30 40 units in addition to a sliding scale
a.m.
2.  Amiodarone 200 once a day
3.  Miconazole as needed
4.  Colace 100 twice a day
5.  Metoprolol 12.5 twice a day
6.  Calcium carbonate 500 twice a day
7.  Epogen [**Numeric Identifier 961**] units 3x a week
8.  Nephrocaps 1 per day
9.  Aspirin 325 once per day since bleeding has resolved.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient to be discharged to [**Hospital **]
Hospital with multiple diagnoses.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Chronic DIC
2.  Pulseless electrical activity arrest following cardiac

IMPRESSION: Marked cardiomegaly. Similar appearance of pacemaker
device. No significant interval change.

FOOT AP,LAT & OBL RIGHT  [**2177-12-9**] 1:23 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Likely acute fracture at the base of the fifth metatarsal.
Would correlate with point tenderness in this region when the
patient is examined.
2. Angulation and evidence of prior fracture at the distal shaft
of the fifth metatarsal.

[**2177-12-10**] ECHO
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. No atrial  septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall  thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed with aneurysmal basal
to mid infero-lateral and inferior walls. The antero-septum and
anterior walls appear to contract well (the apex is not well
seen) No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of  [**2177-6-26**], the overall LVEF has probably
improved and the severity of TR detected has decreased.

History of Present Illness:
75 yo man with past medical history significant for CHF (EF
20%), s/p Vtach arrest and PNA 2 weeks ago who now presents
after being found unresponsive at rehab. Family called him as
late as 10:30 the morning of admission, and he was alert and
oriented at his baseline. When his wife arrived at 1:30pm, she
found him with ""agonal breathing"" responding only to painful
stimuli. He was placed on a face mask and slowly began to wake
up. The pt states he remembers riding in the ambulance and by
the time he arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] was A&Ox3.
.
Family states that he had been doing better at rehab and was off
O2. However, three days PTA his BUN/Cr were elevated and they
talked with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and agreed to give him a slow infusion
of fluid. Family states he felt better that day, but then the
following day was c/o increased trouble breathing and was placed
back on O2 NC (they estimate 5-10L but are unsure). The daughter
states that when she came to visit she would turn him down to 2L
and he seemed comfortable. Pt also notes he felt like his
abdomen was getting more distended (this is his normal symptom
when he has a CHF exacerbation) and asked his wife to remove the
top button from his pants. They note that since being at rehab
he has kept the head of his bed up when sleeping. They also
remark that in the past he has not always known when his AICD
has fired. He denies any CP, LH, dizziness, N/V today, but does
not remember what happened.

      CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
         FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
         Reference Range:  Negative.
         A positive result in a recently treated patient is of
uncertain
         significance unless the patient is currently
symptomatic
         (relapse).


Brief Hospital Course:
75yo man with PMH significant for afib/atach, s/p AICD/pacer,
cardiomyopathy, s/p cardiac arrest, s/p MVR, HTN,
hypothyroidism, who was admitted for an episode of
unresponsiveness at his rehab facility and respiratory distress.

.
Hospital course is reviewed below by problem:
.
#) respiratory distress - Pt was initially admitted to the ICU,
and then transferred to the floor once his respiratory status
stabilized.  SOB most likely multifactorial with components of
pneumonia and CHF exacerbation. Pt currently with decreasing O2
requirement (was up to 100%[**Date Range 597**]< now on 4L NC). Pt was diuresed
with Lasix 40 IV on a prn basis.
1) pneumonia -
- covered with azithro and ceftriaxone (now day #5) for
atypicals, gram positives, gram negatives.  Should continue for
14 day course.
- flu was negative
2) CHF - BNP >8000
- continued lasix 40mg IV prn
- baseline BP 90/60, and pt tolerated BP's in the 80's without
symptoms
.
#) unresponsiveness at rehab - most likely cardiac vs
respiratory. ABG on admission 7.52/33/68 on [**Last Name (LF) 597**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have been
worse w/o [**First Name3 (LF) 597**] at rehab, likely was hypoxic causing
unresponsiveness (as improved with oxygen). Pt w/ AICD/pacer,
but pacer spike occasionally occuring on QRS.
- EP consulted, interrogated pacer, reported that they would not
be able to pace the patient out of MAT
- pt was monitored on tele
- continued amiodarone at 400mg daily
- continued [**First Name3 (LF) **], coumadin, carvedilol for cardiac issues
.
#) CRI - Cr 1.6 on last discharge, 1.4 on admission, but stable
at 1.1 this am. Cr was monitored closely given aggressive
diuresis.
.
#) Decubitus ulcer - continued miconazole powder, wound care
.
#) anorexia - likely secondary to underlying illness, nutrition
consulted. Continued diet w/ soft foods and ensure. Pt does not
like boost.
.
#) constipation - aggressive bowel regimen - colace, senna,
dulcolax, lactulose prn.
.
#) low BP - pt's baseline 90/60. ACEI changed to captopril for
better titration.
.
#) FEN: Cardiac diet. Continued diet w/ soft foods and ensure.
Pt does not like boost.
.
#) PPX: continued coumadin, bowel regimen, ppi
.
#) Dispo: to rehab

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Cardiac arrest.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69 year old
male with a history of coronary artery disease status post
remote myocardial infarction, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease who presented status post witnessed arrest at home in
the presence of his wife.  The patient was reported to have
fallen backwards without prodrome or complaint, hitting the
floor near his bed.  EMS was contact[**Name (NI) **] and arrived upon the
scene within five minutes.  The patient was found to be
pulseless and apneic.

CPR was started, the patient was intubated and pads were
placed revealing ventricular fibrillation.  The patient was
defibrillated at 200, 300 and 300, with no response.  He was
given 1 mg of epinephrine which converted him to systole,
then given Atropine times two and Epinephrine times three,
which converted him to PEA, which transitioned to an
idioventricular rhythm at 20 beats per minute.  The patient
had pacing attempted without success.  He reverted to
asystole.

He was given an ampule of bicarbonate and epinephrine which
converted the patient to ventricular fibrillation.  He was
defibrillated at 03:16, given 300 mg of Amiodarone.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital3 417**] and then transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**].

His EKG showed inferoposterior injury changes.  He arrived on
Dobutamine, Neo-Synephrine and Amiodarone.  Cardiac
catheterization revealed diffuse three-vessel disease.  He
has elevated left filling pressures.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Coronary artery disease status post remote myocardial
infarction.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Hypertension.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atenolol.
2.  Lipitor.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] has a
positive smoking history.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's pulse was 83; blood
pressure 123/60; respiratory rate of 14 and oxygen saturation
of 98%, on mechanical ventilation of AC-800 by 14;
respiratory rate of 15.  He was on 100% FIO2.  On general
examination, the patient was an ill appearing intubated man
in no apparent distress.  HEENT examination reveals scleral
edema and moist mucous membranes.  Neck examination revealed
no lymphadenopathy.  Cardiac examination revealed a regular
rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 that were distant and no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary examination revealed
diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheezes.  Abdominal
examination revealed a belly that was soft, moderately
distended, nontender, with no bowel sounds appreciated.
Extremities revealed trace edema and no dorsalis pedis
pulses.

LABORATORY:  Pertinent laboratory findings were the patient's
white count of 8.0 with a hematocrit of 36.5 and platelets of
188.  The patient's creatinine was 1.5.  His CK was 138 with
an MB of 28.7, a troponin of 1.98.

Initial arterial blood gas was 7.19 with pCO2 of 37 and pAO2
of 301.

EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm, normal axis and massive ST
elevations in II, III and AVF with reciprocal changes in I
and L.  The patient also had early transition and massive ST
depressions in V2 through V5.  These findings were consistent
with an inferoposterior myocardial infarction.

Cardiac catheterization revealed diffusely diseased three
vessel coronary system.  The mid-left circumflex was totally
occluded as was the mid right coronary artery.  The left
anterior descending was diffusely diseased.  The patient had
two stents, one to the ostium and one to the mid-portion of
the right coronary artery.  Pulmonary capillary wedge was 40.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 69 year old man with a
history of coronary artery disease status post remote
myocardial infarction, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia as
well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, presented with
witnessed cardiac arrest and large inferoposterior myocardial
infarction.

1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient presented with ventricular
fibrillation arrest at home with prolonged resuscitation in
the setting of an inferoposterior myocardial infarction.  He
had total occlusions of the mid right coronary artery and mid
circumflex with a diffusely diseased left anterior
descending.  He received stents times two to his mid right
coronary artery.  He was transferred from the Catheterization
Laboratory on Dopamine and an intra-aortic balloon pump.  The
patient had no palpable pulses in his lower extremities, and
the move was made to remove the intra-aortic balloon pump.

The patient had a worsening lactic acidosis throughout the
morning of admission.  He remained in normal sinus rhythm on
Amiodarone and Lidocaine drips.  He required mechanical
ventilation for control of his acid-based status as well as
for airway protection.  Increasing respiratory rate and total
volumes were not able to control the patient's overwhelming
acidosis.

The patient was markedly oliguric and volume control was not
able to be obtained.  The patient had a markedly distended
abdomen and there was concern for ischemic bowel.  A KUB
showed wall thickening and no free air.  The intra-aortic
balloon pump was removed and the patient continued to have a
worsening acidosis.

After discussion with the family, the decision was made to
abandon aggressive efforts.

The patient experienced at 06:55 p.m. on [**2102-4-23**].

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Deceased.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Ventricular fibrillation arrest.
2.  Inferoposterior myocardial infarction.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Overwhelming lactic acidosis.
8.  Acute renal failure.

CCath

Brief Hospital Course:
89 yo female with extensive CAD s/p CABG and TO SVG and recent
95% LM lesion stented. Pt with recurrent angina like symptoms,
resulting in repeat diagnostic cath c/b FA bleed and aneurysm
requiring multiple blood transfusions and pressors.

1) CAD:  Pt with extensive CAD s/p CABG and recent LMCA stent
who presented for repeat diagnostic catherization that showed
patent stent but complicated by common femoral artery bleed.
Given Pt's HD instability post-procedure, Pt was only continued
on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] and Plavix; while holding BB.  After
stabilization Pt was restarted on a BB.  Pt will continue to be
managed medically. [**Hospital **] medical regimen consisting of
atenolol 12.5 mg qd (to be titrated up as outpatient as
tolerated), [**Hospital **] 325 qd, Plavix 75 mg qd times 9 months,
Simvastatin 10 mg qd.  On transfer Pt recieving Cozaar 50 mg qd,
which was held during hospital stay due to HD instability; it
should be added back on as an outpatient when seen next week by
PCP if Pt continues to be stable.

2) Vascular: As above, Pt's catherization complicated by CFA
aneurysm and bleed.  Initial external pressure unsuccesful in
stopping the bleed.  Attempt to asses artery from the other
femoral artery unsuccessful given extensive artherosclerosis.
However, with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 79818**] [**Last Name (un) **] from a the same FA was able to be
advanced to the aneursym with succesful tamponade.  CT confirmed
significant retroperitoneal bleed.  Pt did require 2 emergent
units of PRBC and the initiation of dopamine gtt given
hypotension.  Pt aggresively hydrated overnight, with serial
Hcts being stable.  Hct then began to trend down requiring an
additional 4 units of PRBC the following day.  Hemodynamically
Pt improved and was weaned off dopamine.  Vascular surgery
followed throughout and was integral in her management.  Hct
stabilized once again; not requiring further transfusions or
exploratory surgery.

3) Pump:  A p-MIBI earlier in the year with evidence of EF 72%.
Pt without history of CHF or LV dysfunction.  Pt hypovelemic
secondary to RP bleed and was aggresively hydrated during
initial hospital days. [**Last Name (un) **] held due to this instability and BB
started at a lower dose.  Out Pt cardiac regimen as above and
weill be titrated to maximum effect as outpatient given Pt's
ability to tolerate.

4) CRI: Pt with known CRI with a reported baseline Cr 1.8 prior
to admission. Initial Cr 2.1 however remaining Cr ranged from
1.2 - 1.1.  Pt managed with mucomyst prior to and proceeding
catherization as well as receiving D5 with NaBicarb.  No
evidence of renal failure or insufficiency during hospital stay.
 Pt to be followed up as outpatient.

History of Present Illness:
89F s/p remote CABG underwent left main stent [**2196-11-21**] at [**Hospital1 18**],
then had a relook for atypical pain [**2196-12-8**] with patent stent
but c/b left femoral artery bleed, s/p balloon tamponade and
stablizied. Pt was D/C'd to [**Hospital1 **] rehab. Pt has a hx
of spinal stenosis and has been complaining of worsening back
pain since he could not get his pain shot due to [**Hospital1 **]. Per
Rehab, pt c/o worseing back pain and also DOE. EKG with
?ischemic changes; tx with nitro, morphine. Pt c/o abdominal
pain/ back pain since the cath. Pain and SOB got worse and
initially planned to tx to [**Hospital1 **] but re-reouted b/c pt unstable. On
arrival to [**Name (NI) **], pt noted to be febrile T102, hypotension
70/40, new a-fib, CHF (+CXR, BNP 1220). Pt transiently on Neo
for hypotension, received PRBC + IVF. WBC noted for 21.3 and Hct
26.4 (31.6 on [**12-17**]). Pt was started on Digoxin and Amiodarone
for a-fib, received IV Lasix. BCx + UCx grew MRSA and was
started on Vanc, Timentin, and Levofloxacin. She was ruled out
by enzymes. Since she had severe back pain, worrisome for
worsening RP bleed given Hct and was transferred.

adrenal gland atenuation, large umbilical hernia, multiple
diverticuli.

CXR [**1-4**]: c/w CHF

EKG: A-fib in 74 BPM, RBBB, nl axis, nl ST changes.

RUQ U/S: Status-post cholecystectomy. Prominent common bile duct
without evidence of stones or sludge within the bile duct.

CXR: Probable CHF with small pleural effusions. Small focal
ill-defined opacities in right upper lobe, right lung base, and
left lower lobe are consistent with multifocal areas of
pneumonia. No prior films for comparison. Correlate clinically
and with follow-up after therapy.

CTA ABDOMEN/PELVIS ([**2197-1-8**]):
1) Bilateral pleural effusions slightly increased from previous
exam.
2) Diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta and
its major branches as described. However, normal appearing bowel
with patency of the mesenteric vasculature; no evidence for
bowel ischemia.
3) Uncomplicated anterior abdominal wall hernia
4) Interval mild decrease in size of left retroperitoneal
hematoma.
5) Persistent common bile duct dilatation and intrahepatic
ductal dilatation with no evidence for choledocholithiasis or
obstructing mass.

Echo ([**2197-1-9**]): EF>55%, [**2-5**]+ MR; essentially unchanged from
[**2196-12-9**]

ERCP ([**2197-1-14**]): Five fluoroscopic spot film images were
obtained from ERCP. The images show cannulation of the common
bile duct with opacification with contrast. The common bile duct
is massively dilated. The films then show passing of a wire into
the intrahepatic ducts which are also opacified. Opacification
of the intrahepatic ducts show dilatation also. No filling
defects are identified.  Pt got stented in the common bile duct

CT ABD/PEVIS/THIGH: ([**2197-1-17**])
1) Interval development of a right thigh swelling consistent

second portion of the duodenum.
3) Interval decrease in size of left retroperitoneal hematoma.
4) Interval decrease in bilateral pleurarl effusions, with
compressive atelectasis.
5) Diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the abdomen aorta and its
major branches as described.
6) Uncomplicated anterior abdominal wall hernia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU since she has a history of
RP bleed several weeks prior to admission and there was a Hct
drop at the outside hospital.  The Abdominal CT done at OSH on
[**1-4**] and [**1-6**] showed stable retroperitoneal hematoma.  Pt came
in with fever, leukocytosis, Blood Cx and Urine Cx positive for
MRSA, and was started on Vancomycin, Timentin, and levofloxacin
at the OSH.  CXR on admission showed multilobar pneumonia/CHF,
and the patient was breathing on non-rebreather and appeared
very somnolent.  Pt had diffuse abdominal pain on admission with
elevated alk phos and leukocytosis.  Abd CT from the OSH showed
dilated common bile duct and intrahepatic bile duct.
Antibiotics were changed to Vanc and levofloxacin (d/c'd
timentin), and Flagyl was later added for the history of
diarrhea prior to presentation suspicious for C.diff.  Pt
remained somnolent, breathing heavily on [**Last Name (LF) 597**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] IV Lasix were
given with minimal effect.  Due to the diffuse abdominal pain,
surgery and GI were consulted.  There was a concern for
cholangitis, and MRCP was recommended but she was unstable at
that time to go down for the study.  There was also concern for
mesenteric ischemia, so pt underwent to CTA of the
abdomen/pelvis which showed patent major mesenteric vasculature,
persistent dilated common bile duct, and stable/slightly
decreased retroperitoneal hematoma.  In a setting of getting the
IV contrast and lasix for diuresis for CHF, pt developed acute
renal failure secondary to contrast.  Pt was oliguric for
several days requiring HD x3, but eventually UOP improved and
her creatinine came down to her baseline (Cr 1.0).  During the
placement of HD quintin cath, she had a complication of R thigh
hematoma but her Hct was stable after transfusion.  Due to
persistent abdominal pain, pt underwent ERCP which showed no
evidence of cholangitis; however a stent was placed in the
common bile duct.  Prior to ERCP, pt was electively intubated
for ERCP but was noted to have laryngeal edema since it was
difficult to pass the endoscope.  Although there was no evidence
of cholangitis, after the stent placement, her alk phos came
down as well as improvement in her abdominal exam showing less
tenderness/guarding and eventually became completely benign.
The stent in the common bile duct should be removed in 3 months.
 ID team has been following her and the abx was changed from
Vanc/Levo ->Vanc/levo/flagyl but no improvement in white count
with C.diff negative, so levofloxacin and flagyl were
discontinued and meropenem was added since the culture from her
sacral decub ulcer grew multi-resistant Klebsiella only
sensitive to meropenem/Zosyn/sulfa.  All of her blood cultures
showed no growth, and the sputum culture grew MRSA.  She had
episodes of hypotension requiring Dopamine for few days until
meropenem was initiated.  After meropenem was started in
addition to Vancomycin, pt showed clinical improvement with
decrease in white count, improvement in her respiratory status,
improvement in BP and was able to come off the pressors.  Pt got
WBC scan to look for other source of infection but only showed
positive area in the lungs consistent with pneumonia.  No
abdominal source of infection was detected.  Since she has a
documented Blood culture with MRSA, she will need to complete a
6 week course of vancomycin.  She will complete a 2 week course
of meropenem.  Her stage II decubitous ulcer on sacrum is cared
by duoderm q 3days.  Pt remained intubated after the elective
intubation for ERCP because she had a laryngeal edema and also
to keep her stable for the WBC scan.  Pt received IV Solu-Medrol
for 3 days and was successfully extubated on [**1-20**].  When
extubated, pt was found to have difficulty hearing which
improved gradually over time.  If she were to have persistent
hearing impairment, she should be seen by ENT as outpatient.  In
terms of cardiac issues, pt presented with new a-fib but
immediately converted to sinus rhythm on admission after
receiving amiodarone and metoprolol.  There were episodes of
sinus bradycardia to the 30's-40's, so both medications were
held at times.  However, once pt was extubated and stable, she
was able to be re-started on metorpolol and Losartan.
Amiodarone was not continued since she was briefly in atrial fib
which was converted immediately and remained in sinus rhythm
since.  Since she had a recent left main coronary stent, she
will need to be on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], as well as metoprolol, statin,
and [**Last Name (un) **].  She was noted to have copious thick secretion
requiring frequent suctioning, use of flutter valve, mucinex,
and chest PT.  There were few episodes where she desaturated to
the low 80's which improved after suctioning.  Pt should be
continued on frequent suction, chest PT, and mucinex once
discharge.  She complained of R thigh pain prior to discharge
which was though to be musculoskeletal in origin since LENI was
negative for DVT.  It did show left perneal superficial thrombus
but no anticoagulation needed to be started.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 63 year old male transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] from an
OSH for STEMI, in cardiogenic shock on pressors.

Pt initially presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2112-9-11**] with SOB
and chest pain of approximately 1 wk duration. In OSH ED, was
found to have RML PNA. He also reported fall one week prior with
facial ecchymosis, found to have nasal fx by CT. EKG showed
sinus tach in the 130s with Qs in II,III,aVF with nl. axis and
intervals and T-waves inverted in inferior leads and ST
depressions in the lateral leads. Pt received ASA, b-blockers,
morphine, nitro paste, levaquin and was pain-free with sats in
the 90%s on 100%NRB. Troponin was 0.525 with flat CK. T max
99.1. WBC 15.9, Hct 44.5%. Received lovenox sq, with last dose
at 12am [**2112-9-12**].
On [**9-12**] at noon, pt became SOB and diaphoretic with pain, and
sats fell to 77% on 100%NRB with HR120. Received 40mg of lasix,
4mg morphine, and was intubated at 12:30pm. At 1pm, EKG showed
sinus at 100, nl intervals and axis with Qs in III & aVF, ST
elevations in III>II, and ST depressions in I,aVL. Blood
pressure fell s/p intubation to 60s/20s requiring fluid
resuscitation and dopamine 10mcg/kg/min. O2 sats rose to 88% on
AC700mlx14/min + 5PEEP. CXR showed worsening of a R lung
alveolar process with extrusion to the L side, with a
differential of infection vs R>L pulmonary edema.  Patient was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

CATH [**2112-9-12**]: LMCA had a 40% lesion. LAD had diffuse luminal
irregularities but was free of significant stenoses and supplied
2 moderate-sized diagonal branches which were also free of
significant disease. LCX had a hazy 60% lesion in the mid
vessel and a hazy 80% lesion in the distal vessel. The RCA was a
small
vessel and was totally occluded in the mid segment. A R-PDA was
seen
filling via L-R collaterals. Resting hemodynamics revealed
evidence of cardiogenic shock with an aortic pressure of 94/53
mmHg, a cardiac index of 1.3 L/min/m2 and a
PCWP of 30 mmHg on an infusion of dopamine at 10 mcg/kg/min.

with a 3.5 x 13 mm cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 55492**] and 3.0 x 13 mm cypher
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 22595**] at 14 atms with no residual stenosis, no dissection and
timi 3
flow.

Transthoracic Echo [**2112-9-13**]:
EF 70% The overall left ventricular ejection fraction is normal
(borderline
hyperdynamic) but the lateral wall and adjacent segments of
anterior free wall
are hypokinetic relative to the frankly hyperdynamic inferior
and posterior
walls. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2112-9-12**], the cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation with ventricular
tachycardia;
the lateral wall (which now appears relatively hypokinetic) was
not
well-visualized on the prior study; therefore no direct
comparison of
contractile function in this territory can be made.

Transesophageal Echo [**2112-9-13**]:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal.
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter
and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic
regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral
leaflets are
myxomatous. There is moderate/severe posterior mitral leaflet
prolapse. There
is partial mitral leaflet flail. There is moderate thickening of
the mitral
valve chordae. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the CCU service after his
catheterization. Overall the following weeks the pt was
determined to be extremely sick with multiple organ system
failure. He needed a mitral valve replacement surgery, however,
in order to have this surgery he would need to be extubated and
afebrile. He was treated with hemodialysis and further diuresis
was attempted with IV diuretics and BNP, however the pt's
respiratory status remained tenuous. Furthermore, he did not
wake up when sedation was weaned. He was evaluated by Neuro with
an EEG that showed only diffuse slowing and a head CT that
showed no acute changes. It was felt likely that due to his
episodes of hypotension with the VT and other hemodynamic
instability later that he had sustained anoxic brain injury.
This was all discussed with the family who felt that the pt
would not have wanted to be kept alive on a ventilator long-term
when any hope of recovery was extremely slim. As all attempts to
wean him from the ventilator were unsuccessful he was made CMO
and made comfortable with morphine. He died shortly after.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7929**] was originally sent to the CCU, where he was
monitored on tele overnight in anticipation of having a cath/EP
study once he was more stable.  He had no further episodes of
VFib.  On the floor, he did have a few runs of NSVT (5-7 beats)
that were asymptomatic.  He was extubated on the morning of
[**8-1**], and originally had some cognitive deficits involving his
short term memory.  At first, he wasn't responding to questions
at all, but this had resolved by the time he came to the floor.
Originally he would forget things seconds after being told, but
this had completely resolved by the day of discharge.  He had
been previously placed on coumadin as an outpt for a depressed
EF, and this was held while a heparin drip was begun.  He was
maintained on a heparin drip until his cath.  At his cath, they
found:
1. Coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant
circulation with
severe two vessel coronary artery disease.  LMCA had no
significant
disease.  LAD had 80% stenosis before and involving the origin
of D2 and
after S1 (with collaterals to RCA).  LAD was totally occluded
after the
large D2.  D2 supplies apex and collaterals to RCA.  Lcx had a
large OM
branch and was free of significant disease. RCA was totally
occluded at
promixial to mid segment.
2. Limited resting hemodyanics revealed moderately elevated left
and
righ sided filling pressures.  mRA was 14 mmHg, and RVEDP was 16
mmHg.
RVSP was mildly elevated at 43 mmHg.  mPCW was elevated at 23
mmHg.
Fick calculated cardiac output and index were perserved at 6.1
L/min and
2.8 L/min/m2, respectively.
3.Successful Rotational Atherectomy and stenting of the mid LAD
lesion with a 2.75x23mm Cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] with a 3.0x15mm
NC Ranger
baloon inflated at 20 atms.
An Echo done on [**8-1**] showed:
Severely dilated left ventricle with extensive systolic
dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
Mild-moderate aortic
regurgitation. Mild aortic stenosis. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Compared with the report of 12/93 (tape unavailable for review),
the left
ventricular cavity is now more dilated, overall systolic
function is more
depressed, aortic regurgitation has increased.
He also had an EP study performed while he was here, and they
recommended ICD placement which was done on [**8-3**].  This was
complicated by a minor hematoma in the pocket of the pacer, that
did not grow in size and remained nontender.  He was given
vancomycin x3 doses and was sent home on Keflex for a total of 5
days.  The evening of the pacer placement, the pt was noted to
be tachycardic to the 120s.  An EKG showed sinus tach.  It was
felt this was likely [**2-6**] beta-blocker withdrawal, as it had been
approx 4-5 days since he had last had his BB (originally had
lower bp in CCU, systolic 100s so the BB had been held).  This
was restarted with good pulse control, although on ambulation he
still got up into the 100s and so his Toprol dose was increased
on d/c.  In terms of his other medications, his digoxin and
quinidine were discontinued.  It was felt he did not need to be
on anticoagulation with coumadin, given the questionable hx of
LV clot that was not seen on repeat echo, and given that he
would be at least on ASA and plavix.  His Lasix and Lisinopril
were not increased all the way back to his previous home doses,
as it was felt he would have a better EF given his [**Hospital1 **]-v pacing
and may not need as high a dose.  He had a UTI which was treated
with a 7 day course of Bactrim.  He did have a low-grade temp
(100.6) on [**8-3**] and [**8-4**], but had 2 CXR's negative for
infiltrate and no localizing signs of infection other than his
UTI.  His pacer site specifically did not look infected.  He was
discharged home with instructions to f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
[**4-11**] weeks and his PCP/Cardiologist Dr. [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7931**] within [**1-6**]

Echo ([**2169-8-31**]): estimated LVEF 35-40%
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed. Anterior, distal
septal, and apical
hypokinesis is present. No LV thrombus seen.
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
.
CXR ([**2169-8-31**]):
Heart size is within normal limits for supine technique. There
is tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. There is pulmonary vascular
engorgement with bilateral predominantly perihilar opacities
consistent with pulmonary edema. Well presumed Swan-Ganz
catheter introduced via femoral route overlies the tip located
in the region of the pulmonic valve but difficult to clearly
localize on this film. The intra-aortic balloon is approximately
4 cm inferior to the superior margin of the aortic arch. No
pneumothorax.  IMPRESSION: Pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
Swan-Ganz catheter in region of pulmonary valve. Could revaluate
with repeat film as tip not well localized.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 56 y/o female with h/o HTN who presented s/p VFib arrest
with large anterior MI s/p cath with POBA.
.
#Cardiac
.
a)Ischemia: Pt had a large anterior MI. An IABP was placed in
the cath lab due to the size of the infarct as a prophylactic
measure, but overall she did well and it was weaned off and the
balloon was d/c'd after the 18 hours of integrillin had
completed its course. She was started on metoprolol and this was
titrated up. Lisinopril was restarted as well as plavix, statin,
ASA.
.
b)Rhythm: s/p VFib and PEA arrest. Pt was monitored on telemetry
and had no further events. EP was consulted and obtained a
signal average ECG on [**9-4**] to determine if a defibrillator might
be appropriate in the future.
.
c)Pump: Echo post-event showed an LVEF of 35-50%. She was
restarted on lisinopril. She has been scheduled for a repeat
echo in 1 month to determine if an ICD might be indicated given
the VFib arrest.
.
# Infiltrates on CXR with ? of hemoptysis at OSH:  She was begun
on empiric treatment for PNA at the OSH with ceftriaxone and
flagyl. She improved and was changed to levofloxacin PO to
complete a 7 day course. (last day [**9-5**])
.
# Mental Status: pt was down for many minutes before
resuscitation occurred. In the hospital she was noted to have
problems with short term memory. She was seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
with neurology who specializes in memory loss that occurs in the
setting of VFib arrests and he felt that the pt would likely
recover most function given some time.

Service:  Medicine

IDENTIFICATION/CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is an 80 year
old female who was admitted for a lower gastrointestinal
bleed from [**Hospital1 5042**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Coronary artery disease; patient
has had coronary artery bypass grafting times two with
saphenous vein grafts to the posterior descending artery and
left anterior descending artery as well as aortic valve
replacement for critical aortic stenosis and tricuspid valve
repair in [**2126-5-14**] at [**Hospital6 1129**];
postoperative course complicated by a stroke, renal failure,
tracheotomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube
insertion and tracheal stenosis.  2.  Hypertension.  3.
Chronic renal failure.  4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.  5.  Hyperthyroidism.  6.  Clostridium difficile.
7.  Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus/Klebsiella
pneumoniae.  8.  Tracheal stenosis.

ALLERGIES:  Codeine.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Atenolol, Epogen, Flagyl, Pepcid,
albuterol, Combivent, l-thyroxin, metoclopramide, NPH
insulin, sliding scale insulin, vitamin C, Nepro, Flovent,
trazodone, iron sulfate, renal multivitamins, heparin
subcutaneously.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was transferred to
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for lower
gastrointestinal bleeding at [**Hospital1 5042**].  The patient was noted
to pass large blood clots from her rectum and was
subsequently hypotensive at [**Hospital1 5042**].  The patient was
transferred here for stabilization.  She underwent a
colonoscopy which demonstrated a proctosigmoiditis.  The
patient was treated with Rowasa and hydrocortisone enemas as
recommended by the gastroenterology service.  During her
stay, the patient also was followed by the nephrology service
for dialysis treatments.  The patient was maintained on her
medications as she had been on at [**Hospital1 5042**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient, when transferred out of
the Intensive Care Unit to the medical service, was in no
acute distress.  She had stable vital signs and she was
afebrile.  On neurological examination, the patient was
responsive to voice and seemed to communicate with facial
expressions.  She obeyed commands in all of her extremity
except for her right arm, which was related to her previous
stroke.  On cardiovascular examination, the patient had
normal heart sounds and no murmurs appreciated.  The
respiratory examination demonstrated coarse breath sounds
bilaterally.  On abdominal examination, the patient had a
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube and a slightly
distended abdomen, bowel sounds were present, she was soft
and nontender.  On musculoskeletal examination, the patient
did not have any edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course proceeded as
stated in the history of present illness.  She also underwent
a procedure on [**2126-8-30**] in the Operating Room for a
T-tube change and rigid bronchoscopy.  She was transferred to
the Post Anesthesia Care Unit and subsequently to the floor
in stable condition.  In initial attempt at capping the
T-tube was made and the patient was not able to tolerate it
immediately postoperatively.

The gastroenterology division recommended that the patient
was likely to have some ongoing bleeding from her
proctosigmoiditis and, thus, will need continued monitoring
of her hematocrit.  She was also recommended to continue with
both her Rowasa and hydrocortisone enemas.  The
hydrocortisone enemas were to be discontinued on [**2126-9-5**].  Her Rowasa enemas were to continue once a day for a
month and then change to an as needed basis.  It was also
recommended that the patient should follow up with an
affiliated gastroenterology with [**Hospital1 5042**].

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital1 5042**] in
satisfactory condition on [**2126-8-31**].

1.  Pulmonary:  The patient was started on pressure support
ventilation upon admission to the Intensive Care Unit.  She
was slowly weaned over her week in the ICU.  By the time of
discharge she was tolerating a trach mask with only
occasional episodes of tachypnea benefiting from periods of
rest on pressure support.  Further bronchoscopic evaluation
of her subglottic stenosis was deferred until patient was
stable and could follow-up as an outpatient.  Tight stress
dose steroids were started for her subglottic stenosis and
weaned over the week in the ICU.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient had negative CKs upon
cycling of enzymes after arriving in the unit.  Pacer was
capturing by the time the patient arrived.  Lidocaine drip
was discontinued after a period of stability in the unit.
The patient was started back on Lopressor with titration up
to 50 po bid to control blood pressures which were ranging in
the 150's to 170's.

3.  GI:  The patient had no further evidence of GI bleeding
after admission to the unit.  Hydrocortisone enemas were
discontinued during her stay.  Rowasa enemas were continued
with the plan for stopping them approximately one month after
discharge.  With plan to follow-up with the [**Hospital **] clinic.
Hematocrit remained stable through her stay and her Epogen
was continued.

Urinalysis positive nitrites, small leukocyte esterase, zero
to two white blood cells, many bacteria, zero red blood
cells.  No yeast or epithelial cells.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient with severe ischemic
cardiomyopathy and left ventricular ejection fraction of less
than 15% per [**2146-8-17**] echocardiogram.  It was felt that
the patient's rapid improvement with diuresis and blood
pressure control makes flash pulmonary edema the most likely
diagnosis upon admission.  There was a question of possible
infiltrate causing hypoxia and dyspnea, however, with
intravenous diuresis a repeat chest x-ray did not reveal any
focal infiltrate.  The patient remained stable on her
outpatient cardiac regimen.

The patient was ruled out for myocardial ischemia as possible
etiology of flash pulmonary edema and diffuse primarily old
EKG changes.  She ruled out with CK of 192, 197, 47, with CK
MB 7, 9 and troponin of 0.9 and 0.3.

Of note, on [**2147-6-10**], her troponin I increased to 5.5
but subsequently decreased the following day.  As the patient
had no symptoms of chest pain or EKG changes, the decision
was made to continue medical management and have the patient
follow-up with primary care physician as an outpatient.  The
patient remained chest pain free throughout this
hospitalization and continued to remain stable on outpatient
medical regimen.  As the patient had refused cardiac
catheterization in the past, this was again discussed and the
patient again refused elective catheterization.  The decision
to manage medically was agreed upon with primary care
physician.

2.  Pulmonary:  After initial episode of hypoxia, the patient
remained stable status post intravenous diuresis and
afterload reduction.  At time of discharge, her oxygen
saturations remained stable between 94 and 98% on room air.
A repeat PA and lateral chest x-ray was done to rule out
infiltrate status post diuresis which revealed no
infiltrates.

The patient had no cough, fever or sputum production.  She
did receive a single dose of Levofloxacin and Flagyl in the
Emergency Department prior to diuresis for possible pneumonia
as etiology of shortness of breath.  The antibiotics were not
continued as the patient had no leukocytosis or fever.  Her
fever curve and white blood cell count were monitored
throughout this hospitalization and remained negative.  A
repeat urine culture was drawn given a positive nitrites with
increased bacteria in her urinalysis.  Urine culture,
however, remained negative at time of discharge.

She is to follow-up with her primary care physician should
she develop symptoms of dysuria or fever.  \

3.  Endocrine:  The patient is a type 2 diabetic who, in the
past, has controlled her diabetes mellitus with diet alone.
Fingerstick blood sugars were performed four times a day and
glucose remained in good control.  The patient refused
regular insulin sliding scale but however, never had a
fingerstick blood sugar greater than 200.  She was continued
on Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and Fosamax for
osteoporosis.

4.  Renal:  The patient's BUN and creatinine remained stable
with diuresis, hovering around a baseline of 0.9 to 1.3.  The
patient had excellent urine output and a Foley catheter was
discontinued prior to discharge.  The patient was able to
urinate spontaneously.

5.  Gout:  The patient was continued on Allopurinol.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged to home with
home Physical Therapy and [**Hospital6 407**].

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:

Please note this is an interim discharge dictation summary.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89-year-old
with severe congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction of less than 15%, diabetes, and four admissions over
the last five months for acute congestive heart failure
exacerbations.  She presents with acute onset shortness of
breath and chest pain which began at 1 A.M. this morning.
She reports feeling short of breath starting right around
1:00, and was unable to return to sleep.  Shortness of breath
got worse until around 3:30, when she reports having intense
chest pain across the precordium, with no relief by
sublingual nitroglycerin x 2.  At that time, she was
diaphoretic and nauseous as well.  She reports no
palpitations, no dizziness or lightheadedness at the time.

EMS was called and arrived at the scene.  Her initial vital
signs were a blood pressure of 156/80, heart rate 120,
respiratory rate 24, with oxygen saturation of 100% on
non-rebreather.  Her oxygen saturations dropped to 88%.  She
was bagged with a rebound of oxygen saturation back to 99 to
100%.  She received lasix 80 mg intravenously x 1, sublingual
nitroglycerin x 4, and morphine 6 mg.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Department, the patient initially had an oxygen
saturation of 93% while being bagged with 100% FIO2.  She was
given lasix intravenously x 2, aspirin, additional 2 mg of
morphine, and intravenous nitroglycerin was initiated.  She
was started on CPAP 10 and 5 with improvement of her
shortness of breath.  At that time, her chest pain also
resolved.  An arterial blood gas was done, which showed
7.30/51/440.

She was then admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] Intensive Care Unit
for respiratory and cardiovascular monitoring.

Her past cardiac history includes a transthoracic
echocardiogram in [**2146-8-17**], which showed an ejection
fraction of less than 15%, severely depressed left
ventricular function, severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis, normal right ventricular wall motion, and 2+
mitral regurgitation.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts was performed in [**2147-5-17**] for symptomatic bradycardia, showed normal sterile
fashion between 63 and 79 throughout the two and a half week
duration.

answer questions appropriately.  She is mildly diaphoretic.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Her pupils were equal,
round and reactive to light.  She is anicteric.  Jugular
venous distention was seen to the jaw.  Her neck was supple.
Cardiovascular examination showed a regular rate, normal S1,
S2.  She had a II/VI holosystolic murmur at the left lower
sternal border.  Her chest had coarse crackles bilaterally
three-quarters of the way up.  There was no wheezing present.
On abdominal examination, her belly was soft, nontender,
nondistended.  There were normal active bowel sounds. Her
extremities had 1+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses
bilaterally, with trace pitting edema from the foot to the
ankle.  On neurologic examination, cranial nerves II through

HOSPITAL COURSE TO DATE:
1.  Congestive heart failure:  The patient was admitted
[**2147-7-22**] to [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] Intensive Care Unit for congestive
heart failure exacerbation.  Her presentation was very
similar to her last four admissions over the last five
months.  She was diuresed aggressively.  She was ready for
discharge on hospital day number two when it was noted that
she was in first degree AV conduction delay.  She was
transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] Coronary Care Unit on [**2147-7-24**]
secondary to arrhythmias (see below).

Upon admission to the Coronary Care Unit, she immediately
became short of breath, complained of chest pain, was
tachycardic to 120s, later followed by bradycardia down to
the 30s.  She became progressively tachypneic, with
desaturations, and she was electively intubated.  At the
time, it was thought that she was having acute (flash)
pulmonary edema.  She was extubated after two days, on
[**2147-7-26**], however, was reintubated the following day on
[**2147-7-27**] secondary to shortness of breath, chest pain and
tachypnea.

She was taken for cardiac catheterization on [**2147-7-28**] (see
below), and a Swan was placed for hemodynamic monitoring.  It
was noted that her PA diastolic pressures were elevated to
the 40s.  She was continued on aggressive diuresis.
Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**7-26**] showed an ejection
fraction of 20% with a follow-up echocardiogram on [**8-8**] after
revascularization which was unchanged.

Between [**7-28**] and [**8-1**], numerous attempts were made to
wean the patient to pressure support ventilation and each
time failed due to desaturations and tachypnea.  She was
extubated for the second time on [**2147-8-2**], but reintubated
within 45 minutes secondary to tachycardia to 150s,
ventricular fibrillation, desaturations to 80% while on face
[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] agitation.  Although at that time she had been
aggressively diuresed with appropriate response in her PA
diastolic pressures, it was thought that she still was volume
overloaded, and reintubations were secondary to flash
pulmonary edema.  Therefore, she was further diuresed and
extubated for a third time on [**2147-8-5**].  At the time of
extubation, she was immediately bridged to noninvasive
pressure support ventilation (BiPAP), and continued further
diuresis.

On [**2147-8-6**], while on BiPAP, she had another episode of
tachycardia, hypotension and respiratory distress.  She was
stabilized on fentanyl and Versed, with an esmolol drip, when
it was found that her tachycardia was secondary to atrial
fibrillation.  Although she avoided reintubation that night,
her atrial fibrillation continued for eight hours, and she
spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm the following
morning.

After the atrial fibrillation event, she was stabilized and
taken off BiPAP and placed on nasal cannula, which she
tolerated without event for greater than 24 hours.  On
[**2147-8-7**], after being extubated for approximately three days,
she was transferred to the floor.  Later that evening, she
again desaturated to the 80s, had another episode of flash
pulmonary edema, and was reintubated.  She was then taken
back to the Coronary Care Unit.

At the time of that episode, the patient was net negative
greater than 5 liters since the Swan-Ganz catheter was
pulled, showing a PA diastolic of around 15 to 20.  Although
it appeared that she had been aggressively diuresed, further
diuresis was continued, and she was extubated again [**2147-8-10**].
She was continued on BiPAP during the following days, with
intermittent use of nasal cannula and face [**Month/Day/Year **].  She
tolerated being off BiPAP well until the evening of [**2147-8-12**],
in which she had an episode of chest pain followed by
shortness of breath, again desaturated, was placed back on
BiPAP, and avoided reintubation.

At the time of this dictation, the patient was still
maintained on BiPAP overnight, with face [**Date Range **] and nasal
cannula during the daytime.

2.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient was admitted for a
fifth congestive heart failure exacerbation in less than six
months, which was presumed to be ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Exact diagnosis could not be known, as the patient refused
cardiac catheterization for many years.  Cardiac enzymes were
cycled on admission, and a troponin peaked at 32.4 on [**7-25**],
which occurred after transfer to the Coronary Care Unit and
after her first intubation.  Her CKs only were mildly
elevated, with a peak of 133 and a CK/MB of 9 and an index of
5.2.

The patient initially refused cardiac catheterization on this
admission as well but, after her second intubation, it was
thought that ischemic etiology had to be ruled out, and she
agreed to catheterization on [**2147-7-28**].  Cardiac
catheterization showed a normal left main and right coronary
artery without significant disease, however, the left
anterior descending and left circumflex both had 90% lesions,
which were stented with 0% residual.  An intra-aortic balloon
pump was placed after catheterization, and initially was very
difficult to wean due to dramatic fall in blood pressure.
However, on [**2147-8-2**], the balloon pump was able to be weaned
and pulled without event.

Following catheterization, aspirin and Plavix were initiated,
however, Integrilin was not started secondary to the
patient's age.  ACE inhibitors were initially started, and
Captopril was titrated up to 25, but the patient's blood
pressure did not tolerate.  This was discontinued, and
Lisinopril was started the following week, which was
eventually titrated up to 5 mg once daily and Lopressor at
12.5 twice a day at the time of dictation.

3.  Arrhythmias:  While in the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] Intensive Care
Unit, the patient was noted to have first degree AV
conduction delay.  Upon transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**], she was
found to be in third degree AV block/high-grade
intraventricular conduction delay.  She was immediately
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit and intubated as above.
Initially the third degree block/intraventricular conduction
delay was thought to be secondary to supratherapeutic Digoxin
levels (2.5), and a transvenous pacer was placed [**2147-7-24**],
however, the patient did not require pacing until
post-catheterization, when she had an episode of bradycardia
to the 50s, and ventricular pacing was initiated.

Although her conduction delay was initially thought to be
secondary to medications, her difficulty in extubation was
attributed to loss of atrial kick.  Therefore, a decision was
made to place a dual chamber pacemaker on [**2147-7-31**].  The
patient did well with the pacemaker, and was almost 100%
captured, with few exceptions.  One notable exception
occurred on [**2147-8-6**], when an episode of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation occurred, but spontaneously converted eight
hours later.  The patient was maintained on amiodarone
initially at 400 mg twice a day, which was weaned down to 400
once daily, with no other significant arrhythmias at the time
of dictation.

4.  Pulmonary:  Although the difficulty with extubation was
thought to be mainly secondary to congestive heart failure
and very low ejection fraction, Pulmonary was consulted for
recommendations.  The Pulmonary team also believed that the
patient's difficulty with extubation was secondary to
congestive heart failure, but was concerned about a left
lower lobe collapse as seen on chest x-ray.  A bronchoscopy
was performed, which showed no collapsible airways, and some
frothy secretions.  A bronchoalveolar lavage was performed,
which was found to be negative.  Her left lower lobe
atelectasis was treated with incentive spirometer and
pressure support ventilation.

During the hospital course, a history of Guillain-[**Location (un) **]
disease was elicited from the family.  Although the patient
had the disease more than one year ago, pulmonary mechanics
were performed while intubated, and the patient was shown to
have a vital capacity of 1 liter, tidal volume 420.  After
her extubation on [**2147-8-10**], she was continued on BiPAP at
night, and nasal cannula and face [**Date Range **] during the day.  At
the time of dictation, her saturations remained in the high
90s with PO2 above 100, and she was net 8.5 liters negative
since the Swan was pulled, showing a PA diastolic of 15 to
20.  The plan was to continue aggressive diuresis to prevent
further flash pulmonary episodes.

5.  Infectious Disease:  The patient was treated for
enterococcus sensitive to ampicillin and Klebsiella sensitive
to Cipro during her hospital course.  She completed a 12 day
regimen.  There was some concern at the beginning of the
hospital course in which the patient had a high cardiac
output and index and a decreased SVR by Swan-Ganz, which
raised the question of sepsis.  Blood cultures x 4 were all
negative.  Lines were changed frequently, and finally a PICC
line was placed [**2147-8-11**] for long-term intravenous access.

6.  Hematology:  The patient was transfused two units of
packed red blood cells throughout the hospital course, as
well as two units of fresh frozen plasma prior to pacemaker
placement.

7. Renal:  Creatinine bumped only slightly throughout the
hospital course, despite aggressive diuresis.  The plan at
the time of this dictation was to diurese until the patient's
creatinine bumped slightly above 1.2 while still avoiding
acute tubular necrosis.

8.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition/gastrointestinal:  A
swallow study was performed [**2147-8-11**] after being extubated two
days, and the patient was found able to tolerate regular thin
liquid diet.

DISPOSITION:  At the time of dictation, the patient still
remains in the Intensive Care Unit, although long-term plans
will be to transfer to the floor with an extensive
rehabilitation facility stay.  Multiple family discussions
were held during the hospitalization, with the most recent
one [**2147-8-11**] in which the patient herself had decided that, if
the need arose, she would like to be reintubated and, if a
long-term tracheostomy needed to be placed, she was agreeable
to this as well.

A follow-up dictation will be provided to summarize the
remainder of the hospital course.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89-year-old
female with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive
heart failure, status post pacer, who presented acutely with
shortness of breath.  The patient has notably six admissions
for CHF in the last eight months, but most recently she was
admitted from [**Date range (1) 26451**] for CHF exacerbation and stay was
complicated by a non-Q wave MI.  She received stent to the
LAD, left circumflex and had episodes of bradycardia to the
30s which required placement of a dual-chamber pacer, as well
as rapid afib. which was treated with amiodarone.  During the
course of that hospital stay, the patient underwent hypoxic
ventilatory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema
requiring intubation x 3.

The patient eventually recovered and was discharged to
[**Hospital **] Rehabilitation on [**8-22**].  The patient was
transferred home from [**Hospital1 **] on [**9-13**].  At home, the
patient was largely bedridden with no shortness of breath,
stable orthopnea, no PND or lower extremity edema.  The
patient did note cough x a week that was nonproductive and
then was subjectively febrile the night prior to admission.

On the morning of admission, the patient became increasingly
short of breath with nausea and diaphoresis.  No chest pain
and no arm pain.  On arrival in the ED, the patient had a
pulse of 75, blood pressure 91/61, respiratory rate 25,
satting at 100% on a nonrebreather face [**Month/Year (2) **].  It should be
noted that the patient's room air sats were not checked.  The
patient became acutely hypotensive with systolic blood
pressure in the 70s and was placed on a dopamine drip.  Chest
x-ray at that time was consistent with pulmonary edema.  The
patient got 100 of IV lasix with 230 cc of urine output.  ECG
showed a paced rhythm at 75 with a question of ST elevations
in II, III and F, as well as a question of newly positive
axis in V1 and V2 that had previously been negative.

The patient was started on heparin due to concern of acute
coronary syndrome.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for coronary artery
disease, two-vessel disease, status post stents to the LAD
and left circumflex in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year, congestive heart
failure with a known ejection fraction of less than 20%,
moderate-severe mitral regurg, severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis.  The patient also has a history of hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, hypothyroidism, gout, diabetes
mellitus.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco.  No alcohol.  No drugs.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Amiodarone 200 mg po qd, aspirin
325 mg po qd, lisinopril 5 mg po qd, metoprolol 12.5 mg po
tid, Lipitor 5 mg po qd, lasix 60 mg po bid, Synthroid 100
mcg po qd, Zantac 150 mg po bid, Celexa 20 mg po qd, Ambien 5
mg po q hs prn and B12 SC q month.

VITALS ON ARRIVAL IN THE UNIT:  The patient had a temperature
of 99.8, blood pressure of 108/57 on 5 mcg of dopamine, pulse
was 95.  The patient was breathing at 19, satting 98% on a
nonrebreather face [**Month (only) **] and 98% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Generally, the patient was alert and oriented, in no apparent
distress.  Pupils were equal, round and reactive to light.
Oropharynx was clear with dry mucous membranes.  Neck - the
patient had no obvious jugulovenous distention at 30??????.  Chest
- the patient had bilateral crackles in a quarter of the lung
field.  Cardiovascular exam - the patient had a paced rhythm,
normal S1, split S2, no murmur, gallops or rubs, and a
diffuse, anteriorly displaced PMI.  Extremities - the patient
had trace ankle edema bilaterally and dopplerable DP and PT
pulses bilaterally.  Neurologically, the patient was alert
and oriented x 3.

Chest x-ray on admission showed no obvious pacer migration
with mild cephalization of vessels, a small right pleural
effusion and was read as being consistent with mild
congestive heart failure.  ECG showed a paced rhythm at 75
with a wide QRS, positive axis in V1 and V2 that was
previously negative, and a question of ST elevations in leads
II, III and F.  The patient's white count on admission was
17.1 with a differential of 55 neutrophils, 0 bands, 40
lymphocytes.  Hematocrit was 32.8, platelets 382.  The
patient's sodium on admission was 125, K 3.8, BUN and
creatine 34 and 1.5, respectively.  The patient's LFTs were
all within normal limits.  The patient had three sets of
cardiac enzymes in the Emergency Department.  Her highest CK
was 20 and her troponins remained less than 0.3.  She had a
urinalysis that was clear and unremarkable.  No evidence of
UTI.  She also had urine cultures and blood cultures drawn.

IMPRESSION:  In short, this is an 89-year-old female with
CAD, CHF, admitted with subacute shortness of breath, and
presented with hypotension requiring a dopamine drip.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM - 1) CARDIOVASCULAR - CORONARY
ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient on admission was on aspirin,
Lipitor, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor.  Ruled out for MI by
enzymes.  EKG, although there were ST elevations, they were
not considered to be consistent with an ischemic event.  The
patient remained chest pain-free throughout the course of her
stay.

PUMP FUNCTION:  The patient had a known left ventricular
ejection fraction of approximately 20%.  She had a repeat
echo shortly after admission which showed no significant
changes from the previous echo which was done on the [**8-8**].  The patient appeared to be clinically dry.  She was
not hypoxic, had trace crackles only, and trace edema with a
flat JVP.  She was bolused with fluid and was able to be
weaned from the dopamine drip overnight the first night.  The
patient remained hemodynamically stable with blood pressures
largely in the high-80s to low-100s throughout the course of
her stay.  The patient became acutely short of breath two
nights after admission and hypoxic to 90% on 2 liters nasal
cannula.  She was given lasix and diuresed with symptomatic
relief.  A chest x-ray at that time showed congestive heart
failure.  The patient had no further episodes of respiratory
distress throughout the course of her stay.

RHYTHM:  The patient's ECG showed an extremely wide QRS and a
change from left bundle to right bundle morphology in V1 and
V2 which was felt to be more consistent with the patient's
native complex.  Given the question of pacer migration and
hypotension, perforation was ruled out with echo.
Interrogation by EP showed the pacer to be pacing
appropriately without significant migration.

2) INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient presented with a
low-grade fever and an increased white blood cell count, and
an infiltrate versus CHF on chest x-ray.  She was covered
initially with vancomycin and Levofloxacin empirically and
pancultured.  The patient remained afebrile throughout the
course of her stay after the night of admission.  Vancomycin
was discontinued.  All cultures remained negative throughout
admission.  Nevertheless, on her chest x-ray there was also a
question of left lower lobe pneumonia versus atelectasis with
a left-sided pleural effusion.  Thus, the patient was
continued on Levofloxacin.  Pleural effusion was tapped on
the day prior to discharged; results are still pending at the
time of this dictation, but the fluid was clear and serous
appearing.

3) PULMONARY:  After the one hypoxic episode the night after
admission, the patient remained comfortable on room air with
oxygen saturations greater than 95%.

4) RENAL:  The patient presented with a creatinine that was
slightly elevated above her baseline of 0.9-1.2.  Urine
electrolytes were sent suggesting the patient was prerenal.
Urine culture was sent which remained negative throughout the
course of the patient's stay.  The patient had excellent
urine output greater than 30 cc/hr throughout the course of
her stay and responded well to diuresis.  At the time of
discharge, her creatinine had returned to baseline.

5) ENDOCRINE:  The patient was continued on her Synthroid.
Thyroid function tests were sent which showed her TSH to be
elevated, her T4 and free-T4 to be normal, and her T3 to be
low.  This was felt to be consistent with the patient being
started on amiodarone a month prior to this admission for her
afib. and will need follow-up at a later date.

FINAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  1) Congestive heart failure.  2)
Hypotension likely secondary to hypovolemia.  3) Coronary
artery disease.  4) Hypertension.  5) Hypercholesterolemia.
6) Hypothyroidism.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Levofloxacin 500 mg po qd for 9
days, Plavix 75 mg po qd, aspirin 325 mg po qd, digoxin 0.125
mg po qd, captopril 6.25 mg po tid, lasix 60 mg po bid,

The patient was discharged on the ninth.  As of the time of
this dictation, the patient is still deciding whether she
will go home with services or go to acute rehab care.  The
patient should follow-up with her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
89-year-old female with two-vessel coronary artery disease,
congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of less
than 28% and eight admissions for congestive heart failure
exacerbation within the last eight months.  The patient was
most recently admitted from [**2147-7-22**] to [**2147-8-22**]
for CHF exacerbation.  Her stay at that time was complicated
by a non-Q wave MI.  The patient is now status post stents to
her LAD, left circumflex.  The hospital stay was also
complicated by bradycardia to the 30s.  The patient received
a dual-chamber pacer at that time.

The patient's last hospital stay was also complicated by
rapid atrial fibrillation for which she was started on
Amiodarone.  The patient also had a hypoxic ventilatory
failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema requiring three
intubations during her last hospital stay.  The patient
ultimately recovered, however, and was discharged to
rehabilitation on [**2147-8-22**].

The patient had an uneventful recovery at rehabilitation and
was transferred home on [**2147-9-13**].  At home, the
patient has been largely bedridden without complaints of
shortness of breath.  The patient has stable orthopnea and
denied PND or increased lower extremity edema.  The patient
does state that she has had a cough for one week that is
nonproductive and was subjectively febrile the night prior to
admission.

On the morning of admission, the patient states that she
became acutely short of breath with nausea and diaphoresis.
She denied chest or arm pain.  The patient was transferred to
the ED.  The vital signs in the ED were notable for a blood
pressure of 91/60, pulse 75.  The patient was saturating 100%
on nonrebreather.  The patient became transiently hypotensive
to the 70s and was started on a dopamine drip.  The patient
had a chest x-ray that was consistent with pulmonary edema.
She had 100 IV Lasix to which she had 230 cc of urine output.
Her ECG showed paced rhythm at 75 with a question of ST
segment elevations in II, III, and aVF.  The patient was
started on heparin due to concern about acute coronary
syndrome.

Also concerning, the patient had change of axis in some of
her precordial leads.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, as stated in the HPI.
2.  Congestive heart failure with a left ventricular ejection
fraction of less than 20%.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Hypothyroidism.
6.  Gout.
7.  Question of diabetes.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Celexa 40 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Lasix 60 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.
7.  Synthroid 100 micrograms p.o. q.d.
8.  Zantac 150 mg b.i.d.
9.  Lipitor 5 mg p.o. q.d.
10. B12 injection every month.
11. Ambien 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired lawyer.  She denied
any history of tobacco, alcohol, or drug use.  The patient's
family is very supportive.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
99.8, pulse 95, blood pressure 108/57 on 5 micrograms of
dopa.  The patient was saturating 98% on nonrebreather.
General:  She was an alert and oriented female in no apparent
distress.  Not using any accessory muscles.  HEENT:  The
oropharynx was clear with dry mucous membranes.  Neck:  JVP
was actually flat at about 30 degrees.  Chest:  Bilateral
crackles to about a quarter of the lung fields.
Cardiovascular:  Paced with normal S1 and S2, soft S3, no
murmur, and diffuse anteriorly displaced PMI.  Abdomen:
Benign.  Extremities:  She had trace ankle edema bilaterally
and Dopplerable DP and PT pulses bilaterally.  Neurological:
Grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  The chest x-ray showed a small right
pleural effusion, mild cephalization of vessels consistent
with CHF.  No obvious pacer migration compared to the
previous.

The patient had a stat echocardiogram in the ED which showed
a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20%, severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis, no thrombus present, and no
evidence of RV perf.

The patient's laboratories on admission were notable for a
white count of 17.1 with a normal differential, hematocrit
32.8, platelets 382,000.  The electrolytes were notable for a
sodium of 125, potassium 3.8, chloride 87, bicarbonate 26,
BUN 34, creatinine 1.5.  The patient's LFTs were within
normal limits.  The patient had three sets of enzymes.  Her
highest CK was 20 and her troponins were less than 3.  Her
U/A was unremarkable.  Urine cultures and blood cultures were
sent.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is an 89-year-old female
with a history of coronary artery disease and CHF admitted
with shortness of breath and found to be acutely hypotensive
requiring a dopamine drip.  Question if whether the shock is
due to hypovolemia versus sepsis, versus cardiogenic.

1.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient was continued on
her aspirin and Lipitor.  She had three sets of negative
enzymes and was ruled out for MI.  This was not felt to be
consistent with an ischemic event.

2.  PUMP:  The patient has baseline EF of less than 20%.
There is no change on her admission echocardiogram compared
to her echocardiogram from [**2147-8-8**].  The patient
appeared clinically dry and was bolused with fluid.  The
patient's blood cultures remained negative throughout the
course of her admission and no potential source for infection
to lead to sepsis as an etiology was ever elucidated.

There was concern given the change of axis in the precordial
leads that her pacer may have migrated and she may have
sustained an RV perf; however, her pacer was interrogated and
found to be fine and there was no evidence of echocardiogram
of any right ventricular perforation and no evidence on chest
x-ray that the pacer leads had migrated.

Hypoadrenalism was also considered as possible etiology for
this patient's hypotension; however, she was started on
stress dose steroids and underwent a cortisol stim test.
These revealed that her pituitary adrenal access was
functioning normally with no evidence of hypoadrenalism to
explain the patient's hypotension.

Ultimately, the patient was bolused with fluid, weaned from
dopamine and it was decided that the patient was probably
hypovolemic.  The patient had no further episodes of
hypotension once she was weaned from the dopamine and fluid
resuscitated.  The patient was continued on her ACE inhibitor
and her beta blocker as well as her regular dose of b.i.d.
Lasix.

3.  RHYTHM:  Given the change in axis of the patient's
precordial leads, there was concern that her pacer may be
malfunctioning; however, the pacer was interrogated by EP who
found that her pacer was functioning appropriately.  The
patient had no further rhythm issues throughout the course of
her hospitalization and was continued on Amiodarone for her
history of atrial fibrillation.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient remained afebrile
throughout the course of her admission. She never had any
culture data that was positive; however, pneumonia could not
be excluded based on her chest x-ray.  Thus, the patient was
started on Levaquin for a 14 day course which she continued
after discharge.

5.  PULMONARY:  The patient was able to be weaned to room air
rather quickly.  She did develop a solitary left-sided
pleural effusion which was tapped and found to be
transudative and thought likely due to congestive heart
failure.

6.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient's TSH was elevated at 8.3 on
admission.  Her T3 and FT4 were checked.  It was thought that
her thyroid abnormalities were probably due to starting
Amiodarone recently and should be followed-up on in the next
month.

7.  RENAL:  The patient had some element of acute renal
failure on admission, likely secondary to dehydration.  Her
creatinine decreased back to her baseline with hydration.

The patient was discharged in good condition on [**2147-9-26**].
She is scheduled to follow-up with her primary care doctor,
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**], in the next two weeks.

Brief Hospital Course:
On admission to the CCU, an [**Month/Day/Year 461**] was notable for a
dilated left ventricle and severely depressed LVEF of around
20%. Chest and head CT scans were also obtained. The chest scan
revealed diffuse ground glass opacities and bilateral lower lobe
air space disease. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
The head scan was remarkable for two foci of low attenuation,
one within the right subcortical temporal lobe white matter, and
one within the right medial temporal lobe. Both of these may
represent areas of lacunar infarction.

He was concomitantly noted to have a leukocytosis and spiked a
fever to 102.0. He was empirically started on broad spectrum
antibiotics. Pan cultures remained negative. He also experienced
a transient decline in renal function with creatinine peaking to
2.4. Within days, his renal function normalized and his
hypoxia/acidosis improved. He maintained stable hemodynamics and
was eventually extubated on hospital day two. No further
ventricular arrhythmias were noted on telemetry and he remained
pain free. His CK-MB and troponin peaked to 70 and 1.5
respectively.

On [**12-26**], cardiac catheterization revealed severe three
vessel coronary artery disease in a right dominant system. The
left main demonstrated mild diffuse disease. The LAD had a 70%
stenosis after the 1st Diagonal. The D1 was totally occluded and
filled via left to left collaterals. The LCX demonstrates a 40%
proximal lesion along with a totally occluded OM2 that filled
via left to left collaterals. The RCA demonstrated a 70%
proximal lesion along with a total occlusion
of the distal vessel that filled via left to right collaterals.
Repeat [**Month (only) 461**] again showed moderately to severely
depressed left ventricular systolic function of approximately
30-35%. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities included
inferior/inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis and distal septal
and apical hypokinesis. There was only mild mitral regurgitation
and mild aortic insufficiency.

He was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for CABG when he was medically
ready to go to the OR. He remained in the CCU prior to his
surgery initially and then was transferred to the floor. His
rising WBCs was an issue that prevented him from going to the OR
earlier. There was a question of an aspiration PNA and he
completed abx. Blood and urine cultures were negative. Heparin
turned off several days before surgery. He underwent CABG x3 on
[**1-8**]. He was seen on [**1-9**] by the EP service for evaluation for
possible ICD. It was determined he could see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
one month as an outpatient. Swan and chest tubes were removed on
POD #1. He was extubated and was alert and oriented. He remained
on an amiodarone loading drip and the neo drip was weaned off on
POD #2. He was transferred to the floor in the afternoon.

On the floor he developed a rash on his RUE where the BP cuff
had been. He was given benadryl and lidex cream and had a
dermatology consult. He remained in SR and the amiodarone was
DCed. His leukocytosis was improving and he had no evidence of
active infection. Ibuprofen had been started for a pericardial
rub, but this was stopped the next day when his creatinine rose
to 1.6. This decreased to 1.0 the next day. He had a small
hematoma at the left thigh. Flomax was started for complaints of
difficulty urinating. Diuresis and beta blockade continued and
he was cleared for discharge to home with VNA on [**1-14**].

History of Present Illness:
This is a 49 year-old male with history of diabetes,
hypertension, and end stage renal disease who was transfered
from an outside hospital after a PEA arrest.  For the past week,
he has been feeling unwell.  One week ago, he underwent
placement of a perotoneal dialysis catheter.  At that time, he
required hospital admission for 2 days due to hyperkalemia and
hyperglycemia.  He was not dialysed at that time.  He had
persistent nausea.  The day prior to admission, he was back to
his baseline health, which is severe fatigue with ambulation of
a few yards.  The morning of presentation, he began to feel
nauseated.  Per report, he fell from his chair and was
unresponsive.  He had some jerking movements of his arms that
were similar to his hypoglycemic episodes.  Shortly thereafter,
he was responsive but then became unresponsive again.  When EMS
arrived, he was found to be bradycardic in PEA arrest.  He
received epi and atropine.  He subsequently became hypotensive
to the 60s systolic and was asystolic.  He was transcutaneously
paced.  He was taken to an outside hospital where he continued
to be hypotensive.  He received 4 L of IV fluid resuscitation.
A temporary pacer was placed, and he was paced at 80 beats per
minute.  Without pacing, he had only rare junctional escape
beats.  His labs were notable for hyperkalemia to 6.2,
hyperglycemia to the 700s, and acidemia with a pH of 7.03.
Cardiac enzymes were negative and his BNP was elevated to [**2175**].
An echocardiogram revealed an EF of 15-20% with global
hypokinesis and decreased right ventricular function.  He was
transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  On transfer,
his vent settings were noted to be incorrect and he was found to
be hypoxic to the 50s on 2 separate gases about 1.5 hours apart.
 On arrival he was oxygenating well.  He was on 5 mcg of
levophed to maintain his blood pressure.  He was intially
unresponsive, with fixed dilated pupils, with an absent corneal
and gag reflex.  An initial potassium was 6.4.  He received
calcium, bicarb, insulin, and kayexelate.  He was admitted to
the CCU.

Past Medical History:
1. Insulin dependant diabetes diagnosed 20 years ago.
2. End stage renal disease for about 1.5 years with plans to
start perironeal dialysis next month.  A PD catheter was placed
last week.
3. Hypertension
4. Hyperlipidemia
5. History of lens removal in left eye.
6. History of TIA


Social History:
He is currently not working.  He is married and has 2 children.
He smokes 1 pack per day.  He doesn't drink alcohol.

Family History:
His mother has a triple bypass in her 60s.  She also has
diabetes and hypertension.

pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions, coronary
arteries grossly clean.
.
EKG: Ventricular paced at 80 bpm with left bundle morphology.
EKG with underlying rhythm: narrow complex escape beats at
50-60.
.
TTE [**2182-5-21**]:
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed. LVEF 40% Distal
anterior, apical, and distal inferior hypokinesis is present.

.
.
Exercise stress test: [**2182-5-22**]
The baseline EKG showed prominant voltage, diffuse STT wave
abnormalities and LAE. No additional, significant ST segment
changes
over baseline were observed during the infusion or in recovery.
The
rhythm was sinus with no ectopy. Appropriate blood pressure
response to
the infusion; blunted heart rate response. The dipyridamole was
reversed with 125 mg of aminophylline IV.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or significant EKG changes
over
baseline. Nuclear report sent separately.

PERSANTINE MIBI  [**2182-5-22**]
RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
3.1 mCi Tl-201 Thallous Chloride;
21.0 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Sestamibi;
HISTORY: Diabetes, ESRD, and hypertension, status post
hyperkalemia-related cardiac arrest. CAD evaluation.
SUMMARY OF THE PRELIMINARY REPORT FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:
Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose
of 0.142
milligram/kilogram/min. Two minutes after the cessation of
infusion, Tc-99m
sestamibi was administered IV.
INTERPRETATION:
Image Protocol: Gated SPECT
Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium.
Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting
images.
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial
perfusion model.

The image quality is adequate.

Left ventricular cavity size is dilated, and more dilated at
stress than at
rest.

Resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake
throughout the
myocardium.

Gated images reveal diffuse hypokinesis without focal wall
motion abnormalities.The calculated left ventricular ejection
fraction is 48%

IMPRESSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 2. Transient
dilitation of the left ventricle during dipyridamole (stress)
images compared to rest, with a
baseline dilated left ventricle.


Brief Hospital Course:
49 year-old male with diabetes, end-stage renal disease,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia admitted with cardiac arrest likely
secondary to hyperkalemia and acidemia.
.
1. Cardiac arrest: Patient had an asystolic arrest in the
setting of hyperkalemia to 6.4 and acidemia to 7.0.  On arrival,
he was 100% paced with an underlying rhythm of 50-60s junctional
escapes.  He was also hypotensive requiring Levophed.  He was
treated for hyperkalemia in the emergency department with
calcium gluconate, bicarb, insulin, and Kayexalate.  His mental
status improved with treatment of hyperkalemia.  His EKG with
back-up pacing at a rate of 40 showed heart block with
occasional conducted beats with AV delay.  There was also some
inappropriate pacing spikes.  The sensing was decreased with
good effect.  He subsequently converted to normal sinus rhythm
without AV delay as his potassium was corrected.  His blood
pressure also improved with treatment of his hyperkalemia.  He
is currently off of Levophed. Patient had a repeat TTE which
demonstrated an improvement in his EF to 40%. Temporary pacer
was discontinued on [**2182-5-20**]. Patient did not have further
evidence of arrythmia. He will have close follow-up locally and
he will have his PCP refer him to a local cardiologist.
.
2. Chronic renal failure: secondary to diabetes and
hypertension. At the OSH the patient had a catheter placed with
the goal of starting peritoneal dialysis in 1 month. However,
during that hospitalization, he then developed hyperkalemia and
subsequent PEA arrest, which required transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].He was
dialyzed on the night of admission and had two additional
sessions of hemodialysis while in-house. Tunneled dialysis line
placed [**5-22**] and out-pt hemodialysis was coordinated; he has
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] his nephrologist on [**2182-5-25**].
.
3. Diabetes: He was hyperglycemic to 700s initially without any
evidence of ketosis.  He received insulin and was started on an
insulin drip.  He was requiring 1 unit per hour.  On hospital
day 2, he was transitioned to NPH and the insulin drip was
weaned off. He was discharged on a regimen of glargine and
lispro.
.
3. Congestive Heart Failure: At the outside hospital, he had an
echocardiogram that showed diffused hypokinesis with an ejection
fraction of 15-20%.  It also showed decreased right ventricular
function.  According to his wife, he had a normal echocardiogram
on month prior.  Repeat ECHO at [**Hospital1 18**] showed at EF of 40%. His
EF may continue to improve following this event.  He should have
a repeat ECHO in the next several months.
.
4. Elevation in cardiac enzymes: On admit, he had a troponin
leak that was likely secondary to hypotension in the setting of
his arrest.  Also, noted to have elevated CK-MB. Enzymes trended
down during his admission. He did not have a cath while he was
here. He will discuss elective cardiac catheterization at
follow-up with his PCP and primary cardiologist.
.
6. Hypertension:  Was briefly on pressors, then as pressure came
up required Nitro for blood pressure control  (initially
avoiding nodal blocking agents). Additional agents were slowly
added back and he was discharged on a regimen of Procardia,
labetalol and lisinopril.  Blood pressure will be followed by
PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) **] regimen will be titrated up as
necessary.
.
7. Intubation: He was intubated for airway protection at the
OSH. As his electrolyte disturbances resolved, ventilation and
sedation were weaned. He was extubated on hospital day 2. He did
not have any additional respiratory issues.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 1637**] is a 69 year old
female with a history of coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft following a non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction in [**2124-1-1**], and also history
of type I diabetes, presenting with unstable angina. The
patient had done well from coronary artery bypass graft until
[**2124-10-30**] when she began to experience angina again.
She was taken to the catheterization laboratory at that point
where she was found to have left anterior descending lesions
which were not amenable to intervention at that time and the
case was complicated by two dissections. Following that the
patient had an escalated pattern of angina until 2 days prior
to admission when the patient experienced angina at rest. Her
angina is experienced as a chest heaviness with pain
radiating to the left arm.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2123**] wit saphenous vein graft to patent
ductus arteriosus and saphenous vein graft to left anterior
descending, left internal mammary artery to diagonal,
saphenous vein graft to an OM. Catheterization on [**11-2**]
showed stump occlusion of saphenous vein graft to the left
anterior descending with failed intervention, stump occlusion
saphenous vein graft to the patent ductus arteriosus, patent
left internal mammary artery to the diagonal and patent
saphenous vein graft to the OM.
2.  Type 1 diabetes mellitus.
3.  IgG Monoclonal gammopathy.
4.  Osteoporosis.
5.  Status post TH for leiomyoma.
6.  Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Actonel 35 mg po q week.
2.  Aspirin 81 mg po once daily.
3.  Insulin NPH 18 units in the morning and 8 units in the
evening. Regular insulin 8 units in the morning and 2 units
at dinner.
4.  Imdur 30 mg three times a day.
5.  Lipitor 10 mg po once daily.
6.  Lisinopril 40 mg po once daily.
7.  Metformin 500 mg po twice a day
8.  Plavix 75 mg po once daily
9.  Toprol-XL 50 mg po once daily

ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives alone in [**Location (un) 3307**].  No tobacco,
alcohol or drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.9, blood pressure 94/33, pulse
60, respiratory rate 16, saturating at 99 percent on room
air.
LUNGS: Clear.
HEART:  Unremarkable without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
EXTREMITY:  She had no lower extremity edema.

LABORATORY DATA: On admission laboratory data was notable for
sodium of 132, glucose of 272, normal creatinine, normal
coags, and normal CK with a troponin of 0.02.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**1-22**] initially which demonstrated
20 percent left main left anterior descending calcified with
95 percent osteal stenosis in the mid and distal vessel
within the distal left anterior descending, circumflex had
diffuse disease with 60 percent osteal stenosis and 80
percent long stenosis between the OM2 and OM3, right coronary
artery had moderate degree disease and saphenous vein graft
to OM2 was widely patent but with severe disease again
between the OM2 and OM3. She had a hepico stent deployed in
the mid left anterior descending but the distal left anterior
descending was small and diffusely diseased and not amenable
to stenting. She had following that an episode of nausea, and
the next morning had recurrent episode of chest pain
radiating to the left arm. Electrocardiogram showed slight ST
elevations in V2, V3 with inverted T waves in V4, V5, V6, and
the patient was hypotensive to the 70's.  The patient had no
sign or symptoms of congestive heart failure while in
hospital.  She was treated with 20 mg of Lasix po once daily
and given her orthostasis until the day prior to discharge
she had persistent low blood pressure. On the day of
discharge her Lasix was discontinued.

She was taken back to the cardiac catheterization laboratory
where the stent into the left anterior descending was opened
but there was again diffuse vessel disease. Another stent was
deployed within that previously patent stent. Also the
patient was noted to have a decreased cardiac index at 1.98
and to be profoundly acidotic.

An intraaortic balloon pump was placed after administration
of Dopamine. She was noted to have decreased ejection
fraction of approximately 30 percent. The patient was
transferred to the CCU where she was found to have ketones
and determined to be in diabetic ketoacidosis.  The pressors
were aptly weaned off.  The balloon pump was weaned within 24
hours. The patient was transported back to the floor.  Of
note the patient had CK pump to the 700s following a second
event and repeat echocardiogram demonstrated new ejection
fraction of approximately 25 percent. Thereafter the patient
remained chest pain free while in house, however her blood
pressure remained tenuous and she was orthostatic until the
day of discharge. For that reason her beta blocker and ACE
inhibitor were decreased to 12.5 mg of atenolol and 2.5 mg of
lisinopril.  It was felt that there were likely no further
interventions possible on this patient given difficulties in
the catheterization state. She was continued on aspirin,
Plavix, atorvastatin, and Warfarin was initiated for
decreased ejection fraction of 25 percent with a target INR
of 2.

ENDOCRINE:  The patient is a type 1 diabetic and the morning
following her initial cardiac catheterization she refused her
insulin.  NOHA staff was notified and the patient
subsequently went into diabetic ketoacidosis. She was treated
in the Intensive Care Unit with insulin and fluids and
electrolytes and the acidosis rapidly resolved and she had no
further complications of diabetes during her hospital stay.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  In addition to the cardiac
catheterization as mentioned previously the patient had
several echocardiograms, the last of which was done on
[**1-26**], which was 3 days after her second cardiac
catheterization. This demonstrated moderately dilated left
ventricular cavity. Severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis with basal inferolateral akinesis, mid
inferolateral akinesis, and lateral apex was akinetic without
an effusion. 1+ mitral regurgitation and normal RV function.
The patient had a peak CK of 765 on [**1-24**] and chest
x-ray on [**1-25**], showed mild cardiomegaly and minimal
perihilar haziness in upper lobe redistribution.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease, likely not amenable to further
intervention status post left anterior descending stents x 2.
2.  Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction 25
percent.
3.  Type 1 diabetes mellitus.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Anticoagulation for low ejection fraction.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atorvastatin 10 mg po once daily
2.  Plavix 25 mg po once daily
3.  Pantoprazole 40 mg po once daily
4.  Aspirin 325 mg po once daily
5.  Metoprolol XL 12.5
6.  Warfarin 5 mg qhs [**1-29**] and [**1-30**] and then 2 mg thereafter to
have an INR  checked on [**2125-2-1**], targeting an INR of 2.0.
7.  Insulin NPH 18 units in the morning and 8 units in the
evening, Regular insulin sliding scale
8.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg po once daily.

FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS:
The patient has follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**2-2**] and he should call her usual cardiologist for an
appointment within one to two weeks.

28 per EMS.  The patient was treated with a half amp of D50 with
improvement.  No nausea vomiting, chest pain, shortness of
breath, palpitations, or extremity pain.  patient takes
coumadin.

She had taken her normal breakfast and then went to the doctor
for a blood draw.  she did not have her usual mid morning snack,
and blacked out while driving home

Pertinent Results:
CTA Chest/abdomen and pelvis [**2125-4-23**]:
IMPRESSION:
1) Bilateral patchy diffuse ground-glass opacities consistent
with failure.
2) Small right pleural effusions and trace left effusion.
3) No evidence of dissection.
4) No free fluid in the abdomen or solid organ injury.

CT head [**2125-4-23**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Findings consistent with old right parietal lobe infarction

CT c-spine [**2125-4-23**]:
There is no evidence of fracture or abnormal alignment of the
component vertebrae. The vertebral bodies and intervertebral
disc space height are preserved. There are atherosclerotic
changes with calcifications within the region of the common
carotid bifurcations. There is also note of biapical ground
glass opacities within the lungs- apparently, the patient is in
cardiac failure, as you indicated to us by telephone.

ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. Resting
regional wall
motion abnormalities include akinesis of the [**Doctor Last Name **] [**1-2**]'s of th LV
sparing the
base and the lateral wall.. These remaining left ventricular
segments are
hypokinetic. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular
systolic function is normal. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There iis an echogenic density in the right
ventricle consistent
with a pacemaker lead. There is no pericardial effusion present.
 Ejection Fraction: 15% to 20%


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the surgical ICU on [**2125-4-23**] for
neurologic and hemodynamic monitoring.  He was kept NPO and was
seen by cardiology.  They recognized that the primary problem
was hypoglycemia, and any shortness of breath that the patient
had was related to IV fluid administration, and they suggested a
gentle diuresis.  He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
the medical team felt that the CHF was attributed to the
resuscitation at the trauma, but also that the patient needed
diabetes teaching, especailly with respect to diet and
nutrition.  ON [**4-25**], the patients volume status had improved
and his heartfailure had also imrovoved.  He was on all of his
home meds.  There was a long session of counseling regarding
diabetes management, was told to check her glucose before
driving and the patients hemodynamic stauts was at its baseline
by [**2125-4-26**].  she was able to be discharged at her baseline
in stable condition

Chief Complaint:
S/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
trochanteric fixation nail repair
cardiac catheteization
PICC line placement and removal


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of Type 1
diabetes, systolic heart failure, coronary artery disease s/p
MIs and CABG who presented to the Emergency Department after
falling down the 4 steps of her house while trying to get to her
car. According to interviewers in the ED, the patient had no
loss of consciousness and the narrative was one of mechanical
fall. Following the fall, the patient had hip pain and
deformity.

In the ED, the patient was waiting in triage when she became
hypoxic to 80s despite supplemental oxygen and her lungs had
crackles throughout. The patient has a history of systolic CHF
requiring diuresis. The patient's chest X-ray was consistent
with pulmonary edema (likely flashed) with RA saturation in the
70s and low 90s on non-rebreather. The physicians in the ED
decided to intubate the patient, which was completed without
complication. The patient was originally on nitroglycerin gtt,
Versed/Fentanyl, but the compbination of the sedatives and the
nitroglycerin made her hypotensive so the nitroglycerin was
stopped. The patient still gets hyypotensive with boluses for
[**Last Name (LF) 31158**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was started on dopamine. Also in the ED, the
patient was pan-CT scanned, and her only injury is a left femur
fracture. Orthopedics would like to surgically correct but want
medical clearance first. Her vitals upon leaving the ED were Hr
76, BP 110/48, 100% saturation on ventilation.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was sedated and intubated
but responsive. She was motuhing words but could not be
understood secondary to the endotracheal tube.

CXR [**3-1**]:Single supine portable view of the chest was obtained.
The
endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm above the level
of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level
of the diaphragm, with the side port at the GE junction and
distal tip likely terminating within the stomach, suggest
advancement so that the side port is well within the stomach.
Extensive bilateral perihilar opacities likely relate to edema,
although underlying consolidation may also be present. No large
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The patient is status
post median sternotomy and CABG.  Left-sided AICD is stable in
position.
.
CT spine [**3-1**]:
1. No fracture or subluxation.
2. Bilateral lung apices opacifications better evaluated on the
concurrent CT of the chest.
.
CT head [**3-1**]:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Chronic right parietal infarct.
3. Moderate-to-severe small vessel disease and atherosclerotic
calcifications
of the carotid arteries
.
CT A/P [**3-1**]:
1. Acute left intertrochanteric femoral fracture with adjacent
hematoma
2. Diffuse ground-glass opacities in both lungs consistent with
pulmonary
edema and bilateral posterior lung opacifications likely
representing
atelectatic changes, less likely aspiration or contusion.
3. No acute vascular or visceral injury. No evidence of aortic
injury and no pulmonary embolism.
4. Left lateral 7th rib fracture seen on radiograph from this
same date
([**2133-3-1**]) is not visualized on CT, however this might be
related to technical reasons
.
Hip XR [**3-1**]: IMPRESSION: Left intertrochanteric fracture.
.
Echo [**3-2**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the sepum, inferior, and inferolateral walls. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction suggestive of
multivessel CAD (LAD and PDA distribution). Mild mitral
regurgitation. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Incresaed PCWP.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2125-4-23**], left ventricular systolic function is
now improved and the estimated PA systolic pressure is now
lower.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo woman with h/o DM1, CAD, CHF admitted for left hip
fracture and acute congestive heart failure requiring
intubation.
.
# Ischemic cardiomyopathy: Acute on chronic systolic and
diastolic heart failure.
-Patient was diuresed, and her symptoms improved. She briefly
required intubation.  The patient spent time on several services
while in-house, and at one point there was concern for an acute
ST elevation on EKGs, so she was taken to the cardiac cath lab.
At that time, chronic total occlusion of her LAD was diagnosed,
and no intervention was performed.  The patient will need her
heart failure regimen titrated while at rehab, including ACE-I,
beta-blocker and diuretics.  She needs additional diuresis
acutely, which should be performed at rehab.  Additionally,
given her chronic angina and CAD, she may benefit from renexa as
an outpatient, and her imdur should be increased as tolerated.
.
# Femur fx-s/p internal fixation:
-Occured in setting of mechanical fall.  The patient underwent
uncomplicated repair with placement of nail by orthopaedics.
Due to intra-operative blood loss, she required transfusion of
blood products.  She was discharged to an acute rehab facility
for additional physical therapy.
.
# Hyponatremia:
-Most likely secondary to pain induced SIADH, coupled with
hypervolemic hyponatremia. This improved with pain medication
and diuresis.  In the future, she may benefit from a vaptan
.
# Type I DM:
-Her insulin regimen was titrated in house based on finger
sticks and changing PO intake.
.

Transitional issues:
-Renexa should be considered as anti-anginal
-Titrate ACE-I, beta-blocker, and diuretic (torsemide)
-Restart aldactone as tolerated

Date of Birth:   [**2035-9-3**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of
hypertension and increased cholesterol who was in her usual
state of health until approximately 8 p.m. when she noted the
sudden onset of ripping chest pain radiating to her back.
The patient fell to the floor; however, she denies any loss
of consciousness.

Emergency Medical Service arrive at the scene and found her
diaphoretic with a blood pressure of 60/palp, heart rate
of 55, saturations of 98% on room air.  The patient was given
2 liters of normal saline bolus and was brought to the
Emergency Room.

At that time, her blood pressure was 100/palp in the
Emergency Room at [**Hospital6 3105**].  The patient
with chest pain.  Blood pressure was 70/palp, heart rate of
80s to 90s.  Electrocardiogram with ST elevations in II, III,
and aVF.  The patient was given Retavase 10 mg/10 cc at
8:45 p.m. and was started on a dopamine drip; initially at 7
and increased to 10.  The patient was given a heparin
4000-unit bolus and was started on 900 units per hour; at
which point, given persistent chest pain and ST elevations,
the patient was given a second dose of Retavase 10 mg/10 cc
at 9:15.  Subsequently, she had reperfusion ectopy with five
seconds of atrial fibrillation and was shocked at 300 joules
into sinus rhythm.  The patient was given an amiodarone bolus
at 150 mg and was started on an amiodarone drip at 1 mg per
minute.  Given her persistent hypotension and need for
dopamine was increased to 20.

The patient was taken to the catheterization laboratory for
an intra-aortic balloon pump placement; at which time the
blood pressure and heart rate improved, and the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On arrival to the [**Hospital1 **]
catheterization laboratory (at approximately 1:30 a.m.), the
patient with a blood pressure of 120/60 and heart rate of 80.
The patient was noted to have a brisk bleed from her groin;
at which time fluoroscope revealed a kink in a sheath in the
arterial balloon pump, and the patient's intra-aortic balloon
pump was removed and pressure was held.

At this time, the electrocardiogram on arrival showed
resolution of the ST elevations in II, III, and aVF.
Vascular Surgery was consulted when there was noted absent
pulses in the right lower extremity.  Subsequent to this
pressure applied to the groin the patient became bradycardic
with 2:1 block and hypotensive and was started on atropine
and dopamine, and a transvenous pacing wire was placed; at
which point 4-mm to 5-mm ST elevations were noted in the
inferior leads.  The patient was prepped for cardiac
catheterization.

Left cardiac catheterization revealed total occlusion of the
proximal right coronary artery; at which time a 2.5-mm X
18-mm stent was placed with good flow achieved distally.  The
patient developed ventricular tachycardia times two on the
table and was bolused with lidocaine and started on a
lidocaine drip.  Amiodarone was discontinued.  The patient
had a right heart catheterization at this time also which
revealed pulmonary artery pressures of 37/24, wedge of 25,
right atrial mean of 25, right ventricular of 35/19,
pulmonary artery saturation of 48%, cardiac output of 2.9,
cardiac index of 1.7, and systemic vascular resistance
of 800.  An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the left
groin, and dopamine and Levophed were started.  The patient
with persistent junctional rhythm and hypotension.

The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit after
the catheterization laboratory.  In the Coronary Care Unit,
the patient had a pulse of 70.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  An elderly white
female, intubated and sedated, afebrile, pulse of 70, blood
pressure of 68/37, satting 100% on AC 40%, tidal volume
of 600, rate of 14, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.
Intra-aortic balloon pump with assisted systole of 64,
augmented diastole of 53, set at 1:1.  The patient on
dopamine at 20, Levophed at 20, and lidocaine at 2.  On head,
eyes, ears, nose, and neck examination pupils were equally
round and reactive to light.  The oropharynx was clear with
an endotracheal tube in place, jugular venous pulse not
visualized.  Chest examination showed scattered wheezes and
coarse breath sounds bilaterally.  Cardiovascular revealed a
regular rate.  No murmurs.  The abdominal examination
revealed bowel sounds positive, soft and nontender.
Extremities revealed there was a right groin hematoma, and
the right lower extremity dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibialis pulses were dopplerable but not palpable.  On
neurologic examination, the patient was sedated.  Pupils were
reactive.  Left groin had a Swan and an intra-aortic balloon
pump in place.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission from the outside hospital revealed a white blood
cell count of 11.3, hematocrit of 46, platelets of 280.
Troponin there was 0.2 with a creatine kinase of 77.  SMA-7
with sodium of 140, potassium of 3.3, chloride of 103,
bicarbonate of 24, blood urea nitrogen of 17, creatinine
of 1.3, glucose of 240.  Liver function tests were slightly
elevated.  Laboratories at 2:30 a.m. showed a hematocrit
of 31.3, at 3 a.m. showed a hematocrit of 26.  The patient's
SMA-7 at 2:30 a.m. revealed a bicarbonate of 16 with an anion
gap of 12.  Arterial blood gas revealed pH of 7.28, PCO2
of 31, PO2 of 240.  The patient's lactate level was 8.9,
glucose to 578.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram at 8:20 revealed sinus
bradycardia at 48, frequent premature atrial contractions, ST
elevations in II, III, and aVF, V4 to V6, ST elevations in V1
and V2.

Electrocardiogram at 1:30 a.m. revealed sinus rhythm at 85, Q
waves in III and aVF, T wave inversions and resolution of ST
elevations to 1-mm in II, III, and aVF.

Electrocardiogram at 4:45 a.m. again revealed T wave
inversions, and Q waves, 2-mm to 3-mm ST elevations in II,
III, and aVF.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 69-year-old female admitted
with an acute inferior myocardial infarction complicated by
cardiogenic shock; now status post right coronary artery
stent with an intra-aortic balloon pump in place, on
pressors.

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  (a)  Ischemia:  The patient with an
acute myocardial infarction, status post right coronary
artery stent.  The patient's creatine kinases were cycled.
Maximum creatine kinase in the 3000 range; which maximized on
day two and then subsequently trended back to normal.  The
patient was started on aspirin, and Plavix, and Lipitor.
When blood pressure tolerated, the patient was weaned off the
intra-aortic balloon pump and pressors.  The patient was
started on Lopressor, and eventually the patient was started
on captopril.  The patient able to tolerate this regimen.
The patient was chest pain free throughout her stay.  She did
not require any further nitroglycerin.

(b)  Pump:  The patient with cardiogenic shock secondary to
inferior wall infarct and right ventricular failure.  The
patient initially with an intra-aortic balloon pump placed at
the outside hospital which was removed in the catheterization
laboratory, and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in
our catheterization laboratory.  The patient was also on
Levophed initially for pressor support.  The patient was
heparinized for the intra-aortic balloon pump.  The patient
remained on the balloon pump for two to three days.
Eventually, the patient was able to wean off her Levophed.

Echocardiogram on the following morning revealed an ejection
fraction of 20% to 30% with inferior and septal hypokinesis.
The patient was initially kept positive to insure an good
blood pressure; however, eventually the patient was
overloaded and needed to be diuresed.  The patient was given
Lasix p.r.n. but eventually was able to manage an auto
diuresis, maintaining maps above 60 off pressors.  The
patient's cardiogenic shock improved, and the patient
eventually was able to be restarted on blood pressure
medications such as Lopressor and captopril prior to
discharge.  Heparin was discontinued after platelets started
to fall and the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed.

(c)  Electrophysiology:  The patient initially with
ventricular fibrillation at the outside hospital, status post
cardioversion.  The patient was then in ventricular
tachycardia in the catheterization laboratory.  The patient
was started on a lidocaine drip which was eventually turned
off.  On hospital day three, the patient went into atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate into the 160s.  The
patient was loaded with amiodarone, attempted direct current
cardioversion time two unsuccessfully.  However, after the
patient was switched over to an amiodarone drip, the patient
converted into sinus rhythm.  The patient was eventually
converted to p.o. amiodarone 400 mg b.i.d. times five days
then 400 mg p.o. q.d.  The patient will be discharged on
amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d. times six week.  The patient was
able to maintain a normal sinus rhythm throughout the rest of
her hospital course.

2.  PULMONARY:  The patient was intubated at the outside
hospital.  On arrival, the patient was mechanically
ventilated at AC 700, rate of 12, 100%, no positive
end-expiratory pressure.  The patient's course, pulmonary
wise, was also complicated by thick secretions and a question
of aspiration pneumonia.  The patient was initially started
on Levaquin and clindamycin intravenously and eventually grew
out Staphylococcus aureus in her sputum which was sensitive
to both Levaquin and clindamycin.  The patient continued
intubated when multiple weaning trial were unsuccessful
secondary to increased oxygen demand, secondary to thick
secretions and pneumonia.

However, after approximately six days on the ventilator (on
hospital day six), the patient was successfully weaned and
extubated.  Post extubation was complicated by some stridor
with laryngeal edema.  The patient was started on intravenous
Solu-Medrol with some helio oxygen for further oxygen
delivery, and the patient was eventually switched over to
p.o. prednisone with a rapid taper.  The patient will
continue this rapid taper as an outpatient supplemented with
albuterol nebulizers and meter-dosed inhaler.  The patient
continued to be treated for her pneumonia with Levaquin and
clindamycin.  Upon discharge, the patient was maintaining
stable saturations on 2 liters nasal cannula

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was initially afebrile
on arrival; however, after intubation on hospital day three,
the patient spiked fevers to 102.4.  The patient was
pan-cultured and eventually started on Levaquin empirically.
Given the patient's persistent fevers, clindamycin was
supplemented.  The patient eventually grew out Staphylococcus
aureus in her sputum and Escherichia coli in her urine, which
were both pan-sensitive.  The patient was treated for her
Staphylococcus pneumonia and Escherichia coli urinary tract
infection with a 14-day course of Levaquin and clindamycin;
to be continued and finished as an outpatient.  The patient
was afebrile for the last three days of her hospital stay.

4.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient with a drop in her hematocrit
from 46 to 31 upon arrival.  The patient with an expanding
hematoma in her right groin.  The patient was transfused 3
units STAT upon arrival to the floor and an additional 2
units to 3 units during her hospital course to maintain her
hematocrits.  The patient eventually had a CT scan of her
abdomen and pelvis to rule out a retroperitoneal or femoral
hematoma.  No retroperitoneal hematoma was found; however,
the patient was found to have a 5-cm right common femoral
artery pseudoaneurysm.  The patient was taken to
Interventional Radiology for an ultrasound-guided thrombin
injection of the pseudoaneurysm with good result.  The
patient's hematocrit remained stable throughout her stay.
Vascular was following; however, they did not intervene.  The
patient to have a repeat femoral ultrasound prior to
discharge.  The patient regained good pulses in her lower
extremities and with no loss of sensation or neurologic
function.

The patient's platelets were initially 200 on arrival and
dropped precipitously to 70, then 50, then 40.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibody was sent.  Heparin
was discontinued.  However, as the intra-aortic balloon pump
was pulled on hospital day four, the patient's platelets
improved; likely thrombocytopenia was secondary to
intra-aortic balloon pump; heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
antibody had yet to return upon discharge.

5.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient was initially
intubated.  The patient started tube feeds.  Nutrition was
consulted.  The patient maintained on tube feeds while
intubated.  When the patient was extubated, the patient was
slowly able to start taking clears and eventually a
mechanical soft diet prior to discharge.

6.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient with elevated sugars in the
setting of an acute myocardial infarction.  The patient was
initially started on an insulin drip; however, after 24 hours
was switched over to regular insulin sliding-scale with
normalization of her sugars status post myocardial
infarction.

7.  LINES:  The patient initially with a right internal
jugular triple lumen, femoral Swan.  The Swan was pulled on
hospital day two.  The right internal jugular triple lumen
also pulled while the patient was febrile.  Radial arterial
line also pulled.  All cultures were negative.  The patient
was eventually switched over to peripherals and discharged
without any lines in place, as antibiotics were switched over
to p.o. prior to discharge.
