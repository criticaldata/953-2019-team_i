CV: Admitted from CC-7 for 8 second-pause on telemetry and 2:1 AV dissociation/ variable heart block.  H/o severe AS - audible systolic murmur.  HR upon admission: 30s-40s, SB w/ variable block (1st degree, complete heart block), PACs/PVCs.  Adm. 3U FFP (per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1678**] (EP fellow)) in preparation for pacer introducer and temporary pacing wire.  Multiple attempts made by cardiology fellow and EP fellow - resulted in right carotid hematoma (confirmed by US).  While manual compression held on right neck, pt. became agitated w/ c/o discomfort - adm. Fentanyl 12.5mg IVP and Morphine 0.5mg IVP.  Within a few minutes, pt. developed confusion and respiratory distress, poss. vagal episode - placed on non-rebreather mask w/ fluctuating O2 sats (85-92%).  Confusion led to decreased level of consciousness and decision made to intubate pt. for airway protection (secondary to LOC and hematoma).  Intubated per anesthesia (see respiratory).  Access for temporary pacing wire obtained via right femoral vein - introducer intact w/ pacing wire placed under fluroscopy.  HR post-pacing wire: 70s-80s, NSR w/ freq. PVCs and intrinsic beats.  During vagal episode, SBP decreased to 70s, and at lowest point, SBP 47 - required high doses of Dopamine and Neo which were later weaned to off.  Temporary pacing wire settings: VVI, HR 70-80, mV 2, mA 10, sensitivity threshold 0.4.  Positive sensitivity and capture - PCM tested by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1678**] (EP fellow).  PCM site w/ slight ooze as pt.'s INR > 2.0 - applied surgi-foam dressing w/ resolution of oozing.  AM INR 1.7 (s/p 3U FFP transfusion) - Vitamin K 10mg subQ adm. as ordered.  Hct trending down (29.2 -> 26.2 -> 22.7) - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 721**] aware - awaiting blood transfusion when blood available.  Lytes in AM repleted as ordered.

RESP: Arrived to unit w/ no subjective sx's of respiratory compromise. Denied SOB, DOE.  Lungs clear in bilateral apices, diminished in LLL w/ RLL fine crackles.  On MDIs at home.  Developed respiratory distress during poss. vagal episode - O2 sats decreased to 85% on NRB mask - anesthesia called to intubate for airway protection.  Initially intubated w/ AC/1.0/600/16/5 w/ resultant ABG: 7.47/37/510/28/4/99%.  RR decreased to 14 and FiO2 0.50 w/ ABG: 7.52/32/233/27/4/98%.  Again, RR decreased to 10 and FiO2 0.40 - ABG pending.
