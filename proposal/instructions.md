# Project Proposal Information

Before initiating any project, it is essential to develop a plan. Planning ensures that the project can be
done effectively, and that components are defined in sufficient detail to facilitate efficient execution.

The purpose of this assignment is to introduce the process of planning research projects prior to their
initiation. The format roughly follows what may be submitted as part of a funding request or grant
application, or alternatively one might receive something similar from a colleague when working as a
data analyst or biostatistician. The plan for data analysis is not required, as this topic has not yet been
covered in the course, but it is also an important topic to cover in a proposal.

Each group is required to submit a draft proposal and final proposal for the project representing the
group’s combined efforts. For students taking the course for credit, the draft and final proposals will
contribute to the course grade as delineated in the course syllabus.

### Due Dates

Proposals should be uploaded to project group’s github repository as Markdown files.
Draft Proposal Due: September 29, 2018.
Final Proposal Due: October 14, 2018.

### Format

Identical for both the draft and final proposals.
Length: ≤2 pages (single spaced, not including references and acknowledgements)

#### Suggested outline:

- Background
- Research Hypotheses
- Research Question and Objectives
- Data Sources
- Study Population
- Study Outcomes
- Covariate of Interest (Exposure)
- Confounders

Each element is described in more detail below.

### Evaluation:

The draft (~30%) and final (~70%) proposals are worth 20% of the final course grade.

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria, each with approximately equally weight:
1. Defining the problem and putting it in context (i.e. where is the gap in knowledge?)
2. Identifying the elements of the study (outcome, population, covariates, etc.)
3. Technical Aspects (identifying where those elements are going to come from)
4. Project Feasibility
5. Writing Style / Efficient Use of Space

(Parts 3. and 5. may be less emphasized in the draft.)

## Brief discussion of what should go in each section:

### Background:

Explain the rationale behind the study. Discuss what other similar studies have done, why they were
insufficient, and what gaps this study will fill in. If replicating a study, just simply say that.

### Research Hypotheses:

Describe what the study hypotheses are.

### Research Question / Objective:

Describe exactly what one is aiming to accomplish in the study. Be sure to identify study outcome(s),
covariate(s) of interest, most important confounders, relevant time points, and the study population.
In general, it is better to have several objectives (usually <5) than a complicated single one.

### Data Sources:

Describe where the data will come from. Does it involve any additional data linkages? What versions
of the database will be used? Does it involve PHI?

### Study Population:

Describe who will be included in the study. It is often easiest to describe in terms of inclusion and/or
exclusion criteria. Remember, this defines the population for which the results will be generalizable.

### Study Outcomes:

Describe the study outcomes in detail. Where are these variables extracted from in the database(s)?
Are there relevant codes (e.g., ICD-9/10) that should be used to define the outcome? Include any
important time points, formulae, or subsets of the population relevant to the study outcome.

### Covariate(s) of Interest (Exposure):

Describe in detail the covariate(s) of specific interest. Include any relevant time points and a formula if
necessary. How should the covariates be modeled (e.g. continuously, categorically [and the categories
if not obvious], etc.)? Is it hypothesized that one or more covariates change the effect on the outcome
of one of the others (i.e. effect modification)?

### Confounders:

Describe important and potential confounders when examining the relationship between the
outcome and the covariates of interest. How should these variables be defined? It is also useful to
group these by type (e.g. demographic, disease severity, labs, etc.).

### Acknowledgements:

Please acknowledge the contributions from any persons not included in the proposal’s authorship.

### References:

Include the details for any other works referenced.
