# Final Project Grading

The final project is worth 50% of your total final grade. Marking is  distributed between maintaining the project repositories, a final group presentation, and a final group report.

## Project Repositories (40% of final project grade)
Demonstrating and maintaining your code to promote reproducibility and replicability is an essential practice towards improving research. More instructions forthcoming
- Organization of this repository
- Completeness of code

## Presentation (Date of presentations: Dec. 6, 2019 -	30% of final project grade)
- 8 minute presentation followed by 4 minutes Q&A.
- We recommend 6-8 slides total, excluding title slide and acknowledgements.
- We further encourage the entire team to present but understand if that is not feasible.

### Grading breakdown:

#### Preparedness (25%)
- Well organised, good time management, smooth transitions between presenters
#### Content (25%)
- Logical structure, succinct and relevant information
#### Scientific soundness (25%)
- Sufficiently described methodology, appropriate methodology, appropriate conclusions
#### Presentation (25%)
- Clearly audible, avoids jargon, clear and well labelled figures, no small fonts

## Final Report (Deadline: Dec. 13, 2019 - 30% of final project grade)
The format of the final paper should follow the target journal formatting guidelines (word count, citation style, etc).

### Grading breakdown:

#### Introduction (15%)
- Is there a descriptive background?
- Is an adequate motivation provided?
- Are the key concepts of the hypothesis described?

#### Methods (15%)
