# Predicting mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock

## Abstract

We hypothesize will be able to develop a parsimonious risk prediction model among patients with cardiogenic shock in the cardiac ICU. Moreever, we hypothesize that this model will be able to achieve better discrimination than existing models.

We've developed an accurate mortality prediction model for patients with CS and validated on eICU and MIMIC throughout the course of this semester.
